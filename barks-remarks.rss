			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Hosts: Warren Harmon &amp; Dan Severino</p>
<p>Welcome listeners! Join us in "Forbidden Valley," a clear take on the Lost World archetype, and a plot remake of "in Darkest Africa!" We've got the first appearance (arguably) of the villain McSwine (here by a more pickle-themed name) and a tale of dangerous animals, small, medium, and large!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Hosts: Ryan Bailey &amp; Veikko Suvanto</p>
<p>Listener, have you ever bought something you regretted? Scrooge McDuck has: a one-trillion dollar auction purchase of an orb of Bombastium, a rare and mysterious element. Unfortunately, the sphere must be kept frozen, thus the ducks end up traveling to the mountains of Antarctica, pursued by a representative from the U.S.S.R-inspired country of Brutopia, whose happy people possess all of five kitchen sinks. Join us as we discuss this story's geopolitical issues, unusual censorship, inspired slapstick, and facts about penguins!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ten-Page Podcast: New Year's Revolutions (1955) / Secret Resolutions (1956)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Hosts: Patrick Block &amp; Warren Harmon</p>
<p>Happy New Year! Are you the type to make a resolution? Donald and the nephews certainly are, in these memorable New Year stories, released in back-to-back years. New Year's Revolutions is an entertaining enough story, but Secret Resolutions is the real treat, with its (admittedly low-stakes) mystery structure and decadent drawings of Carl Barks-invented pastries. Why not resolve to enjoy the episode, and to listen to more podcasts!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: David Wolpaw</p>
<p>Greetings listeners! This week we are covering two stories that observe that most American of holidays, Thanksgiving! For international readers, Barks' Thanksgiving stories must offer some humorous insight into this turkey-focused holiday. First up, "the Terrible Turkey," one of those stories where Donald is obsessed with getting a turkey the old-fashioned way. Then, "a Charitable Chore," a story about the challenges posed by unwanted holiday guests...in this case, cousin Gladstone! Both stories feature Donald blithely ignoring the opportunity to double-check something that turns out to be important! Whether you are observing this holiday or not, a happy holiday season to you!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ten-Page Podcast: the Riddle of the Red Hat (1945)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Guest Hosts: Thad Komorowski & Debbie Perry
Greetings listeners! In celebration of Mickey Mouse's birthday, on November 18th, we bring you this episode devoted to the ONLY Mickey Mouse story the Duck Man wrote and drew! The Riddle of the Red Hat is an unusual ten (actually eleven)-pager, and we take advantage of the opportunity to discuss Floyd Gottfredson, the famed Mickey comics artist and plotter that was one of Barks' principal inspirations. We discuss how the artists got involved with Mickey, how Barks found inspiration from Gottfredson, and the two artists' meetings later in life.

Dutch artists Henrieke Goorhuis (returning) and Tim Artz (new to the podcast) join me as we discuss these fun and offbeat spooky stories, which include a reality-bending invention from Gyro Gearloose in his second (non-cameo) appearance and one of Barks' most memorable creatures, Wispy Willie, the Will-o'-the-Wisp/Jack-O'-Lantern!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: John Lustig</p>
<p>Time to visit, albeit briefly and in disguise, the tiny town of Omelet, site of one of the greatest disasters Donald Duck ever inflicted on a town! Omelet is an utter classic, a very personal story in which Barks drew from his personal experiences raising chickens, and is the ten-pager he often mentioned as being his favorite of his short stories. Check out this special episode as I'm joined by the Disney comics writer John Lustig as we particularly focus on Barks writing and story-telling in this all-time classic.</p>

<p>What's that in that bottle floating to shore? It appears to be this week's podcast, where we discuss the early Scrooge adventure "the Mysterious Stone Ray!" This is a unique adventure story, tinged with a creepy sense of mystery and a real science-fiction influence! Definitely not an episode to listen to on an empty stomach, unless you're a fan of cabbages and prunes!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ten-Page Podcast: Truant Stories, including Truant Officer Donald (1949), Truant Nephews (1951), & Travelling Truants (1954)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Patrick Block</p>
<p>Playing hooky, listeners? The Truant Officer will deliver you where you're supposed to be: listening to this episode! This themed episode looks at Barks' 3 stories that were all about truancy, where the nephews ditch school! "Truant Officer Donald" is probably the most famous, but don't sleep on the other two! Revisiting these three similarly-themed stories is a great way to explore how Barks was able to develop fresh plotlines over the years. And the subject of Truant Officers seems like such a weird time capsule now (though technically they still exist in the U.S.).&nbsp;</p>

This themed episode looks at Barks&apos; 3 stories that were all about truancy, where the nephews ditch school! &quot;Truant Officer Donald&quot; is probably the most famous, but don&apos;t sleep on the other two! Revisiting these three similarly-themed stories is a great way to explore how Barks was able to develop fresh plotlines over the years. And the subject of Truant Officers seems like such a weird time capsule now (though technically they still exist in the U.S.).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[43 - the Seven Cities of Cibola]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Guest Host: Warren Harmon
Greetings, listeners -- can we interest you in a new business venture, that is, finding arrowheads in the desert? How about a new podcast episode? "The Seven Cities of Cibola," holds a special place as Barks' first "real" treasure hunt with Scrooge. Listen as my host and I discuss the story's semi-realistic inspiration, Barks' shiftless Beagle Boys, and some of the overused tropes Barks used in this otherwise delightful story.

			<title><![CDATA[Ten-Page Podcast: a Financial Fable (1951) (Scroogeanomics, Part 1)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Sara Santiago</p>
<p>Greetings listeners! This episode is a bit unusual as it is the beginning of a 2-part episode we are dubbing "Scroogeanomics." In the first part, we'll be exploring one of the Duck Man's most famous ten-pagers, "a Financial Fable," and considering what it tells us about Barks' free-market philosophy and opinions about capitalism and economics. The episode will conclude next time by exploring the thematically similar "Spending Money," as well as other economically themed stories.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Patrick Block</p>
<p>Listener, has the pace of being a modern, 1950s zillionaire got you down? On the verge of cracking up? Don't go off to live with the squirrels, instead give our episode about one of Barks' all-time greats, "Tralla La" a listen! This fan favorite, widely-known as "the bottlecap story," is Barks' amazing take on the old Shangri-La/Shambala legend, popularized in the book "Lost Horizon" and in Frank Capra's film adaptation. The story is an incredible work of art that ponders identity, wealth, assimilation, and provides one of Barks' most fascinating economics experiments.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Ryan Bailey</p>
<p>Hello listeners, join us for an underwater adventure that starts out rather innocuously. "Atlantis" features a great, twisty tale that starts with a squabble over a debt, advances to the world's greatest 2-D pie fight, and ultimately ends up with the discovery of the lost city of Atlantis! The story also includes notable first appearance of Scrooge McDuck's Worry Room and the Junior Woodchucks guidebook (here: book of knowledge).</p>

			<title><![CDATA[40 - the Menehune Mystery]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Guest Hosts: Warren Harmon & Sara Santiago. Aloha listeners, we are up to Uncle Scrooge #4, and the Menehune Mystery, a real departure for Carl Barks. This is arguably the first story in the Scrooge line not concerned with establishing Scrooge's origin and mythos. The story is an excellent example of one of Barks' frequent story typologies: Scrooge hiding his money somewhere. That somewhere ends up being Hawai'i, in a sort of vacation gone wrong. Apart from the tropical location, the story is notable for being Barks' first major artistic collaboration with new wife Garé, who helped with the background work and suggested the idea, based on knowledge of the folklore of her previous home state. It features some great Beagle Boy antics, fascinating cultural information about Hawai'i, and one of Barks' sappiest endings!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Hosts: Patrick Block &amp; Warren Harmon</p>
<p>Greetings, listeners! Carl Barks extracted a lot of comedic potential out of Donald's many jobs! In this episode, we'll cover 3 of his many, MANY professions: volunteer firefighter, hotel manager, and milkman, as well as delve briefly into his many other jobs. "Fireman Donald" is an all-time classic ten-pager, while "Sagmore Springs Hotel" is an essential Donald-in-charge story. "The Milkman Story" is a special case; an underexposed story that was originally taken off the publication schedule; it is little-read and has a unique tone, so be sure to track it down!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Austin Kelly</p>
<p>Happy summer! In this episode we tackle three summer themed stories focused on summer break, swimming, and vacations! "Pool Sharks" from 1951 is the standout story: one of Barks' all-time greatest ten-pagers, in which Donald replaces his backyard garden with a swimming pool, before things go horribly awry. Then, in "Swimming Swindlers," an early Barks story from 1946, the nephews attempt to cheat Donald in a swimming contest, where things go horribly awry. Finally, in "Houseboat Holiday," Donald tries to keep the nephews out of trouble during their houseboat vacation, only to have things...well, you probably guessed it!&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[38 - Back to the Klondike]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Hosts: Joakim Gunnarson &amp; Henrieke Goorhuis</p>
<p>Listeners, we finally get to release our highly anticipated episode covering one of Barks' all-time classic, "Back to the Klondike!" This story, from Four Color #456/Uncle Scrooge #2 is one of Barks' most legendary stories, dealing with Scrooge's memories of his time in the Klondike gold rush! The story is famous for many reasons, including the first and only appearance of Glittering Goldie, the Star of the North, the only girl who ever gave Scrooge "that faraway look" in his eyes. The story is almost as famous for the content of the pages that were originally censored - a huge brawl in the Blackjack Ballroom, among others! But then, if you're reading this summary, you almost certainly know this story front-to-back, so trek through the Chillcoot Pass, look for four rocks marking a square, and give it a listen as my guest hosts and I discuss this all-time classic!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[37 - Trick or Treat]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Hosts: Warren Harmon &amp; Sara Santiago</p>
<p>Trick or Treat! Trick or Treat! Trick or Treat for Halloween! Listeners, if we have to have the song stuck in our head, so do you! Join us as we talk about this Barks oddity: a story with a provided concept, one based on a contemporaneous animated cartoon short (and subject to some editorial snipping). This story is a departure, but has the very memorable Witch Hazel as well as her broom, the delightful Beelzebub, and her wonderful pet ogre, say it with me: Smorgasbard, also known as Smorgie the Bad (!). So when ghosts and goblins by the score, ring the bell on your front door, better not be stingy or your nightmares will come true!</p>

<p>This episode is all about Barks' famous "statue building contest." This is one of his more outlandish ten-pagers, featuring an absolutely wild competition between Uncle Scrooge (who opens his purse strings for once, in defense of his title of world's richest man) and the Maharajah of Howduystan! The story also features some neat world-building, in the subject of the statues: Cornelius Coot, founder of Duckburg.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[36 - the Gilded Man]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Thad Komorowski</p>
<p>The Gilded Man is one of Barks' great South American-set stories, and features some frenetic hemisphere-spanning, as the ducks race to find, and then recover, a mail satchel containing the world's rarest stamp, held by the legendary El Dorado! The story includes memorable appearances from the Gilded Man himself, Philo T. Ellic, the forgetful stamp collector, and of course, Donald's infuriatingly lucky cousin, Gladstone Gander! We discuss the story's creepy atmosphere building, unusual book-end structure, great running gag, and much more!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Henrieke Goorhuis</p>
<p>Gladstone Gander, Donald's ultra-lucky cousin, makes for a great foil for Donald. In this episode we'll talk about Gladstone and explore two of the all-time greatest Gladstone stories, one (Gladstone Returns) from before Barks imbued him with his supernatural luck and one (Gladstone's Terrible Secret) from afterwards, and in a rare example of Barks at least obliquely pondering where the Gander's luck comes from! As a bit of a bonus, we'll even get to talk about the initial appearance of another famous secondary character, as the latter story was the first ever appearance of Gyro Gearloose!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Austin Kelly</p>
<p>It's our big Money Bin episode! We've got a double feature of two of Barks classic stories featuring one of his greatest non-character creations, Scrooge McDuck's Money Bin! "Big Bin" is the showcase this episode, as it really set the template for Scrooge's relationship with the building that secures his money and all its sundry defenses. "Round Money Bin" is a fun story as well, and includes the first allusion to Scrooge's #1 dime. We'll also talk about Salmon P. Chase, the guy whose face graces the $10,000 bill and briefly discuss other great stories featuring the money bin, including by other creators!</p>

Join us as we talk about this, the last full length story before Scrooge gets his own spin-off title.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Thad Komorowski</p>
<p>Careful about knocking on our door, listeners, you might get a face full of Boer War surplus cannon! "Terror of the Beagle Boys" is one of Barks' most iconic Scrooge-centric ten-pagers, a sort of two-man stage play where the looming threat is almost beside the point. Join us as we talk about that iconic cannon, Barks' ancient messenger boys, and the great character work that went into this "Waiting for Godot"-like story!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Patrick Block</p>
<p>This episode is a real treat, as it features this all-time great ten-pager (currently the highest ranked on INDUCKS), and because I am joined by Patrick Block, the great duck artist who got to both meet and collaborate with Carl Barks! We have a great conversation about the Duck Man's best ten-pagers, the absurdity of the rare collectibles industry, and many of Patrick's great remembrances and impressions of Barks.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[32 - Donald Duck in Old California!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Guest Hosts: Warren Harmon & Sara Santiago. Greetings, travelers! Have a sniff of these strange herbs, and come with us, back to old California! This all-time great story is one of Carl Barks' most deeply personal, as it takes place in the vicinity of his home of San Jacinto and draws inspiration from the old novel "Ramona," adapted into an outdoor pageant annually. This story stands apart, as the Duck Man's most romantic, and one that pines for California before the rat race. There is a lot to say about this wistfully nostalgic and fantastical romance!

			<title><![CDATA[Ten-Page Podcast: the Duck in the Iron Pants and Other Stories from Barks' Early Career (1943-1944)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Warren Harmon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing can save you from this podcast! It is invincible! It is doom itself!</p>
<p>Actually, this episode of the Ten-Page Podcast is all about a carefully curated selection of FIVE of the Duck Man's earliest ten-pagers. We talk about his first ten-pager, "the Victory Garden," a sort of trial-by-assignment that Barks drew but didn't write, followed by his first solo outing, "the Rabbit's Foot." Next we cover the goofy "Salesman Donald," forerunner to so many Donald-gets-a-job stories. After that comes the story that gets the episode's top billing, "the Duck in the Iron Pants," the highlight of his early ten-pagers, and finally, "the Mad Chemist," one of Barks' first out-of-this-world stories. Join us as we talk about Carl Barks' origins and the early evolution of his stories!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Circus! This venerable institution was once a beloved American tradition, and the arrival of the circus train might cause the town to shut down in excitement! Times have certainly changed, and the circus is nearly extinct. But in 1950, when Barks' Big-Top Bedlam was published, every TV show or comic series would certainly have had a circus-themed episode or show. This is what struck me most as we discussed Big-Top Bedlam, a rather slapstick adventure full of one-in-a-million coincidences and the lying-one's-way-into-more-trouble trope.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[26 - Vacation Time]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Vacation Time! This Carl Barks classic pulls a bit of a bait-and-switch -- nominally a fun vacation-themed romp, it turns into a surprisingly tense survival story at the end. One of the all-time greats, Vacation Time is Barks at his best, with wonderful art, an atypically grounded storyline, and a strong conservationist through-line. My guest host and I talk about this, as well as the possible influence of Bambi, the comic's look at forest fighting, and much more!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ten-Page Podcast: the Sunken Yacht (1949)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Ryan Bailey</p>
<p>Happy 2022! This episode is pretty loaded for an episode of the 10PP; we are talking about the Sunken Yacht, one of the earlier 10-pagers featuring Uncle Scrooge McDuck in rascal/antagonist mode. This is the "ping pong" story, that sees the ducks attempt to raise Scrooge's sunken vessel using thousands of the plastic balls, and it is one of the most famous Barks stories outside of Duck Comics fandom, due to being featured in places like Mythbusters, Popular Mechanics, and so forth.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ten-Page Podcast: Wintertime Wager (1948)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host; Sara Santiago</p>
<p>Happy Holidays! "Wintertime Wager" is a classic Ten-Pager, the story that famously introduces Gladstone Gander, before Barks had assigned him his supernatural good luck! It also, by technicality, serves as our holiday episode, as the ducks briefly reference it being Christmas at the very beginning! This is a great slapstick story, and rife with opportunities to talk about lemonade, sub-zero swimming, and to explore some of the internalized anxiety at the root of Donald and Gladstone's ridiculous yet hilarious wagers!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[24 - in Ancient Persia]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Curious about the contents of this episode? Be careful, sometimes curiosity kills the cat! "In Ancient Persia" is an all-time classic Barks story, in which Donald and the kids are shanghaied into accompanying a mad scientist...or is he? oh yeah, he definitely is...on strange and creepy expedition to uncover an ancient secret. This is certainly one of Barks' creepiest stories, and is a fascinating collision between the ancient and the modern. Just like this comic bounces between spooky and goofy, we'll dive into the creepy story, but also detour into the scientist's fashion, his resemblance to Boris Karloff, and Spider-man memes. Oh, and go ahead, judge that book by its cover!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Greeting listeners! We are heading up to the Pacific Northwest, for Barks' classic kitchen sink story, Land of the Totem Poles! The title should clue you in that this 1949 story is going to have some problematic elements, but we also cover the fact that there are some aspects of the Native village that Barks at least attempted to get right! We'll also talk about totem poles themselves, steam calliopes (or is it calliopes?), and salesmanship!&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Pierre Sund</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving! For those in the United States, including Carl Barks, this is the week devoted to that family meal that features a turkey! We're celebrating with another ten-page podcast devoted to one of Barks' holiday-themed stories, the aptly-named "Turkey Trouble." This is actually the first of TWO stories that retroactively go by that title, and is the earlier one, a funny romp about the ducks acquiring not one, but two live turkeys in advance of Thanksgiving! My guest and I talk about the humor that Barks mines from his animals, the violence on display, and how this story was altered for non-U.S. audiences. Enjoy!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Feeling lucky, listeners? You should -- you've lucked into another great episode, this one being one of Barks' classic northern/arctic adventure stories featuring that infuriatingly lucky relation, Gladstone Gander! "Luck of the North" is a surprisingly deep story, that has just as much to say about guilt and redemption as it does about high adventure. My guest host (this time another longtime Barks fan!) and I have a great time nerding out about this great story, and talking about its great art and surprisingly intimate and introspective storytelling.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[20 - Letter to Santa]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ho ho ho! It's November 1st, the time when we flick the switch from the spooky season and go straight into Christmas! Luckily our chronological exploration of Barks' stories is just happening to land on the Duck Man's second full-length Christmas story, fan favorite "Letter to Santa." This memorable holiday tale features a money fight, the real Santa Claus, and the best steam shovel fight of all time! Join me and my extremely indulgent special guest (who is also my wife!) as we talk about childhood love of construction equipment and Christmas magic, artistic signifiers of the late 1940s, and what happens to beans when they get wet!&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ten-Page Podcast: Donald Duck's Worst Nightmare (1949)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Guest Host: Sara Santiago</p>
<p>Welcome to the Ten-Page Podcast! Occasional special episodes of Barks Remarks highlighting some of the Duck Man's 10-page short stories! This story felt just creepy enough to feature in the Halloween slot, and my guest host and I have a great time talking about Donald's extremely creepy series of nightmares, as well as the daffy gender politics in this one, and even some of the history of needlework and male involvement in the craft!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[19 - Voodoo Hoodoo]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Alright folks, we did it. We've now covered Voodoo Hoodoo, which is almost certainly Carl Barks' most controversial story. My guest host and I had a thoughtful conversation about the story, both the good and bad, and what the story says about the legacy of colonialism, its genesis from a horror movie scene, the two religions that make up the title, and much, much more! Be aware that there is significant and unavoidable discussion of the legacy of racism and colonialism in this episode.</p>

This is frequently cited as the Good Artist's personal favorite, and is absolutely required reading for any Barks fan!

Join us at the top of ol' Mount Demontooth, as Donald has to rescue the nephews from...the wicked witch from Snow White? This oddball story bears the hallmarks of editorial interference, as the very plot was foist on Barks by his editors who also mucked around with his ending. My newbie guest and I also discuss the other strange aspect of this story - how it supposes the existence of an industry of many-colored Christmas trees!</p>

Why not stop your Sunday drive and either track down some fearsome rustlers or curl up with a nice podcast episode about the Sheriff of Bullet Valley, your choice! This love letter to Hollywood horse operas is one of Barks' masterpieces, loved by both fans and non-fans of Westerns. So mosey on up and listen and we discuss why this is such a masterpiece, its semi-origins as a Mickey Mouse cartoon storyboard and our favorite Wild West tropes and how the comic both celebrates and subverts them.</p>

There is a lot to cover in this one, as we talk about the inspirations behind Castle McDuck and Rannoch Moor, unusual historical uses for X-Ray machines, debate the definition of the word "battlement," and much more!</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Look into our eyes...you are in our power...you are a homesick kangaroo who wants to leave a 5 star review of this podcast! Yes, welcome back to Barks Remarks! Join us, as the ducks take one of the most improbable vacations ever, an Adventure Down Under, spurred by a hypnotist who really should know better! There&apos;s a lot to unpack in this episode, as we learn about Australia and its national icon, the kangaroo, represented here by one of Barks&apos; infrequent (and actual) animal supporting characters, Mournful Mary!&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[Tonight is ye night! Lock up your children and listen to our podcast episode about Barks' masterpiece, "Ghost of the Grotto." This story, a personal favorite, sees the ducks embarking on a new adventure as kelp gatherers. The ducks are based at an island consumed with the terrible knowledge that tonight is the night every 50 years when a small boy will be kidnapped, never to be seen again. But surely the ducks don't need to worry way out at Skull Eye Reef...
Listen as we discuss this generational curse, Octopus Kaiju, kelp gathering, the common fallacy of "ye olde English" speech, and much more!

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome back! This week sees the ducks inadvertently visiting the fictional Latin American-esque country of Volcanovia, a small nation of breath-taking beauty, dangerous geological features, and...some pretty unfortunate ethnic stereotypes. My newest guest host and I talk about the story's dual high concepts: the volcano-filled country and the siesta-dependent populace, and which one works better. We also talk about U.S. war surplus, the Sleeping Mexican as a cultural icon, and volcano-powered cooking!

			<description><![CDATA[We are breaking our format rules this time, as we present TWO oddball stories in ONE super episode! These two stories are technically not 10-pagers; Firebug clocks in at whopping 13, and Atom Bomb was presented in a miniature format of 30 pages (3 panels per page). Since both stories are somewhat dark and include endings that wound up being censored, it seemed logical to pair them in this episode that also includes conversation about the clinical definition of pyromania, the utopian promise of the then-dawning Age of Atom, and much more!

Listen as we discuss what type of Donald we get in this story, talk about the shadows of WWII lurking in the background, learn about the history of organ grinders, and...isn't Jingo the Monkey the cutest?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Our first episode! My guest host Eric and I discuss Barks' first ever Duck comic: Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold! for which Barks collaborated with Jack Hannah, a collaborator from the animation studio. Barks and Hannah were given the assignment to re-purpose a cartoon script for publication, and they collaborated on the art. This would lead to a long and successful career of drawing and (starting with the comic after this one) writing Duck comics. Episode highlights include pondering Pete, the Disney villain mainstay, and the existential nature of Yellow Beak, the parrot.</p>
