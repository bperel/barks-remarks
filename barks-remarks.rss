			<title><![CDATA[Ten-Page Podcast: Statuesque Spendthrifts (1952)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[This episode is all about Barks' famous "statue building contest." This is one of his more outlandish ten-pagers, featuring an absolutely wild competition between Uncle Scrooge (who opens his purse strings for once, in defense of his title of world's richest man) and the Maharajah of Howduystan! The story also features some neat world-building, in the subject of the statues: Cornelius Coot, founder of Duckburg.

			<description><![CDATA[The Gilded Man is one of Barks' great South American-set stories, and features some frenetic hemisphere-spanning, as the ducks race to find, and then recover, a mail satchel containing the world's rarest stamp, held by the legendary El Dorado! The story includes memorable appearances from the Gilded Man himself, Philo T. Ellic, the forgetful stamp collector, and of course, Donald's infuriatingly lucky cousin, Gladstone Gander! We discuss the story's creepy atmosphere building, unusual book-end structure, great running gag, and much more!

			<title><![CDATA[Ten-Page Podcast - Gladstone Returns (1948) / Gladstone's Terrible Secret (1952)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Gladstone Gander, Donald's ultra-lucky cousin, makes for a great foil for Donald. In this episode we'll talk about Gladstone and explore two of the all-time greatest Gladstone stories, one (Gladstone Returns) from before Barks imbued him with his supernatural luck and one (Gladstone's Terrible Secret) from afterwards, and in a rare example of Barks at least obliquely pondering where the Gander's luck comes from! As a bit of a bonus, we'll even get to talk about the initial appearance of another famous secondary character, as the latter story was the first ever appearance of Gyro Gearloose!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's our big Money Bin episode! We've got a double feature of two of Barks classic stories featuring one of his greatest non-character creations, Scrooge McDuck's Money Bin! "Big Bin" is the showcase this episode, as it really set the template for Scrooge's relationship with the building that secures his money and all its sundry defenses. "Round Money Bin" is a fun story as well, and includes the first allusion to Scrooge's #1 dime. We'll also talk about Salmon P. Chase, the guy whose face graces the $10,000 bill and briefly discuss other great stories featuring the money bin, including by other creators!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[32 - Donald Duck in Old California!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Greetings, travelers! Have a sniff of these strange herbs, and come with us, back to old California! This all-time great story is one of Carl Barks' most deeply personal, as it takes place in the vicinity of his home of San Jacinto and draws inspiration from the old novel "Ramona," adapted into an outdoor pageant annually. This story stands apart, as the Duck Man's most romantic, and one that pines for California before the rat race. There is a lot to say about this wistfully nostalgic and fantastical romance!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ten-Page Podcast: the Duck in the Iron Pants and Other Stories from Barks' Early Career (1943 - 1944)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Nothing can save you from this podcast! It is invincible! It is doom itself! &lt;ahem&gt; Actually, this episode of the Ten-Page Podcast is all about a carefully curated selection of FIVE of the Duck Man's earliest ten-pagers. We talk about his first ten-pager, "the Victory Garden," a sort of trial-by-assignment that Barks drew but didn't write, followed by his first solo outing, "the Rabbit's Foot." Next we cover the goofy "Salesman Donald," forerunner to so many Donald-gets-a-job stories. After that comes the story that gets the episode's top billing, "the Duck in the Iron Pants," the highlight of his early ten-pagers, and finally, "the Mad Chemist," one of Barks' first out-of-this-world stories. Join us as we talk about Carl Barks' origins and the early evolution of his stories!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Circus! This venerable institution was once a beloved American tradition, and the arrival of the circus train might cause the town to shut down in excitement! Times have certainly changed, and the circus is nearly extinct. But in 1950, when Barks' Big-Top Bedlam was published, every TV show or comic series would certainly have had a circus-themed episode or show. This is what struck me most as we discussed Big-Top Bedlam, a rather slapstick adventure full of one-in-a-million coincidences and the lying-one's-way-into-more-trouble trope.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Vacation Time! This Carl Barks classic pulls a bit of a bait-and-switch -- nominally a fun vacation-themed romp, it turns into a surprisingly tense survival story at the end. One of the all-time greats, Vacation Time is Barks at his best, with wonderful art, an atypically grounded storyline, and a strong conservationist through-line. My guest host and I talk about this, as well as the possible influence of Bambi, the comic's look at forest fighting, and much more!</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...I count 25 episodes of Barks Remarks, 30 including the Ten-Page Podcast! You know who likes to count? Carl Barks&apos; animal creation in this story, the Pixilated Parrot! This brisk adventure is a somewhat slight story, though it possesses one of Barks&apos; all-time greatest gags! Join us as we talk about the story, the meaning of the word pixilated, Duckburg&apos;s location, and more!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Ten-Page Podcast: the Sunken Yacht (1949)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Happy 2022! This episode is pretty loaded for an episode of the 10PP; we are talking about the Sunken Yacht, one of the earlier 10-pagers featuring Uncle Scrooge McDuck in rascal/antagonist mode. This is the "ping pong" story, that sees the ducks attempt to raise Scrooge's sunken vessel using thousands of the plastic balls, and it is one of the most famous Barks stories outside of Duck Comics fandom, due to being featured in places like Mythbusters, Popular Mechanics, and so forth.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ten-Page Podcast: Wintertime Wager (1948)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Happy Holidays! "Wintertime Wager" is a classic Ten-Pager, the story that famously introduces Gladstone Gander, before Barks had assigned him his supernatural good luck! It also, by technicality, serves as our holiday episode, as the ducks briefly reference it being Christmas at the very beginning! This is a great slapstick story, and rife with opportunities to talk about lemonade, sub-zero swimming, and to explore some of the internalized anxiety at the root of Donald and Gladstone's ridiculous yet hilarious wagers!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[24 - in Ancient Persia]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Curious about the contents of this episode? Be careful, sometimes curiosity kills the cat! "In Ancient Persia" is an all-time classic Barks story, in which Donald and the kids are shanghaied into accompanying a mad scientist...or is he? oh yeah, he definitely is...on strange and creepy expedition to uncover an ancient secret. This is certainly one of Barks' creepiest stories, and is a fascinating collision between the ancient and the modern. Just like this comic bounces between spooky and goofy, we'll dive into the creepy story, but also detour into the scientist's fashion, his resemblance to Boris Karloff, and Spider-man memes. Oh, and go ahead, judge that book by its cover!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Greeting listeners! We are heading up to the Pacific Northwest, for Barks' classic kitchen sink story, Land of the Totem Poles! The title should clue you in that this 1949 story is going to have some problematic elements, but we also cover the fact that there are some aspects of the Native village that Barks at least attempted to get right! We'll also talk about totem poles themselves, steam calliopes (or is it calliopes?), and salesmanship!&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Happy Thanksgiving! For those in the United States, including Carl Barks, this is the week devoted to that family meal that features a turkey! We're celebrating with another ten-page podcast devoted to one of Barks' holiday-themed stories, the aptly-named "Turkey Trouble." This is actually the first of TWO stories that retroactively go by that title, and is the earlier one, a funny romp about the ducks acquiring not one, but two live turkeys in advance of Thanksgiving! My guest and I talk about the humor that Barks mines from his animals, the violence on display, and how this story was altered for non-U.S. audiences. Enjoy!</p>

You should -- you've lucked into another great episode, this one being one of Barks' classic northern/arctic adventure stories featuring that infuriatingly lucky relation, Gladstone Gander! "Luck of the North" is a surprisingly deep story, that has just as much to say about guilt and redemption as it does about high adventure. My guest host (this time another longtime Barks fan!) and I have a great time nerding out about this great story, and talking about its great art and surprisingly intimate and introspective storytelling.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Alright folks, we did it. We've now covered Voodoo Hoodoo, which is almost certainly Carl Barks' most controversial story. My guest host and I had a thoughtful conversation about the story, both the good and bad, and what the story says about the legacy of colonialism, its genesis from a horror movie scene, the two religions that make up the title, and much, much more! Be aware that there is significant and unavoidable discussion of the legacy of racism and colonialism in this episode.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Alright folks, we did it. We&apos;ve now covered Voodoo Hoodoo, which is almost certainly Carl Barks&apos; most controversial story. My guest host and I had a thoughtful conversation about the story, both the good and bad, and what the story says about the legacy of colonialism, its genesis from a horror movie scene, the two religions that make up the title, and much, much more! Be aware that there is significant and unavoidable discussion of the legacy of racism and colonialism in this episode.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Here it is, our episode about Carl Barks' famous "square egg" story! This is frequently cited as the Good Artist's personal favorite, and is absolutely required reading for any Barks fan! I unabashedly love this story, but do my multiple co-hosts consider it egg-cellent? And will the episode have better puns than that groaner? Yes! So join us, in Plain Awful as we get Lost in the Andes!</p>

Join us at the top of ol' Mount Demontooth, as Donald has to rescue the nephews from...the wicked witch from Snow White? This oddball story bears the hallmarks of editorial interference, as the very plot was foist on Barks by his editors who also mucked around with his ending.

This unusually spooooky story is everything we love about Carl Barks: spine-tingling adventure, a lavishly-illustrated, remote setting, and just enough comedy to keep things from getting too creepy! There is a lot to cover in this one, as we talk about the inspirations behind Castle McDuck and Rannoch Moor, unusual historical uses for X-Ray machines, debate the definition of the word "battlement," and much more!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[Tonight is ye night! Lock up your children and listen to our podcast episode about Barks' masterpiece, "Ghost of the Grotto." This story, a personal favorite, sees the ducks embarking on a new adventure as kelp gatherers. The ducks are based at an island consumed with the terrible knowledge that tonight is the night every 50 years when a small boy will be kidnapped, never to be seen again. But surely the ducks don't need to worry way out at Skull Eye Reef...
Listen as we discuss this generational curse, Octopus Kaiju, kelp gathering, the common fallacy of "ye olde English" speech, and much more!

This week sees the ducks inadvertently visiting the fictional Latin American-esque country of Volcanovia, a small nation of breath-taking beauty, dangerous geological features, and...some pretty unfortunate ethnic stereotypes. My newest guest host and I talk about the story's dual high concepts: the volcano-filled country and the siesta-dependent populace, and which one works better. We also talk about U.S. war surplus, the Sleeping Mexican as a cultural icon, and volcano-powered cooking!

			<title><![CDATA[07 - the Firebug/Donald Duck's Atom Bomb]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[We are breaking our format rules this time, as we present TWO oddball stories in ONE super episode! These two stories are technically not 10-pagers; Firebug clocks in at whopping 13, and Atom Bomb was presented in a miniature format of 30 pages (3 panels per page). Since both stories are somewhat dark and include endings that wound up being censored, it seemed logical to pair them in this episode that also includes conversation about the clinical definition of pyromania, the utopian promise of the then-dawning Age of Atom, and much more!

			<description><![CDATA[Welcome to our third full podcast, a discussion of Carl Barks' "Too Many Pets"! Listen as we discuss what type of Donald we get in this story, talk about the shadows of WWII lurking in the background, learn about the history of organ grinders, and...isn't Jingo the Monkey the cutest? This may be one of Carl Barks' more minor works (fight us), but we still enjoyed it and had a great time talking Ducks.

			<title><![CDATA[01 - Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Our first episode! My guest host Eric and I discuss Barks' first ever Duck comic: Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold! for which Barks collaborated with Jack Hannah, a collaborator from the animation studio. Barks and Hannah were given the assignment to re-purpose a cartoon script for publication,  and they collaborated on the art. This would lead to a long and successful career of drawing and (starting with the comic after this one) writing Duck comics. Episode highlights include pondering Pete, the Disney villain mainstay, and the existential nature of Yellow Beak, the parrot.
