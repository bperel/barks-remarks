1
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,495
We can have

2
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:37,825
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer an artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comments of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological

3
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:57,950
publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm mark Sever a grown man who enjoys Inducks comics and enjoys talking about them with guest hosts.

4
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:05,985
May I ask my guest host for today's episode to please introduce himself. Hi. I'm Fay Cam res. I'm a lifetime

5
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:06,965
Carl Barks.

6
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:23,835
And I've also done a lot of professional Disney comics work as far as commentary and translation and localization. Apps. Thank you so much for coming back that. I had had a lot of fun on our hours of the... That was a blast.

7
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,329
Yeah. That was a said. A letter on last.

8
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,998
Yes. That's right. Good old Borrower war, Canon. I really like having people

9
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:37,977
join me for to talk about stories that are personal or special,

10
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:41,976
to them. And we've got one that is is

11
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:45,934
today. We're we're gonna journey to British Kia

12
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:52,666
and talk about the guild man, and I gather that's a personal favorite of yours. Right? Yes. It actually is.

13
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:54,458
Interestingly,

14
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:58,167
it was the first one of Barks of stories

15
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:04,564
the long adventures anyway that I read, the first time I read it, it was in the original

16
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:06,741
publication from nineteen fifty two.

17
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:07,920
Because

18
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:20,161
our friend David Ge picked me up a copy at one of the... I think it was the Baltimore comic gum. He said like, oh, no. I got this really cheap. It's a good copy. It's one of our is best, and he sent it to me. And

19
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:21,414
Interestingly,

20
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:41,315
that grace the first Gladstone issue of Donald Duck. Yeah. That's right. They picked it for their... Their return to... For were their there beginning the publication just like we got... I think Tara the B boys was another of their first. Mh. So just... We're just checking those off If I ever branch out into

21
00:02:41,772 --> 00:03:07,190
a Floyd Gottfredson some podcast, I'll have you on for seven ghost? Oh that's one of the best Yeah. That really is. And and it's true That is this is a classic. This is one of the all time great I would say, I really like this one as well. How know that I'd call it like an all time favorite, but it's it's way up there. I've read this one. So many times, I think I first read it in their giant album

22
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:14,065
where where it was... It was paired with a couple of Barks other South American team stories.

23
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:25,001
What to talk about little little bit of the background for this one, you know, you mentioned that four color publication it was originally in four color four hundred and twenty two and

24
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:34,207
so so you've got an actual copy of that one which is pretty neat. It's always thought the cover was the cover art was interesting and a little bit misleading. Right?

25
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,720
A little bit as,

26
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,160
you know, El dorado himself is depicted like as as just a giant

27
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:47,929
So I I imagine that some people might have been left down by that original one but

28
00:03:48,347 --> 00:04:05,375
Al any rate, July of nineteen fifty two is the publication date. Had a good number of reprint in the Us as most of these all times have. Nine counting the original And this is a thirty two page. So there's there's a lot to cover here. It's it's among his longer stories.

29
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:21,012
I'm very interested that when I when I think about these stories, kind of the thesis of these episodes is, what is special about the guild man? Right? What makes this one notable, what makes it unique among Barks stories

30
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,632
right away, we've got a we've got a somewhat rare Gladstone

31
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:47,546
adventure story. Do you think about Glad in the adventure length once? Oh, he is always a great prank. I I love him and these stories. He's always the ins of the trouble and some capacity when he... And whenever he shows up It's just always, you know, you're you're guaranteed to have an irritable good time. I'm not sure if you mentioned it on the

32
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:58,928
shell before, but, of course, Carl wife, hated Gladstone with a passion. But, you know, I I I just always loved them. It because he's the guy everyone loves to hate. So... Yeah.

33
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:04,836
In addition to Bark wife, which I actually didn't know. So thanks for sharing that.

34
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:07,111
But you you can tell that Barks

35
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:17,895
himself. Hates Gladstone. Do would. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he he he created ham right, so I'm sure he has a certain infection form him, but he's really a character

36
00:05:18,312 --> 00:05:22,562
of the type of like flight coming easily to success

37
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:30,042
that that you you can tell really annoys him. So I always thought that was an interesting dynamic. Yeah. And he always...

38
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:40,625
At every opportunity, he gets him pom by and a fight with Donald that it's not something you see a lot of actual physical combat and these stories. So

39
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:53,133
that aggression somewhere. Yeah. You probably get more of it with Gladstone than just about anyone. Yeah. And and you know, it's interesting to me how Gladstone kinda he doesn't go along for the adventure. No

40
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,775
one. Unlike some of the other ones. Mh. So I really like

41
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:12,090
There's there's a lot I have to say I have a lot of thoughts about this one, but I kinda wanna integrate it into our conversation about the story itself, but but that is what I wanna come back to. You know what What is special about this one? What is unique about this story?

42
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:21,635
There there are a couple of cool elements to this though. Were you ever a stamp collector? Were you ever a fan of phil? I I assume how accent.

43
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:25,662
I only had a couple of the cartoon character stamps.

44
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,891
My father would always buy me those when they came out. They had a couple with the warner characters

45
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,357
when I was kid. But beyond that,

46
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:44,959
they're collecting dust somewhere in frames. So. Yeah. It feels very old, fashioned, but this that's a good hook for this one. Right? I don't think spam collecting is nearly as popular

47
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:46,495
as it was.

48
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:54,273
Went when this was published. And there's some interesting, like, real world connections with the the famed

49
00:06:54,691 --> 00:07:02,146
Magenta stamp. Right? I I think that Without question that's one of the most interesting aspects of this story because

50
00:07:02,484 --> 00:07:07,185
the the like Mc, the treasure that they're hunting after is not this legend

51
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,324
artifact or anything. It's like this real piece of a thumb that was published

52
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:16,409
put out by by the British post office

53
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:29,475
a hundred years before and in researching this, like, that... There's only one actual magenta stamp out there. Right? And I I came to learn about this, like, ra

54
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:30,751
scheme

55
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:33,038
that the, like stamp

56
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:39,190
slash venture capitalist Barks who have acquired it Have now.

57
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:44,573
So you can if you are so inclined become a fractional

58
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:46,808
owner of the actual

59
00:07:47,386 --> 00:07:52,370
Magenta stan. My. Have you ever heard of this that fracture I? I've

60
00:07:52,788 --> 00:08:02,894
probably heard of that concept that expressed another way but this does sound a little out there. Yeah. Yeah I mean, it's kinda to me, it's kinda random reminiscent of an N f t.

61
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:04,471
Basically,

62
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:07,480
they'll sell you a a steak in the actual

63
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,700
one penny magenta stamp for a hundred and transferable bucks.

64
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,774
You can you can buy a tiny little piece of it. So

65
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:24,728
Stanley Gibbons is the... Is the collection house. You cannot you can Google it. And, you know, if it was like twenty or thirty bucks I might have gone for it, but

66
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:36,209
I I don't think I'm gonna blow a hundred and thirty bucks on it. Let's see. We're we're gonna get into the story in due time. I do want pan a little bit to the international

67
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:42,897
the international crowd by sharing a couple of the titles from reprint from around the world.

68
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:49,581
Just in brief I will mention a couple that I really like. I like just the straight up

69
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:56,798
Which is just donald versus the man of gold and Italian very straightforward.

70
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:59,843
And then I think I need some French

71
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:07,235
speaker to clue in because there's there's a title... The French title, it seems like it's a pun. It's

72
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:08,513
tame

73
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:09,670
du,

74
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:21,450
the stamps of the stamp but I'm I'm guessing there's, like, some kind of pun that I'm missing Hopefully, someone can fill me in on that. That'll do it for the international titles.

75
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,290
That there's some pretty cool, like,

76
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:24,604
historical

77
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:25,843
mythology

78
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:36,319
built into this one too. Right? What do you think that? Do you... Do you know much about the Legend of Al auto, the guild man. I just know what the movies told me. I've have never

79
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:41,040
pursued that. Yeah. So I mean, I I try to research these pretty well.

80
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:43,030
I don't wanna go

81
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:45,622
too deep into it, but

82
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:58,390
this is like, Al an a legend that's based on some fat right there there really was this gil man who was the chief of the the tribe in this area.

83
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:08,215
Barb apparently got the, like, the place a little bit wrong. It's actually like a thousand or so miles to the west in Columbia where

84
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:10,628
where there was this coronation ritual

85
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:13,465
among the the cheap shop people

86
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:17,700
and and between six hundred and sixteen hundred,

87
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:26,165
They had this ritual where the new king would be covered with gold dust before he lap into this, like, crater lake called Lake Al.

88
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:37,035
So well... And I didn't see it in your notes there, Barks, but this story actually got remade a couple of years later. I believe it was in nineteen sixty.

89
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:40,275
Palm Murray drew it with Mickey and Al nephews.

90
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:50,645
It's a pretty shock for shot remake but Yeah. Yeah. You're right. I didn't mention that I I I figured you might share. They're... I think there's been a couple of mouse

91
00:10:51,223 --> 00:11:04,235
remake, because I remember reading one in glad that I don't think was the one with with More and Fe, but but maybe maybe my memory is playing with me because... Yeah. That it was like beat for be almost exactly the same.

92
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,642
Well, well, in this case, it was not a flattering

93
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:08,694
comparison

94
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:22,130
because, you know, people probably know it. I am not a fan of pulmonary work. Now and it's actually good a little more jade over time because Palmer Murray was not a fan of Carl Barks.

95
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:39,571
Yeah. He he was very critical of him, and I kinda think he was jealous of his popularity. I was gonna ask, do you think that's a jealous thing? I mean, You would think he'd be make taking shots at Got and more than Barks or something. But... Well, God was in a different

96
00:11:40,004 --> 00:11:43,693
he was in the newspaper era. Yeah. Yeah. But

97
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:55,205
no. But he was rare among... He was rare among the contemporary is a lot anyone else just had good things to say about them. People like Tony str and a couple others. Yeah.

98
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:56,542
But,

99
00:11:57,413 --> 00:12:01,345
we're not talking about that story. We're talking about the original. That's right.

100
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:13,230
Yeah. You know, I I could probably name a couple of Murray stories that I remember fondly and enjoy, but I I wouldn't call myself a a big fan. Right. Yeah. And

101
00:12:14,063 --> 00:12:23,078
let's let's go ahead and get into it. There is a lot say because, again, this is a thirty two pager. So That you and I are gonna

102
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:25,355
describe the story in turn

103
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:26,194
and

104
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:27,951
share are cutting

105
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:28,730
insights.

106
00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:40,626
And I'm gonna go ahead and open this, start us off with the intro page. Alright. So the gil man has an opening that sees Donald

107
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:41,465
Basically,

108
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:57,490
we we were introduced to Donald in his new hobby of stamp collecting, and he is in front of a large prominent map of South America. We're getting a lot of information. Right? Barks telling us a lot about the story in that opening panel

109
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:06,257
we're we're getting our destination. We're getting what it's gonna be all about. He's listing off some various stamps and their values.

110
00:13:06,675 --> 00:13:10,528
As the nephews enter asking him to take them

111
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:17,193
to a movie. And so the Nephews basically in short they accuse him of wasting his time.

112
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:22,905
And he expresses his annoyed and that he's annoyed, and he

113
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:27,705
educate them about stamp collecting being a quote big business.

114
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:31,749
Need tells us, he tells them and us the reader

115
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:33,344
about a particular

116
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:37,150
stamp that is worth more than fifty thousand dollars.

117
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:49,008
And I guess we're talking about a half a million Barks or so in in contemporary money. Yes. And the nephews have have a little quit, but why don't you buy one of them and spend the rest of your life paying for it.

118
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:51,023
And Donald,

119
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,785
she back. He's not gonna buy one. He's gonna sell one. And this is another one of Donald fo,

120
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:03,265
you know, one of these brilliant plants. He wants to raise enough money so he can go hunting for it. And

121
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:07,157
it's not it it's the making of good comic book,

122
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:08,796
but this is

123
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:18,034
a sensible idea. It's just as much of a gamble as anything else he's done. And quite around, he's gonna encounter Gladstone and this has.

124
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:48,010
So donald goes dumpster diving, literally looking for rare stamps. And Gladstone catches them. Just have his what he thinks is down Al low as grounding around in waste bins. Yeah. That's right. He's gonna encounter him. We get... We get the impression that Donald has been going to the railroad station a lot. To look through these waste baskets, and we get... We get these lists and he's... He is unable bragging to Glad stone about how much

125
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:52,297
money or value he's made in finding these

126
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:54,293
stamps in short

127
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:58,260
and very predictably, we know it's gonna happen Donald

128
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,200
he's gonna... He's gonna light a fire under Al Gladstone

129
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:11,307
who is going to use the old Gladstone stonewall what, he... He himself says it, u. Me and my big mouth, I've got glad done

130
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:12,665
started on

131
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,480
camps, and we hit this narrator box that informs us ten seconds pass

132
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,800
before the past

133
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:31,124
kicks in and and he comes back calling an entire album and and that really quick before you go to the next page, I love the book.

134
00:15:31,621 --> 00:15:37,085
In in this story. Right? I I love how we start with this Donald than Gladstone

135
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:38,622
almost like a ten pager.

136
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:49,619
Mh. And then we get adventure, and then it's like we're we're back to to finish off the ten page or almost. Or it's almost like two different ten pages book ending adventures.

137
00:15:49,957 --> 00:16:15,009
It's an interesting structure for this one. Well this is more of Carl Barks is careful planning. This is he's introducing this element because it's going to eventually pay off later in the story. He's not gonna be Gladstone in the first couple of pages. And as we see, donald calls Gladstone a jug had because Glad don't think she's gotten himself an instant stamp collection, but what he's really gotten is somebody else's

138
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:26,989
it which just happens to beneath the railroad station and he goes to see final Al there we go. Tell us about the name that. Yeah. No. It's on. A Al is a stamp collector.

139
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:29,169
So that's just

140
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:53,234
more more of that clever word play Carlos known for I love it. So clever went over my head just there. Well Well, I think I can't imagine how many times I read this as like a nine year old before I before I picked up on what it actually meant Right. And Gladstone is of course being his usual self. He wants to keep them waiting because the reward will be bigger. But Donald

141
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:55,274
is a firm conscience,

142
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:56,714
and he

143
00:16:57,054 --> 00:17:00,329
being a fellow stamp collector, he does not want to see

144
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:17,284
that kind of exploitation So they go to one hundred twenty week board Drive, We get we get Donald being guided by his conscience quite a bit in this one Or or at least, like, kind of battling with his conscience. It comes into to play. It tends to more in these glad

145
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:37,562
stories. So so we head to millionaire row I like Barks ridiculous address is this This time we're on swan more drive and we get to meet this f t Al and I find him super memorable. He is hilarious. He's one of my favorite parts of this story here Al that. Well, he's so.

146
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:48,559
You can't you can't white them. Right. Right. He's he's rich. Obviously, he lives on millionaire air row. He's a lot more c than say uncle screwed. For example. Right.

147
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:55,213
And he's a total debts. His his whole thing is that he he has a terrible memory.

148
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:59,848
Right. This is gonna be the running gag throughout the story.

149
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:03,938
I'm here for it. I love I love f.

150
00:18:04,437 --> 00:18:06,854
Yeah. And and he realizes that

151
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,931
Gladstone has returned his famous orient

152
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,750
collection.

153
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:20,716
And and we get this little bit where he's like, considering how did I how did I lose it and he realizes, you know, we're gonna get we're gonna get these comic

154
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:25,600
inter lives where he's he's leaving things behind. Very valuable things behind

155
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,438
and

156
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:30,444
in absent mind, And so key

157
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:32,104
rewards Gladstone.

158
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:34,244
But we get we get the first

159
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:53,178
instance of one of Barks, I think one of his all time best running gag that. Yes. We're gonna get a different name. He's gonna miss remember Gladstone name every time and he's gonna refer to him as mister Garfield this first time. Well he keeps forgetting who Gladstone actually is too. Yeah.

160
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:55,113
Yeah. It's great.

161
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,799
So he rewards him with a thousand

162
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:58,678
dollars.

163
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:01,195
And and just leaves Donald

164
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:09,635
stew. Yes. Because it was just enough to get him down to South America as well. And Donald literally just sits there to salt. And

165
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:17,745
it's one of the more brilliantly paced pages and Barks stuff because it it it just plays out. Like, so file Al can logically

166
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,144
forget what had just happened because Donald been sitting there so long. But, of course, that only happens the passage of two handles.

167
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:29,464
Right. And, you know, he calls a mister Al Gin.

168
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:32,256
He thinks donald this Gladstone

169
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:42,951
and that he hasn't given him the reward money yet. And donald wig out. He's telling him no. No. No No. Don't don't give me this. And this is this is why I love file

170
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:56,354
because these pushy like, seeing too it that he keeps the money. See him out. It's like, Imagine mister Garland Goose pimples didn't Water Reward how confounded noble can a person get. And Donald is thrown out with a thousand bucks

171
00:19:56,893 --> 00:20:03,056
I love that line. I'm so glad that you read it. Yeah. I love that that next name of his

172
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:24,119
And I I like his outrage, like, he he the only time he becomes heated and not Al is because he really wants to make make things right. He wants reward him. So this is this is great. This next page Donald is walking out with a thousand bucks in hand, and he's got this like, internal battle that he's got here. Mh

173
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:33,754
Because he he knows, you know, it's not ethical to take it. It's not his. But but he does this thing that, like, a human being would definitely

174
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:37,110
do. Well, like say you can easily... He rationalize

175
00:20:37,769 --> 00:21:02,307
it... He as he's walking away, You know, he doesn't even stop. He just... Mh he walks out, he thinks I don't wanna make him feel silly by returning it, and he I don't want him. Bear with him. He's such a nice guy. And then kind of the the the final blow is that he talks himself into... I'll give him first crap at buying the magenta stamp. Mh.

176
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:04,958
And just like that, he's rationalize

177
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:06,012
it. You know?

178
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:15,899
Mister Alex not gonna miss, I guess. So... Right. Yes. This this page is very reminiscent of the luck of the North page, which I'm sure you discussed

179
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:25,460
With this conscience. That quite as good, but it... This is what separates Carl Barks from the other creators. They never had

180
00:21:25,855 --> 00:21:35,235
the other guys never had their characters have this kind of internal time. Right? And make you... And make you really feel Al. Not someone else. There's no parallel

181
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:45,990
Yeah. You you're absolutely right. This this is brilliant this internal battle. The steaks aren't as high as luck of the north, but it's still the equivalent of ten thousand bucks.

182
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:46,828
So...

183
00:21:47,565 --> 00:22:05,235
Yeah. I I won't criticize Donald too hard because whatever, it gets us it gets us to the next part of the story. This this is a great way to to launch the story. It's a little less pat than say, uncle Scrooge ping to get them out of town at the beginning of dangerous to disguise.

184
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:10,307
Right. Yes. It's a nice little setup of them. We're arriving, and

185
00:22:10,725 --> 00:22:12,622
we see that the local

186
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:21,776
are kept to this stamped collecting business and Derek splitting and for all it's worth. They meet a woman, and she says c

187
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:26,886
I have trump big trunk attic. You pay one dollar you can see, and

188
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:50,573
This is five stamp collectors. We got from this week Pedro. You know, they they literally keep it it seems like everybody in the whole that whole part of South America is keeping a trunk of old letters just to exploit the Magenta app people. Yeah. That's right. I I like the sequence it feels very Barks to me. Right. The like, the people in the quote

189
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:51,412
sophisticated

190
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,885
country are getting a leg up. Oh, yeah.

191
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,105
Yeah. That's generally...

192
00:22:57,445 --> 00:23:05,159
Yes. For the time period that's generally what the smarter writers tended to do. The so called ignorant foreigner are actually smarter than the Americans.

193
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,854
Know, Right. And we've definitely got a little bit of the stereotype or the true

194
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:12,009
of the like lazy

195
00:23:12,945 --> 00:23:13,924
latin Americans,

196
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:14,802
but

197
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,583
but but in general, you know, the this This will be one of the kind depictions.

198
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,894
Part the story. No Al.

199
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:23,891
Right.

200
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:35,380
Yeah. I I like this sequence here in Gi. It... At the time, this was British Kia is now it is now heavily independent for for the these folks.

201
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,299
They have an encounter on the next page with a... What turns out to be a stamp collector from Boston.

202
00:23:42,855 --> 00:24:00,744
They they mistake it for a potential bo constrict ripple through this trunk of old letters This is the part that I remember the most from that Murray story you remembered. I think they were doing the same behind for be. Yeah. Yeah. The same kind of tour of people's attic And after,

203
00:24:01,402 --> 00:24:13,173
you know, many houses of this, we... Barks gives us the idea that the docks are getting very weary and the Nephews have a great way of summing it up. They say, yeah, we're quote taking a sort of Cook tour of the Georgetown

204
00:24:13,511 --> 00:24:13,830
attic.

205
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:18,192
At one dollar per attic. That's a great turn of phrase. To mean.

206
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:25,844
And this page closes out with Donald getting a a supposed bright idea saying that he wants to look at the

207
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:40,579
the mail records for eighteen fifty six. You're right. We we did get into the year of the the stamp. Yeah. I never actually said the full title of the stamp did. No. It is the the British kia

208
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:41,896
one cent

209
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:42,709
Shen,

210
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:47,260
which is which is of course, officially the world's rarest

211
00:24:47,598 --> 00:24:57,265
stamp take us to that next page and his visit to the post office. Yes. Visit to the post office is quite cynical. We're tipped off

212
00:24:57,565 --> 00:25:37,075
by the signer there. Yes, we have no magenta stamps. A little turn on yes, we have no banana hand. Yeah. Yes. And there's already seventeen stamp collectors ahead of Donald request. And he just leaves and discussed. And this the story takes another turn when they see when the nephews, see old man and get hit by his speed mode and fall to pi water, and there's more of that junior wood check ingenuity that can't go in to get save of them. So they throw castor oil. Well that just happens to be there to make the old man on the Applicants and Ast oil, what a great old time trope? Your you're a fan of the the classic

213
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:38,751
animated cartoons.

214
00:25:39,169 --> 00:26:07,833
Yeah. This this isn't in like in seems like it's in every fifth cartoon of a certain of a certain time. Yeah. Any anything involving small children, it'll will be there. Especially and especially with some of the r game two realtors to. Yes. This is it's a nice supposed segue that actually is moving the story forward because this old man is gonna give them the tip they need. Yeah. That's right. And and so they do save him by giving him the castor oil, make him una

215
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,247
to the per brianna.

216
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:17,696
Per of course. I hate to disappoint people who imagine that per brianna, like, quick and are an actual

217
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:47,388
danger but but, apparently, it's it's a bit of an urban myth. They're not really gonna gonna, like, eat you down to the bone in in moments. Like they might bite you, but that this old man would survived. Mh. And so, you know, he asks them. He tells them how grateful he is, ask if there's anything he can do for them and and the nephews... One of the nephews kind flip says, hey, maybe you can help us. We're looking for a one cent magenta stamp of eighteen fifty six, and

218
00:26:47,726 --> 00:26:58,462
we get this nice little po moment with him where he is like, reflecting how that... That's kind of a running joke around here, but but in my case, I actually

219
00:26:58,881 --> 00:27:04,635
do know I don't know where one is, but I do know who has one.

220
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:20,691
And and he tells them that it's in the hands of El dorado, the guild man. And I think we kinda gloss over that On on the way over, the Inducks were reading like a travel log that explained a little bit about the legend.

221
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:33,180
Of El dorado, but this is widely known. Right? Like... Yeah. This is this is Al legend that even today, a lot of people are still familiar with. Yes. It's a little bit of Carl for foreshadowing there.

222
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:40,794
When they're reading about it in passing. And we get the explanation from the old man that it was his father

223
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:57,405
who who originally had the letter with the stamp. He was a male carrier, and he got robbed to by a band of strange indians and carried and he was carried away to the jungle. He managed to get away but El dorado kept it. And nobody... And nobody believes him, unfortunately.

224
00:27:58,105 --> 00:28:07,724
Just seems to be another tall tell, but the Ducktales this as an upper community, know, Yeah. This the this is their reality at play. They're gonna help this old man

225
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:35,258
prove his prove his father was telling the truth and they're also gonna get rich. Too. Yeah. That's right. It's very convenient. This this old man this old river man is is like a a very sad part of the story. Right? Because he's been, like, spent his whole life basically trying to prove his father's story. I like that element sad where, like you said, you know, Bark keeps, like, four foreshadowing things. We get this reference to the silver Ducktales

226
00:28:35,418 --> 00:28:44,163
and the mail tab. Yes. It's the silver Ducktales. Yep. Yeah. That fascinated El dorado. So as you said, you know, they cut a deal with him and

227
00:28:44,702 --> 00:28:48,895
they go off in his instead. A charter a helicopter.

228
00:28:49,555 --> 00:28:52,775
Where were to assume that they're gonna use his tips

229
00:28:53,075 --> 00:28:55,775
to to kinda locate the last

230
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:01,470
spot. The little the last known siding. And I like fat that on this couple of pages

231
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:07,638
over the helicopter with with the helicopter, ride, we get this kind of, like theme of development

232
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:12,820
that Barb likes to touch on talking about how much the area been developed. Yeah.

233
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:19,380
Because at this point, they're in like the Savannah, which is which would have been jungle Barks when his...

234
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,428
The river man had his one and only siding of.

235
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:30,765
Yeah. These are just more dicks of how pushy things have gotten, but the world still has uncharted territory,

236
00:29:31,223 --> 00:29:33,639
The Inducks are going back into danger

237
00:29:34,097 --> 00:29:51,600
once again, the dangerous jungle where it's so fit where it's so thick. Even dinosaur could live here and Severino seen Donald says. It's kind of funny this on the... And the last two panels of this page is almost something... It should be terrifying, but it's almost comic cold but too

238
00:29:52,217 --> 00:29:56,045
because then nephews user saying, well, you you don't notice the jaguar that's about to jump up

239
00:29:57,425 --> 00:29:57,925
it's...

240
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:19,955
But the boat constrict got him first. Our old. There's a there's always a bigger fish that. I I like that you you highlighted what Donald says how there could be, you know, something that that's a common theme of Barks. Right? I and that's something that always fired my imagination as I was a kid, the idea that, like, there were still things to discover. Mh.

241
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,150
Even in the modern era of the nineteen fifties.

242
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,610
Yeah. You know, there were still these really thick junk.

243
00:30:28,303 --> 00:30:37,750
Tell us just take us through the rest of this jungle sequence because it's kinda of brief and bliss surprisingly. It is brief and brisk, and I think it's because

244
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:47,201
Bark new and his head that he had visited territory like this before. And he has more interesting stuff to get into. So he just wants to establish

245
00:30:47,634 --> 00:30:49,829
the kind of danger the Ducktales going through.

246
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:54,838
Donald thinks his skin is wiggling from the cr, but it's actually Al Ant,

247
00:30:55,336 --> 00:30:59,518
and they still haven't reached anything for days. And

248
00:31:00,014 --> 00:31:00,953
all of a sudden,

249
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,543
it's kind of... It's a bit of an adult reference

250
00:31:04,255 --> 00:31:06,795
Dewey we got a monkey on us back, literally.

251
00:31:07,855 --> 00:31:20,562
And do it just does not seem prepared by it at all because it's just Like he says it's tame as a kitten because compared Al the other danger they've been through who cares if this monkey sitting on me. But donald on wig out

252
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,914
a came monk you mean somebody

253
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:31,662
lives around there. So he gets the bright idea to shoot the monkey off and they're gonna follow them wherever he goes. Yeah. It's interesting that Barks gave Donald

254
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,397
that, you know,

255
00:31:34,235 --> 00:31:39,485
realization. Yes. He would normally do that for the Nephews, but they're kind of just exhausted.

256
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:44,005
Yeah. He's not really interested in this... It's a cool sequence.

257
00:31:44,379 --> 00:32:18,188
I like it. But it's it's not like you said it's not the story that he wants to tell. So, yeah. Go go ahead. Can take us take us up to the temple. Yes. So the... So they show the monkey away and they follow them. All of a sudden it's a quick journey because they're able to they have a lead finally. And, yeah, they get to the temple and if they think it's a deserted mining room and they don't see anything but monkeys the the the inhabitants aren't actually there yet. And they take a look inside and that one says it's kind of a museum

258
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:25,670
and they see all sorts of things that Al dorado and his men have taken from various explorers over the centuries

259
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:26,605
And

260
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:34,900
we get into one of the more well known sequences of Medic Huey, and Barks stuff. Oh, yeah. This didn't happen very often.

261
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,060
One of the nephews gets terrified

262
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,360
by something and yeah. Stuff docks.

263
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:53,160
This is pretty weird. Right? It's it's a little off putting. It's a little off porting. If you immediately reminds me of a cartoon that Jack Hannah Carl Barks old collaborator Al the Disney Studio had done...

264
00:32:53,697 --> 00:33:04,565
They've been in theaters maybe a year or so before Barks wrote the stories the lying around. And Donald said his... And Donald Ga is getting pursued by a lying and he poses as a Ducktales,

265
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:34,730
to right. I don't wonder if Carl, you know, he he didn't go to the movies a lot, but I he saw that I think he saw ja and he said hey that's a good gag jack came up with and... Yeah. You gotta assume he'd keep tabs on what they were up to a little bit, little old studio. Little ben. He was pretty isolated as a creator, but I I don't think he was above that, especially with people you worked with before. Helena? I want a backtrack just a bit to their arrival at that temple. I I love the pacing.

266
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:43,001
Yeah. So much. On on that one that rhythm of donald like emerging through the jungle growth and seeing u

267
00:33:43,378 --> 00:33:48,965
a paved path then he just looks up slightly and they see a o again

268
00:33:49,785 --> 00:33:54,885
temple. It's really fore bow. It's really imposing looking. It's very

269
00:33:55,199 --> 00:34:01,158
spooky. Yes. And this... Yes. The staging is some of his best. It's very for forgotten. It's like this is empty.

270
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:10,415
This doesn't feel right. We better do what we came here to do right away. Yeah. It really feels very. I remember this feeling very un unsettling.

271
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:15,005
He really shifts gears masterfully to make this whole

272
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:15,845
sequence

273
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:25,754
very creepy. I feel like he's there than anything in the jungle. Yeah. It's true. I'd like the the camera has this... The the camera. That we know.

274
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:31,180
Yeah. Yeah. The the purse effective through most of it is so low to the ground.

275
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,740
And it's just... It's gonna pay off when we get to.

276
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,780
To the big payoff.

277
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:42,793
Here, I'll I'll let you do that pay. I'll just... I'll just mention that, you know, they they do continue

278
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:51,160
to look for for what they're pursuing. And then they find it. They find the mail sack. It's got its own room

279
00:34:51,580 --> 00:35:24,260
which they kind of ascertain retain it. It It's because it's it's it's in a place of honor because it's the only silver item. Mh. And and so tell us about the sequence where he opens it. Yes. The... Yeah. Donald this two Craze to realize what his nephews do that this has been too easy. Found the stamp Al last yelling and, the fifty thousand dollar beauty and they're not... They have no reaction other than other horror something above donald and, hey, the scams here, what the dickens are you kids staring at? And

280
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:35,549
big reveal that takes up about three eighths of the page, El dorado himself. Yeah. It's it's a great reveal. It's it's gotta be one of Barks best, like, page.

281
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:42,427
In in any of his stories, The way that the like you mentioned it, the way that that panel

282
00:35:44,317 --> 00:35:52,891
stages is the reveal makes him so imposing. El silverado himself looks spectacular Right? Like, he's this weird

283
00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:54,886
mismatch of of native

284
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,500
tropes with the bone through his nose and and,

285
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,715
you know, I don't think it looks like any Indian in that area would have. So

286
00:36:04,213 --> 00:36:10,811
Like that's a criticism you could level. But I don't think there's any denying that he looks in imposing. He looks

287
00:36:11,228 --> 00:36:17,186
terrifying on his very detailed and art drawn. I guess he's human is need that. Yes.

288
00:36:17,944 --> 00:36:35,062
Yeah. So we don't get We don't get an explanation how he's existed this long. Yeah. It's weird. Bark is totally interested. Like we never really question as he like, long lived is he immortal. Is there like a a chain of Dorado and it's hereditary?

289
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:35,761
Right.

290
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:42,008
He's not interested in that. He is interested in having him be this totally imposing.

291
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:56,985
Terrifying figure. Right. So So on the next page, you know, Donald been caught he has this, like, half hard attempt to... She says pardon. We we thought you were out of town. Tremble. Yeah And we get... So El dorado

292
00:36:57,285 --> 00:36:57,785
commands

293
00:36:58,165 --> 00:37:06,880
that his, like men sees him. We get this, like, kinda trope that bark really light. Right? This, like, native lingo

294
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,280
that sounds

295
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:33,718
quote native, but also has like an English pun. I don't think it's aged that well, but it's not probably not the biggest sin of of these stories. It's it's It is what it is. It was it was a it was a common trope of the day. Right. And they sort of go... Do away with that a lot... If he does away with the elect with what he likes What he really likes to do is show what the translation really is and have them talk

296
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:36,510
Right. The basic English and sometimes

297
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,396
distorted English too, you know, just as any

298
00:37:39,932 --> 00:37:46,031
street wise tough would. Tomorrow these runs would dare touch my price silver metals. Al get the royal works.

299
00:37:46,645 --> 00:38:10,265
Right. So we we get some motivation for El dorado. We don't get to know him very well or or very long, but we do know what this character is all about. So so the docks get tossed down into this like dungeon that crucially is is below ground. Right? And they're just left to kind of faster and talk about the situation what happened. And they're are kind of

300
00:38:10,565 --> 00:38:21,645
recollection what the old river man told them how El dorado is nutty about silver. Mh. And that's that's gonna segue way into the Inducks Brainstorm.

301
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:30,165
Yes. And that's why the Nephews hit the force site. It gets a bottle of silver pain at a dine store because they they predicted that

302
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:36,539
this might be able to help them at some point if if Al dorado was that nutty about silver.

303
00:38:36,977 --> 00:38:54,330
I've gotta say I I respect sparks that sometimes he's like I don't need to do the building block for this. I don't need to have two panels that shows the kids. At the Die store. Right? He can... He... He's in a a good enough story. We know that they're resourceful.

304
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:04,795
So he can just allude to it. It works for me. Right. And it works because the nephews only had the idea to bring it. They have no idea how it's gonna get them out of trump.

305
00:39:05,607 --> 00:39:11,628
Just have this option, and now they have to really say Of course, Donald is the big one who gets punished first.

306
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:14,082
Right he's hold out of the dungeon.

307
00:39:14,514 --> 00:39:21,365
And the nephews figure out that El must weigh a ton if he's covered in gold dust. And of course,

308
00:39:22,178 --> 00:39:31,240
being junior wood shots, they know that something's gotta be holding them up and they see that the pillar is what's exactly holding them up. Right.

309
00:39:32,132 --> 00:39:40,018
So we we get this nice sequence on that next page where they're pondering what what was that we thought he'd weigh two tons.

310
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:51,460
I love the Nephews really determined look. Let's see as they start shipping away with their trust junior with Chuck and knives, I assume And the predictable happens, you know,

311
00:39:52,297 --> 00:39:55,150
El dorado is in the middle of some sort of punishment

312
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,200
ceremony.

313
00:39:57,739 --> 00:40:10,825
Right. He pave in through the floor the... We we get a little a little bit where the other natives are concern that the gods must be angry. It's a little eye and it's not it's not a big deal. Right.

314
00:40:12,025 --> 00:40:16,540
And so he lands in a days sheep. I love a.

315
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:28,270
That's a great expression like he's all of a sudden, this guy is no longer here. He's a typical Goo, you know, not cool. Yeah. I like that because he, like, starts out so

316
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:44,331
imposing. Mh. And then Barks really inflate him. Right. And and so they get the great idea the natural idea the thing to do with the man who's a the golden man who's obsessed with silver is of course to paint him. And

317
00:40:44,668 --> 00:40:45,965
eventually, he's gonna.

318
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,717
Yes and he emerges

319
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,650
and

320
00:40:49,028 --> 00:41:00,685
everyone is beside themselves. You no longer gold, you silver, Inducks what Great magic. And I I think this is where I I think this sort of reveals that Barks didn't really take these tropes to seriously

321
00:41:01,063 --> 00:41:05,828
because now he's making my typical American fashion obsessed first and by going. Oh,

322
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:07,247
brother

323
00:41:08,225 --> 00:41:12,700
Yeah. Looking at his new silver look, and the duct hike got out of there,

324
00:41:13,275 --> 00:41:13,775
And

325
00:41:14,195 --> 00:41:19,635
one of the nephews has four... More foresight sight, and they need something to help their case.

326
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:25,091
I I like this reveal too. They found the mail sick and they meet the old man who's

327
00:41:25,627 --> 00:41:33,736
ecstatic and they reveal. Yep. And if anybody still got your father's story, here's a spare pair of Al dorado pants to help you win the hassle.

328
00:41:34,374 --> 00:41:34,874
And

329
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:53,175
I like that. And it's right. Well, what's great is is that this story is nowhere near over. I mean, they've they're promised the stamp. But there's still... There's still what like, another nine pages left of the story. Right. There's essentially a ten pager worth of material left.

330
00:41:53,910 --> 00:42:03,463
Exactly. This is this is what makes this one stand out to me is that the climax acts is not where you think it is. This is nowhere near over

331
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:12,101
but it it doesn't feel short at all. It's very brisk, you know, and you said Barks had other places you wanted to take docs.

332
00:42:12,638 --> 00:42:15,807
And this is exactly where he is is taking them.

333
00:42:16,383 --> 00:42:21,055
That's this it's kind of con try, but it also isn't, but it's also logical.

334
00:42:21,435 --> 00:42:29,669
Donald taking this nail set and he gets are acc by a dart, and you can't leave the country with the sec of his majesty mail.

335
00:42:30,426 --> 00:42:41,325
And it's like, no. It's still has to be delivered even if it is ninety six years late. This this next sequence is is great. How is it that that this

336
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,220
sequence

337
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,100
feels

338
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,075
more suspense. Right? Sure I mess mail sack back to

339
00:42:49,813 --> 00:42:53,226
back to the Us is gonna feel more successful than tray

340
00:42:53,763 --> 00:42:56,817
more suspense than tracing through the jungle

341
00:42:57,289 --> 00:43:00,083
and entering that forbid temple.

342
00:43:00,442 --> 00:43:05,630
I don't know how he does it, but but it's it's fantastic. And again, that's what makes this one unique.

343
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:12,241
The the real danger and interior is not where you think it's gonna be. Right. Absolutely.

344
00:43:12,816 --> 00:43:20,232
So I love... I like that that kinda little bit of conscience comes into play again here where, like, these

345
00:43:20,945 --> 00:43:22,125
these her majesty

346
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:26,925
mail folks have to do their duty, but they... They're like

347
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:29,525
understanding when they realize the Donald

348
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:40,035
is tracking this magenta to stamps so like, oh man, we gotta cut this guy a break after what he seems to have been through. And so they they at least give him the last known

349
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,035
address or the the next

350
00:43:42,335 --> 00:43:44,075
address and it's destined

351
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:46,650
to miss Susie Bell swan,

352
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:49,330
sixty Hon Street in Mud,

353
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:50,810
Ohio

354
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,210
in the Usa.

355
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,225
Mh. And thus

356
00:43:54,685 --> 00:44:00,845
starts this great sequence where they're gonna trace through some of these, like, very Barks

357
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:01,945
locals towels.

358
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:04,356
Why don't you tell us about

359
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:16,420
the that first stop? Yes. They go and no. No miss Susie Ba one lives at that address. She left in eighteen eighty. Gave a forwarding address of ten q Road web foot oregon,

360
00:44:16,837 --> 00:44:21,476
and of course Barks was born and oregon gone, so that's a little out of a thing. Yeah.

361
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:26,483
You as the distance status? Like, what what was she do that you moved

362
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:30,050
completely across the country, almost from Coast to coast?

363
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,085
Especially.

364
00:44:31,745 --> 00:44:47,985
Actually that exactly. And this way, this is this becomes a domestic suspense story. Plus this is also showing that Donald actually is a good person. He... He doesn't have to do any of this. I mean, he could just skip with it, but

365
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,623
Just try him.

366
00:44:50,320 --> 00:45:05,233
But, yes. See we've established that donald as an outstanding character in the story. Right for this one. At least for this one, I I love the webb foot. Yeah. The the... I love the Barks lu his, like, weather afflicted

367
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:09,361
towns. Right? Whether it's like, flood out Ohio

368
00:45:10,259 --> 00:45:28,520
and tear of the river that's in perpetual flood or what is it point marrow and frozen gold that's always being covered by snow. This is And so eventually, they are able to track it to to her where she floated away in nineteen o one, Her forwarding

369
00:45:28,897 --> 00:45:32,605
address is forty five Mall Avenue Inducks

370
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:33,440
bird,

371
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,100
Al.

372
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:45,535
So this is pretty significant. Right? That. You wanna tell us about it? Yes. Isn't this the first time, they actually named the state, quote unquote state that duck berg

373
00:45:46,115 --> 00:45:54,227
Yeah. And and I believe that it's the first and only time that Barks uses the the, like, a ama of California

374
00:45:54,725 --> 00:45:55,764
and Minnesota.

375
00:45:56,163 --> 00:45:58,521
To to refer to this fictional Al

376
00:45:59,254 --> 00:46:21,225
stay. I'll defer to what... I'll defer to what you say there because it's so ingrained into my head as Right because so many Yeah. So many Disney comics creators have used it it just... It just feels right. Right. And and and it kinda matches, you know, where Barks sets these stories so many of his stories are gonna be are gonna take place at a California Beach.

377
00:46:21,565 --> 00:46:39,480
But then he's gonna have his winter, Minnesota like stories. So it works. So when they track when they continue to track the story, the trail runs cold because there is now a factory of the tool factory in it's place. And so they have to go back to the post office.

378
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:40,719
And

379
00:46:41,138 --> 00:46:46,361
this is a great sequence. This is one of the ultimate you love to hate him

380
00:46:46,697 --> 00:47:01,920
moments in in Glad gander history because the duck arrive at the post office at the same moment that their cousin Gladstone does. Right. And tell us about what happens. Well, this is a beautifully stage sequence.

381
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:11,735
No for you today, Gladstone, but there's a letter here. See you're late this it rather of miss Susie Belt swan. I believe she made you her so air.

382
00:47:13,195 --> 00:47:19,186
And there's a brilliant it's the fourth panel on this page. No. No. No. He dials

383
00:47:19,525 --> 00:47:22,382
faint thing. Donald is just he's just

384
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:28,855
destroyed by wes. He... He's been able to see this. As soon as he saw Gladstone,

385
00:47:28,895 --> 00:47:30,515
you sense that he knows

386
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,690
what about to happen.

387
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:33,890
Mh. And

388
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,250
nephew you shoot them away with violence.

389
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,310
I'll wrap this waste basket around your ears.

390
00:47:39,845 --> 00:47:41,285
A great turn phrase.

391
00:47:42,085 --> 00:47:45,184
Barks did that kind of thing like every issue.

392
00:47:45,525 --> 00:47:56,785
Right. And he... And Donald still holding up hope that Gladstone too stupid bed, he'll just think it's old and toss away because he doesn't know anything really about the stamps. But that's

393
00:47:57,323 --> 00:48:06,009
That's counting... That's not counting on the Gladstone look like he should. Yeah. I know. This seems like the triumph of hope over experience.

394
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,509
Mh.

395
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:08,089
Because

396
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:13,690
Glad stone does kind of notice that stamp seems a little bit odd.

397
00:48:14,084 --> 00:48:15,024
Yeah. And

398
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:25,781
and the docks follow him into a very familiar house on millionaire row. Yeah yep. And Donald knows the deal. He's like, we can finally rest because

399
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:33,639
I Haven't really highlighted this, but, like... This has been such a great journey. Right? They the deduct have been in motion.

400
00:48:34,516 --> 00:48:37,172
So much that we sense that they're just utterly

401
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,306
exhausted physically and mentally.

402
00:48:39,745 --> 00:48:41,279
Yes. And Gladstone

403
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,059
bursts out two minutes later with a lot of cash

404
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,099
telling them that

405
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,466
he just sold a stamp for fifty thousand dollars

406
00:48:51,803 --> 00:49:11,218
and as an aside, hey, didn't you just go to South America to find a stamp? Did you have he luck and the the look of murder that the four du give him, Definitely a stand panel for me in this one. Yes. And the very next one is too it's just like, ink talking and hey. Jealous and my fifty grand.

407
00:49:12,632 --> 00:49:16,099
Did they're holding back everything to not kill him.

408
00:49:16,399 --> 00:49:42,244
Yeah. It's like, come around sometime because and I'll tell you how to make money from the stick bracket. And balance You Donald tell them. Alright. Come on. We can stand anything, but I'm gonna walk home alone. And every ten feet, I'm gonna stop and have a tantrum because, you know, that's the you know, the bait and switch. You think he's over it. But no. He's... No. He's not. He's donald Ducktales gonna flip out. I I love love love love that panel that how he just launched

409
00:49:42,704 --> 00:49:56,299
himself and first into a brick wall, I think that might be my favorite panel of the story. It might be mike too. I I I I kinda I quote... I actually quote that quite a bit. I'm gonna go through. I'm got every ten.

410
00:49:57,934 --> 00:50:08,027
It's so evo. Yes. And like like you said, it's... He does such a great job. He has such a level demeanor until that moment. Right. Ahead. And feel caleb

411
00:50:08,486 --> 00:50:10,185
is... He's in a super.

412
00:50:10,724 --> 00:50:16,872
You know, he's going to... He's going to go to San Francisco code and exhibit this stamp bought for mister Gold.

413
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:37,262
He's running off and, you know, as he's running, this is more of Barks as brilliant pace taste, and it's hilarious to forgetting as he's going along which city he's actually going to? Right. By the end of the page, he's going to Boston this time. Yeah. He's he's forgotten his hat. But he says, oh, it's fine. I'll put a new one in boston.

414
00:50:37,678 --> 00:50:40,940
He's like, forgetting in real time. Alright. And

415
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:46,773
just happens to Past Donald who's just shedding his bitter tears over a dark river

416
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:48,251
and he

417
00:50:48,805 --> 00:50:50,425
F is right behind him.

418
00:50:50,845 --> 00:51:21,744
Mean you thinks he's gonna take a train to Saint Louis or fly and no. It's a trade. And why am I running? That's it's this... You can't help and love this guy. Oh, I do. And he has a taxi but. This is one time where his forgetful is really gonna do him in. He forgets the stamp Al with the Magenta stamp. And who happens to find it donald. That's right. Yeah. He is right next to it. This is a bit of the Gladstone luck somehow. Yeah transferring to him but

419
00:51:22,081 --> 00:51:34,399
but it's like noble. Right? Because I I sense that Donald would have like, really appreciate selling that magenta to stamp to him. For what it was. And and he he is... He instantly

420
00:51:34,817 --> 00:51:37,011
realizes is it's it's violet Al

421
00:51:38,143 --> 00:51:51,586
and he wants to get it back to him. You don't hear him. His internal monologue is not recognizing for a reward even in this one. So really what he just went through to get that stamp. He's not looking it get lost.

422
00:51:51,924 --> 00:51:52,003
Yeah.

423
00:51:52,801 --> 00:51:53,280
Exactly.

424
00:51:53,614 --> 00:52:11,259
And and he so determines to do it. He he arrives at the train station. Thinking I'm gonna take a chance He's probably going to exhibit it in some city. So he hawk his wrist watch, which gets him a ticket on the trade to Chicago but only as far as the Duck City limits.

425
00:52:11,757 --> 00:52:14,092
Right. And then we transition

426
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:18,017
back to F who is Barks skiing in his recent

427
00:52:18,475 --> 00:52:18,975
acquisition.

428
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:29,287
I I gotta read his dialogue here because that's just so it's such a perfect gag He says, I'm aboard the train on my way to San francisco.

429
00:52:30,024 --> 00:52:38,109
It's a wonder. I didn't become excited and forget something. But My magenta stamp here would make anyone excited.

430
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:52,385
And he and he realizes, of course that he has forgotten it. Yes. And this is the one thing he does remember Bur he remembers exactly where he left it. Right. This train won't stop reaches San Francisco. And donald forbes...

431
00:52:52,763 --> 00:52:58,151
This is the strangest of chicago. And I I love that panel where he he Gladstone

432
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:00,581
my old friend grind

433
00:53:01,398 --> 00:53:01,757
gimmick.

434
00:53:03,114 --> 00:53:05,210
It's just it's just such a great little

435
00:53:05,588 --> 00:53:27,364
character be because you know, got donald done the right thing. And he said, he's about to get like, he should have had coming down. But I don't actually see it. It's just little it's just little ending with the Nephews on the phone. You know, donald... That's not down on these out Al the city limits. You have you got money for carb you got money for camp home. Oh, I'm got fifty grand, I guess I can make it.

436
00:53:28,502 --> 00:53:39,859
I I think I think we sort of summed up going through a page by page market. It's mainly me realize what makes this one so special because it really takes the deduct and places.

437
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:57,466
You're not predicting where the story is going at any point. It's... You know, there's little past issues, you know, we mentioned it's a little similar to luck of the north where Gladstone stones driven the whole adventure in some way. Yeah. And we've we've seen, you know, the jungle journeys before many times.

438
00:53:58,085 --> 00:54:03,874
But we you've got this wrap. And you also mentioned that it has a bit of a ten page flavor story.

439
00:54:04,373 --> 00:54:25,020
I think in this case, unlike with big t top bed, what you just did, which is just a ten page story and the thirty two pages is This one just has more of the intricacies of a ten pager which wide... Which is why it has that flavor. I mean, big top is just Carl Barks having fun going nuts with how long. Can I make this go? But

440
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:26,336
this one,

441
00:54:26,673 --> 00:54:37,765
no. He knows how long he wants it and where he wants to take these docks. Yeah. There's a lot of confidence in his storytelling with this one. Right? Because, like, in this thirty two page comic, we

442
00:54:38,384 --> 00:54:41,779
We spend a lot of time in in many different places.

443
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:48,949
Always on the move always in motion. I think that's why this one might get brushed off a little.

444
00:54:50,029 --> 00:54:51,249
It doesn't have

445
00:54:51,910 --> 00:55:00,249
one it doesn't have one journey in mind. You know, like the golden helmet has that one goal in mind throughout the whole thing. Right. But

446
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:04,249
I've I've always loved this. I love it ever since I first read it.

447
00:55:04,749 --> 00:55:24,033
I don't... I I don't know if it's my time favorite, but it's like, you don't wanna spare because it's really really, really great. Oh, yeah. It might not just be as famous as as some of the other stories. Yeah. I I feel like this is in kind of the the very top of the second tier if that makes sense. Maybe

448
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:25,164
maybe it's

449
00:55:25,903 --> 00:55:46,001
You know, I've sometimes, like, will sum up different films and directors, etcetera. You know, that there... There is some overlap in the first to your territory. But for some reason, it... I can't articulate why though because there's nothing wrong with this story. There's nothing that feels bed or con t or holt,

450
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:53,439
you know, or, you know, well Carl was just filling in this, you know, Carlos was just filling in pages here. This... No it It's

451
00:55:53,777 --> 00:55:55,355
atmospheric, it moves brisk.

452
00:55:55,733 --> 00:56:01,381
It's really funny. And oh... Yeah. It has suspense where you don't expect systems?

453
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:07,655
I I think we covered it pretty well. Yeah. I agree. I I think this one's extremely suspense.

454
00:56:08,855 --> 00:56:16,149
Very funny like you said, one thing that stands out to me on this, like, as we've gone through it this time, it has some of the best

455
00:56:16,725 --> 00:56:17,225
expressive.

456
00:56:18,214 --> 00:56:19,391
I think of any...

457
00:56:19,808 --> 00:56:22,400
Any of Barks stories, the Ducktales

458
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:24,733
expressions, glad stones expressions

459
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:31,055
everyone's face is such a treat to look at. And I I would encourage people to really pay attention

460
00:56:31,514 --> 00:56:32,214
on their,

461
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:43,029
you know, read through listening to the podcast. To to look at look at those faces, and look at the expressive in this one. Well, this is about where he peek because

462
00:56:43,889 --> 00:56:58,474
as an artist because I haven't listened to your recent episodes, but this was around the time when Carl second marriage went south and he was doing out of his work out of a hotel room. And, you know, I think that fuel him

463
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,795
you know, sometimes angry, can be a

464
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:02,088
a great vehicle,

465
00:57:02,425 --> 00:57:06,892
and he did he drew and wrote some of his strongest new material ever,

466
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:10,800
and unlike, as you'll get in into next episodes,

467
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:15,155
where, you know, something like the western office censorship,

468
00:57:15,495 --> 00:57:16,375
beat them down,

469
00:57:17,175 --> 00:57:20,330
this sort of had a negative impact on his work

470
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:21,530
This

471
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,250
had had really

472
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:26,890
good effect on his work. I mean, this stuff is untouchable,

473
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:37,546
really, as far as the long adventures go. Yeah. And and it's such a unique structure. That that to me is part of what makes it special. That book str.

474
00:57:37,985 --> 00:57:41,649
Yes. So, you know, we've been talking about it, but let's let's

475
00:57:41,986 --> 00:57:49,876
see where the community chimes in. This one is very well like by the community. It's not quite in the conversation

476
00:57:50,293 --> 00:57:54,582
for, like, the all time great But if you take a look on

477
00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:03,910
index, you know, which is Of course, it's not the end all, but it's as good of a measure of the community sentiment we've got. It does generally

478
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:19,700
make the top twenty. Oh, no. That's pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. I was. That's why better than what I was thinking. No. When I when I looked and, of course, this is subject to change. It'll probably float here and there. Yeah. But never that much. When I looked, it was Al number nineteen.

479
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:20,640
U.

480
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:33,164
With an eight point two rating out of ten. So so very good. I I was curious too, and it it is... It is the highest rated story that features Gladstone gander.

481
00:58:34,002 --> 00:58:51,180
Even even out pace is luck of the north, which I think is about ten or so slots down. I I think I might like luck of the north a little bit more. It's it's definitely one of I'm more pivotal and important stories and Barks career. Yeah. Yeah. That that guilt sequence.

482
00:58:51,836 --> 00:59:01,488
Very little in his career Barks quite the punch. Mh. That that does. But but this, you know, it it definitely chimes in with that great suspense.

483
00:59:01,828 --> 00:59:06,636
I remember being genuinely creeped out the kid the first time. I read this one.

484
00:59:07,595 --> 00:59:29,751
So, yeah, Very well regarded as you mentioned, it's been rei imagined by other Disney artists, maybe not as successfully. Right. Don Rosa did do a follow to this one. He did a sql story called the last lord of El dorado. Haven't read that one in in years. There There's a there's a big gap in my

485
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:33,059
rose memory for various reasons, but

486
00:59:33,476 --> 00:59:36,289
I I just don't remember that one being particularly

487
00:59:36,746 --> 00:59:39,135
unique but maybe like this one, it's...

488
00:59:39,472 --> 00:59:44,160
An un gem to extend. Who knows. Yeah. I'll I'll have to revisit it.

489
00:59:44,617 --> 01:00:17,783
But but... You know, most of the roses is stories I can remember very, very well. That one I get I've read. I don't I don't remember that. And and then, you know, this one, he had had a pretty great oil for this one. A great painting that had the title stamp collectors bad moment and you know that one? Oh, yeah. The the the Barks being. Yes. Yeah. That's the great one. It's one of his best ones. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. It really has that. It really captures that eerie creepy sense. Right. That they got. I I saw it two that that painter

490
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:37,932
John Ga has done an a neat version of an un finished, like, concept he did for for the painting called Flynn guild Man which I think this worth taking a look at. And then that, are you a fan of the either a Ducktales series? I can't remember if we talked about this. I believe the fifth on that one.

491
01:00:39,184 --> 01:00:39,684
So

492
01:00:40,302 --> 01:00:40,802
definitely...

493
01:00:41,301 --> 01:00:47,885
I definitely have a soft spot for the original. You know, I was a bartender fan, but four. I... My my

494
01:00:48,422 --> 01:01:02,315
appreciation of the Barks comics dates Ducktales by roughly a year. So you know, as an eight year old nine year old, whatever. Oh, of course. Yeah that it did its job then. Yeah. That's what it did. And and I I think it's a lot of fun.

495
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:07,299
They never adopted this story specifically. But the

496
01:01:07,637 --> 01:01:09,015
the recent one

497
01:01:09,353 --> 01:01:26,587
which I have kinda mixed feelings. Yes. So that's the I believe the fifth time completely. Got the eighty seven Ducktales guess is good for whatever. Yeah. I I mean, I think that the recent one did some good stuff. There there are some aspects of it, I really like. But then there are some aspects of it that really

498
01:01:26,963 --> 01:01:27,640
puzzled me.

499
01:01:29,293 --> 01:01:34,368
And and the weird little, like, homage that they did in this one.

500
01:01:35,207 --> 01:01:43,293
From an episode called nothing can stop del doc. They have, like, El dorado appear, but as like a mecca as like a robot.

501
01:01:44,412 --> 01:01:49,525
And it's weird. It doesn't bear much but I I don't I don't wanna gloss it. So duck

502
01:01:50,225 --> 01:01:51,805
covered the guild man.

503
01:01:52,585 --> 01:02:03,552
Yeah. So as far as what's dated or our K the magenta stamp is now worth... Let's see. I think I put this down somewhere. I hope I didn't

504
01:02:04,264 --> 01:02:29,828
excluded it. I wanna say it was like it's sold recently for, like, ten million dollars or something like that. But while I Google that, let me ask you that if if you have any favorite panels that come to mind that we didn't already cover, Gosh. I I can't think of it any we didn't cover already. But this it has so many that are burned in my brain that that kinda sending Al a of Gladstone,

505
01:02:30,387 --> 01:02:41,233
donald, stopping every ten feet tantrum. It's really the end of the story that I actually is standing at the most to me because it's just... You, it's just this incredible journey that's now ended,

506
01:02:41,651 --> 01:02:43,827
you know, Yeah. Supposedly so def.

507
01:02:44,539 --> 01:03:03,935
Which is why I I I guess it it I guess is why those panels are burnt into my add so much. Because this is where I it's like, well, wait. This isn't how it's gonna end. Is we make they just lose and this... Oh, I ironic a isn't it ending. No. These Barks is gonna make it the double I. Yeah. You didn't you didn't remember that

508
01:03:04,329 --> 01:03:14,393
Donald ended up with the money lights got the first time. He's gonna get it again. It actually fa me how memorable the parts that are not. The big jungle

509
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,083
temple adventure are in this story.

510
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,900
Like, they really stand out to me. And that there a ton of great panels. You know, the one where they enter the temple at first.

511
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:32,660
And it looks off forbid. That that one stands out to me, but but like I said, a lot of the just reaction shots

512
01:03:33,014 --> 01:03:36,027
are are really cool the Ducktales expressive

513
01:03:36,405 --> 01:03:48,564
really is what stands out to me in this one. Yeah. Any any other closing thoughts, anything that we didn't mention that you wanted to say about this one. Honestly, if you don't regard this as one of your favorites,

514
01:03:49,633 --> 01:03:57,480
reread it, I I I think you'll be surprised. It's... Like we've said, it's one that, you know, it's just an accepted classic, but

515
01:03:57,939 --> 01:04:23,530
you don't hear talk the lot or dissect a lot about. I guess because it has a lot more famous material surrounding it. You know, it was done in nineteen fifty two when Barks was doing a lot of his best work. But yes. Just... I I have nothing else to say about the guild man other than I don't think it's my fit... It's definitely not my Al time favorite story, but it would be in the top five of the long ventures for sure for me.

516
01:04:24,383 --> 01:04:27,594
That... That's fair. I I think it's very memorable.

517
01:04:28,012 --> 01:04:28,512
And

518
01:04:29,048 --> 01:05:01,230
I think you made some great points. You summed it up nicely. The only thing I'll add is this is up. Awesome story if you wanna introduce someone. Yeah. That's... Yes. And that's why Gladstone don't pick, but I story to print and the their first issue of donald doc. I'd right exactly why they picked it. Because because you're getting it all, you're getting his great art. You're getting his great adventure his a humor. You're getting everything with this story. And I don't think they wanted to pick this one too because they wanted to differentiate the characters

519
01:05:01,744 --> 01:05:05,316
you know, for the new audience that's getting introduced to these characters

520
01:05:05,733 --> 01:05:10,920
because Scrooge plays no part in the story at all. And it's a story around

521
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:20,084
money and greed a little bit, which is kind of surprising that Karl didn't include him. Room. But I you know, I think it's all the better for that because

522
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:23,312
Scrooge might have taken it into some predictable territory,

523
01:05:23,808 --> 01:05:24,308
but

524
01:05:24,819 --> 01:05:56,502
That's one thing you can put in this story favor. You do not see where it's going. Where hit. Oh, and I'm so glad we got to meet f t Al Yeah for this one. Yeah. I I would have welcomed having him. You know, I don't know how he could shoe horn another stamped story again, but it would have been great to see him. Coming back. Alright. Excellent.
