1
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,495

2
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:37,825

00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:54,850
publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome come back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever, a Grown man who enjoys dot com.

4
00:00:55,463 --> 00:01:05,104
And I Al joined by another grown man and returning guest host, Ryan Bailey. Ryan, if you could please introduce yourself

5
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:11,125
and remind... It's been a little while since you've been on. So remind us your connection to bark comics,

6
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:12,361
comics

7
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:13,852
in general.

8
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,002
Yeah. I'm Ryan, and I have

9
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:24,599
had essentially no connection to Barks comics except by knowing Barks. I just remember them on your books shelves, and

10
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:27,788
you and Eric talking about them sometimes, and then

11
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:51,255
doing some episodes at this podcast with you So this is essentially my first exposure was whatever our first episode was. That was... Let's see was that back with frozen gold. There was one before that, I think. Oh, yeah. The the mommy's ring. The money ring. That's it. Yeah. That's right. You and Eric have been Among my Barks newbies. Right? When I started the podcast, my idea was to

12
00:01:51,715 --> 00:02:20,024
introduce you guys to these and and I'd have on newbies and get that perspective. And, you know, Al time's gone on, real life gets in the way and so I had to mix it up with other bark, fans and and Barks, artists and writers, which has been really cool. But I really like getting to have newbies on and and get their feel for it. So this this is a very famous and very cool Barks story that we're gonna be talking about today. We get to talk about the secret

13
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:20,880
of

14
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:21,859
Lan,

15
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:27,938
which was first published way back in uncle Scrooge number five.

16
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:39,745
So, Ryan, it's been a while since I've had you. I think the last one you got to do is the stack Us spend three. Right? That sounds right. And and that was around the same time that

17
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:43,300
bark finally got, like, uncle Scrooge

18
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,720
spun off into his own title.

19
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:57,146
This is technically only the second numbered uncle Scrooge because they they counted his first three adventures that were actually published as, like, part of a four color series

20
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:11,340
as, like, officially uncle screwed one, two, and three. But but we're at the beginning of the series, and just to give you an idea of how important Barks was to Western Publishing. They did not publish this series

21
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:12,978
that these issues

22
00:03:13,557 --> 00:03:25,854
when they didn't have a Barks story. Like, he was the line for for dozens of... It was a long time before they, like, featured other artist. In it. Wow. That's something.

23
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:29,214
And and this is way back in January of nineteen

24
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:30,055
fifty

25
00:03:30,474 --> 00:03:32,294
four. This has been a really

26
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:43,717
fertile period for him, It's widely considered his golden age, probably at the very end of... I think what most sparks fans would consider as full niche. Huey, still got some really

27
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:55,857
classic stories yet to come. This one's been reprinted a pretty good number of times. It's had twelve including the original, but it is a longer story. Right? Thirty two cad,

28
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,150
which kinda limits.

29
00:03:57,843 --> 00:04:06,916
You know, the opportunities for reprint. Did you notice this was kind of long? I did. Yeah. Yeah. You were asking about my connection to Comics. I've read several thousand

30
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:08,209
Marble comics

31
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:10,126
over the last several years,

32
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:10,966
and

33
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:21,637
they're almost always twenty four pages. Everyone while you get a big a big deal, you know? Because it's spider man's seven hundred issue or whatever, and they'll have a long thing. But but

34
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:27,779
twenty four is what feels correct, you know? And it's like, like watching a three hour movie or something where you're like,

35
00:04:28,499 --> 00:04:33,974
this is starting to stretch out a little bit, you know, and this doesn't... This feels little long, but... Yeah. So

36
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:36,807
It it is a little weird to be a story this long.

37
00:04:37,584 --> 00:04:40,875
Yeah. I I think that's right. You know, Barks got to really

38
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:43,547
stretch his legs with this one. He had

39
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:52,870
plenty of space, there were only about ten or so where you got to go to that full thirty two page length. And there was just a single

40
00:04:53,663 --> 00:04:58,549
Well, there were two that were longer. His very first one, which was a weird adaptation

41
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:13,086
of a never made Disney short. Donald Duck finds pirate goal which was sixty four like, largely worthless less pages. Because was almost like an animation story board and then there was a very special one that right

42
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:22,856
they had Al extra splash page for thirty three pages. But this is in fact the very last thirty two page or that he's ever gonna get to do.

43
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:31,344
There will be one more thirty one pager. And then for the most part, they are gonna land around that, like, twenty four page ish length that you mentioned.

44
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:32,404
It's...

45
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:38,098
One thing that's striking to me is that it's such a significant issue. It's you know, it's long.

46
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:45,201
It's one of the first ones Scrooge series, as you mentioned, and my copy here does not have a title.

47
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:55,789
It... In fact, it doesn't even have an issue number. It just says walt Disney on Scrooge, and it has the months and that's it. You you're setting this up, like perfectly

48
00:05:56,126 --> 00:06:08,685
for me to do the layout or whatever. Like, because it it's it is a little odd. Right? The cover is a gag cover. It doesn't have a cover that's even connect to the story. And and it was un title And

49
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:10,817
as part of my trivia,

50
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:18,396
there there was a Al letter that Barks exchanged with a fan in the seventy Dine named Malcolm Will.

51
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:32,078
And and will it's ask Barks to please come up with some proposed titles for some of his very famous early adventure stories that for some reason Western Publishing. Didn't do a title for. And Barks

52
00:06:32,078 --> 00:06:37,523
you know, he suggested for this one, the title of the Sunken City which

53
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,594
is is actually how glad stone

54
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:41,431
presented

55
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:43,483
presented it in the late eighties.

56
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:57,404
And so the first the first time I read it, that's how I read it. And I for one think that's a much better title? Because I think it it gives you a little more impact to kinda bury the lead and not reveal that that it is.

57
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:03,114
Yeah. Let's see a little bit of cool trivia for you, Ryan. This issue

58
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:05,594
is the first ever reference.

59
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:26,549
To the junior wood chuck guide. Really? Yeah. Now when we get to it, we'll highlight the fact that it doesn't have its final name. It'll be the very next issue where he kinda lands on on what it's called. But when they consult their junior wood checks manual, that that is the first time that they do that. Sweet. Yeah. That's that feels like a very distinctive

60
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:31,190
we do and Louie thing to me. Exactly. It's it's definitely icon it.

61
00:07:31,963 --> 00:07:39,326
Another thing that's icon, although maybe not quite as much. Is is one of... I think Barks all time best gag

62
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,914
This is the first appearance of screws worry room. I love the worry room.

63
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:48,230
I I love the worry room too. Barks Sparks stands love it.

64
00:07:48,804 --> 00:07:51,901
It it's great. The little bit more background,

65
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,618
Barks mentioned in some other correspondence

66
00:07:54,997 --> 00:08:06,451
that he got the idea for this story. It it was actually provided to him by his editor at the time named Chase craig But his editor or presented it as a possible

67
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:20,499
ten page story. Barks is the one who took that and then really ran with. So I'm curious about that because that is the thing that really like, makes the story special to me. Right? Is that it starts out

68
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:31,649
has basically this great ten page po story. Were you taking the back at how it how it kinda takes that sharp term? Yeah. The progression is really astounding. That's

69
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:39,129
I mean, it's it it kinda feels like I feel like the very best, like Simpsons episodes or seinfeld failed episodes or whatever

70
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:54,732
or, like, it starts with some little thing, and then it progresses to this other weird thing, and then it takes an even weird turn after that and and pretty soon, you can barely remember the, like the, like, big sale at the beginning of the episode or whatever now that you're on the moon, fighting aliens or whatever and

71
00:08:55,309 --> 00:09:30,739
so this was a... Gave me... Gave me that kind of vibe of the Let's see how how far we can go from a to b. Yeah. I think that Simpson comparison is a good one. Yeah. I it... No one knows this for sure. But it is generally thought that he did start this as one of his ten page stories. And then just ran utterly ran. So that... That's kind of the significant famous thing about this story Let's see. We we're just gonna do a couple of the titles from around the world the for the most part, this one has a a pretty pedestrian direct

72
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:32,199
translation of the Secret.

73
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:36,074
Right? So in Spanish, it will be all separate right they have.

74
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:39,434
But I did give you a fun one

75
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:42,174
from Italy. So so what do we got?

76
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:44,008
I'm gonna say

77
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:49,660
which translates to uncle Scrooge

78
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:51,752
this guy really. Yeah.

79
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:54,506
For all I know, that sounded great.

80
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:55,844
Nice.

81
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:57,879
And then I picked Germany

82
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,449
where one of the most common

83
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:03,440
translations titles is der

84
00:10:05,612 --> 00:10:09,422
the lost ten. And and I'm just guessing that that's the

85
00:10:09,814 --> 00:10:16,814
and they picked for the... For the famous coin in this one that it's not a quarter, but a a ten Deutsche mark at the time.

86
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:20,209
So let's see. Ryan, do you have any thoughts

87
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:23,349
before we plow into the the content of this one?

88
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:27,178
This is also the first issue I've read that had

89
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:39,289
a little a little short at the beginning that was unrelated to the story. Yeah. You know, so I These were usually presented with a little one page gag at the beginning or at the end of the story,

90
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:43,539
depending on their length. Some of them might have had, like, a ten pager

91
00:10:43,997 --> 00:10:52,439
a ten page short if it was like, a thirty, you know, a twenty page adventure sport. They might have a little backup there. But what you think of the little one page I can't even remember what it was.

92
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,459
It was a hospitality week where

93
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:01,434
Scrooge just supposed to invite someone to dinner everyone in the Neighborhood is inviting someone over to dinner that week, and

94
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:04,789
he's afraid that a guest might eat up whole dollars worth of food.

95
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:15,760
And then in the in the last frame, he sees cast iron Charlie, eat old razor blades, broken glass, rusty nails, etcetera. And and screwed says, what you're doing this evening? It's it's good for, like,

96
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:37,757
breathing a little bit loudly through your mouth. Right? It's a my little chuckle. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, Barb, if you count up every story, every adventure story ten page or one page or etcetera. It's over five hundred. But a lot of those are the one pager. They're they're great. Right? But they are what they are. I'm not covering them in the podcast for obvious reasons.

97
00:11:38,715 --> 00:11:41,291
But I'm glad you mentioned it there because like, I literally

98
00:11:41,669 --> 00:12:06,824
have not referenced a single one of them in in the entirety of my podcast, so far. Yeah. No. I think it's... It reminds me of, like, the Sunday comments I used to read or whatever in the newspaper. Like, you get, you know, a little set you get a little payoff off at the end. Get a little a little choco. Right. They're they're exactly as funny as it's possible to be in a panels when you're doing this kinda broad. He sure is rich, com.

99
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:08,343
Yeah. Definitely.

100
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:09,382
So

101
00:12:09,721 --> 00:12:11,100
the secret of Al lan,

102
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,267
I prefer the sun City, but that is not the official title. Where we're going with secret of Atlanta.

103
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:24,904
As mentioned, it it starts out like it's one of Barks is most clever ten pager.

104
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:29,944
We've got a really classic splash panel of Scrooge looking through a ledger.

105
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:31,599
Pondering

106
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:56,059
rev the decking stool for dead bait beats that never pay their debts. And he's like, really thick stated on a no good well that has owed him ten cents easily dimes since nine fifty. So for four years now. It should be quoted out also while he's looking at this ledger. I can't see it a chair that he's sitting on. It appears. Just sitting on money. He's just sitting on a

107
00:12:56,477 --> 00:13:06,039
huge pile of money. Right. There's so much great signaling about his wealth on this page. He's lit... He's burning a candle instead of using lights.

108
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:09,074
He's got there's a great site gag bills

109
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:14,022
in the first volume then bills over, do bills long overdue and nuts.

110
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,616
But it's great self like monologue

111
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,063
two here where he says that's

112
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,019
disgraceful.

113
00:13:20,714 --> 00:13:33,267
Anybody that owes me less than two dollars is a pike. And here's where we see that worry room. Right? He's pacing a groove, a circular group thinking about what he should do about this p.

114
00:13:33,779 --> 00:14:17,143
Because he can't sue him for such a tri song. Norfolk we're clothes on his house. And at the end of this he gets this great devilish g and says I know. I'll put a collector on his trail. Very ominous. I noticed he also has a word bin in the background of his worry room. What is in the worry been Is that revealed later? No that's kind of a weird little throw gag that I've never really thought about and he doesn't repeat it again. Yeah. I'm not sure what that would be. I don't know. I think this this is a super strong opening page. I've been saying that with, like, all of these episodes because we're in his golden age but Barks is so good at grabbing your attention here. I love this one. So on the next page,

115
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:29,339
we see him make a phone call, and it turns out to be to his nephew, Donald because he wants to recruit him to collect the bill. When Donald arrives, he proposes if you go and

116
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:43,654
to... He gives the address. If you go to thirteen thirteen web foot walk, you can collect... You can take keep half whatever you collect. And Donald has this very funny. Tell me about what Donald pondering Al he goes there.

117
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:54,193
He's pondering collecting a bill for a million dollars from whoever lives at this address. I'm surprised that he did not recognize his own address upon hearing it. From uncle.

118
00:14:54,689 --> 00:15:02,065
Right. We've got... So he says, that'll be five hundred. I think he's saying he'll get five hundred dollars out of the million after taxes.

119
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:09,710
That was my reading of it too, Right? Which which feels like a a very Barks dig at at taxation.

120
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:35,076
The the pace of this story you alluded to it. Donald is going up to his own address. But because of the construction and how Scrooge is like plan to the seed of earning this money. That... That's my justification for. Donald does even register that's his. And so any when he opens the door, It's his own nephews, and he kinda does the double take and realize he said his house.

121
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:36,470
He opens...

122
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:43,489
He opens the note and figures out that, yes, it is his own Io you for ten cents to uncle.

123
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:54,857
On that third page, could you read me the panel about what he says about his old skin on? That old skin flint that greedy old turnip squeeze. He sent me out here to collect a time from myself.

124
00:15:55,396 --> 00:16:00,611
Why why don't you tell us about money he returns as well? So he goes back to

125
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,339
his uncle house, and throws the dime on the desk and

126
00:16:04,837 --> 00:16:07,890
screws kind of climb up onto the desk and begins

127
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:09,167
tackling badly.

128
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:39,519
That he never forgets any any debts no matter what. And he's been watching and waiting. And he starts kind of chasing donald out the door. He nobody gets the best of screw Inducks now. Todd along. So so Donald suddenly gets his bearings again and turns around and says, nobody gets the best of Donald Inducks either. Donald has both feet up on the door now on the exit. That was twenty five cents I gave you. Give me my change. So just to be petty, right, Donald has made it so that he's gonna have to give him change and he points out he needs a commission.

129
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:49,043
And so this little exchange is like gonna start this kind of sequence where they're escalating and trying to one up each other.

130
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:55,574
You know, he talks about how he just settled a ten cent debt for five cents.

131
00:16:56,134 --> 00:17:00,094
But as he leaves, he realizes Scrooge payton him with a worthless old,

132
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:01,814
nickel,

133
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:05,241
but Scrooge points out that he said that it was settled

134
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:07,833
when he returns to the nephews,

135
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:12,994
they figure out that the baloney nickel is a bit of a collectible worth five dollars.

136
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:14,192
And I

137
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:27,040
love the panel that closes out this sequence ryan at the end of the at least the fifth page here. Yeah. Yeah. Tell that. First of all, when when the nephew tell him that it's worth five dollars,

138
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:28,753
This is five dollars.

139
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:39,709
Donald had turns around almost a hundred and eighty degrees, and he's holding glass of water that slides out of his hands onto the ground and this flashing on the ground as he's in shock at this kind of wealth.

140
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:45,665
Right. So and even even with inflation, we're talking fifty bucks. It's nice but it's

141
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,323
So last frame of this page says, so for the next two hours

142
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,616
exclamation points,

143
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,610
It's so.

144
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:00,905
You didn't give me five cents. You gave me five dollars. Have you ever been took? Scrooge just just sobbing

145
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:12,867
on the desk and pounding is fist on the desk and defeat. For the ninety ninth time, have a heart sub. I I love that. I love that they're both so invested in this little brink ship.

146
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:15,581
And and so

147
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,295
you know, Scrooge

148
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:25,175
decides that he wants to turn things around. This is very screwed. Right? He never wants to come out on the the downside of a deal.

149
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,850
And so

150
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,450
it's given him the idea that he would like to sell

151
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,650
the rarest

152
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,370
coin in the world

153
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:36,699
and he indicates that quarter

154
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,016
that Donald

155
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:44,540
just handed it to. And he calls it, you know, this sounds very dated to me now. But a plain old nineteen

156
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,340
sixteen

157
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,260
quarter, which I'm going like the rarest coin in the world. So let's see We're

158
00:18:51,814 --> 00:19:03,032
about forty a little less than forty years old. I guess the equivalent finding a nineteen eighty some coin today yeah, That wouldn't feel too old. Yeah. Yeah. I hope it wouldn't since that's my vintage.

159
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:06,780
Funny little panel of donald having left.

160
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:11,065
Wondering if his smart old uncle isn't getting fuzzy and the w.

161
00:19:11,565 --> 00:19:12,425
I also, like

162
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:19,245
at the beginning of this page, we can see the the stream of tiers running out from under under Scrooge arm.

163
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:24,155
As he swear, he didn't know the nickel nichols were so rare. So rare to be worth five dollars.

164
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:28,350
Right. Alright. So this next sequence

165
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:42,026
is is all about how he is going to manage to make it the rarest coin in the world. Ryan, why don't you tell us about his plan But what's he gonna do here? So his plan is to... He has he has waged a massive

166
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:43,904
advertising campaign nationwide

167
00:19:44,443 --> 00:19:47,940
where he if any... Anyone who will send him a nineteen sixteen

168
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:56,350
quarter, he will pay them double and pay them back. So everybody in in the country has heard this message because it's on every station, and

169
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:10,805
everybody in the country mails him all their nineteen sixteen quarters, and he collects them and and, I guess, mails them back fifty cents. I like the notion that they're basically sending it to him just to to shut them up. Yeah. Why don't you hit us with your best nineteen fifties

170
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:15,744
advertising copy? Scrooge will pay double for nineteen sixteen twenty five cent pieces.

171
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:17,001
Excellent.

172
00:20:18,413 --> 00:20:26,398
So the next part of this plan is the shockingly legal part. Right. I mean, I guess, I guess he has the plausible den.

173
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:28,396
Donald says that

174
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:39,980
he'll he'll have to make... If he wants to make them rare, he'll have to make them disappear. But but he he seems to be assuming that he'll hide them somewhere. Right? But but Scrooge

175
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:46,430
flies them out into the middle of the Atlantic. It is specifically named as be the middle of the Atlantic

176
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:49,499
and he dumps the bottom quarters in

177
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:53,044
in a certain spot. Out there. And

178
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:56,406
and he goes home to he. He also...

179
00:20:56,902 --> 00:21:04,760
It's also worth noting. I believe I believe that's a b two Bomber. Yeah. He is piloting it himself and it bumps away as he dumps the bumper orders.

180
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,760
That's right. I think you're right. I think it is meant to be one of my guest hosts.

181
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:20,365
Ruben and Al had shared with me that there is a book that details all of the planes the Barks used in his stories.

182
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:37,218
So some in there, it actually does tell us confirms for us. And, apparently, they're, like, all real play. Nice. I made a note really quickly that this story was just a couple years after he did a very famous coin collecting story. His top rated ten pager,

183
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:46,530
which is called the trouble with Dimes. Feels very reminiscent and it deals with scarcity and a valuable point. But, anyway, He price the quarter,

184
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:58,960
what is it worth Ryan? It is worth ten sky dollars. A million times more than he paid for Right. And we're not gonna do the math because it it doesn't spoiler. It doesn't clock. But

185
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,763
but Scrooge is feeling so triumphant about it that as he tells, Donald, he's, like, tossing it around,

186
00:22:06,421 --> 00:22:08,855
like it's old penny as his nephew says,

187
00:22:09,548 --> 00:22:14,629
And Donald is, like, freaking out, he's telling him. Go sell it before something happens.

188
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:23,091
But Scrooge sc once to let it appreciate a little bit more and he enjoys the feel of it. And the the inevitable happens,

189
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:24,167
it

190
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:31,205
It drops out of his hands and rolls into an open window. Do you mind telling us the company Ryan? The Atlas pie company.

191
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:32,221
Yes.

192
00:22:33,114 --> 00:22:33,614
And,

193
00:22:34,113 --> 00:22:38,528
you know, in in researching this, I someone pointed out that that's for foreshadowing

194
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:40,385
because it looks like At lan.

195
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,153
And and I never picked up on that. Oh, yeah.

196
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:44,351
Interesting.

197
00:22:45,148 --> 00:22:51,332
And and so this is great. Like, this is just Pure slaps stick and pure mayhem.

198
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,548
This is like I love lucy or the three stu.

199
00:22:55,147 --> 00:23:00,300
And and I mean that in, like, the best way. Right? Because this is very low, but it's... But it's...

200
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,180
It

201
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,380
is

202
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,840
amazing. What what happens down in this

203
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,909
Fat? Look, if people... If there's anybody out there who can't get any enjoyment out of a colon on

204
00:23:13,328 --> 00:23:16,065
ten man Desk one pie

205
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:16,919
then

206
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:19,407
maybe maybe they're a little bit dead inside.

207
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:31,797
Yeah. Because this is just it's just shameless. It's just just buys in the face. It's just a hundred pis in the face. I I couldn't have set it better. This is this has gotta be one of comics

208
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,530
Nay cinnamon,

209
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,630
greatest pie of all time.

210
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,130
I'm gonna say that there's never been a better pie

211
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,170
depicted in in

212
00:23:41,605 --> 00:23:48,045
still drawn for. Yeah. There's... You can definitely feel some some genetic force in the way these are drawn.

213
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,800
Right. Especially just that glorious

214
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,240
half page splash panel

215
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,853
that that is captions. There is no better I then a.

216
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:08,326
I... That panel work art. And and whoever is coloring it and... I I don't know how it's colored Inducks uncle Scrooge number five but the color

217
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:14,746
in the graphic album that I have is really on on point. And then I like how

218
00:24:15,124 --> 00:24:20,622
when they run out of Ammunition, you know, these bakers that have gotten in this massive raw with Donald

219
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:34,550
Scrooge and and the Nephews who have joined and looking for the the quarter, which I I buried the fact that it's fallen into one of the pies on the conveyor belt, and everyone who's list has read this and knows would happened here.

220
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:38,914
They they they clean themselves off once the

221
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:44,898
Has come to an end, some pigeons come along to help out And and again, the predictable happens,

222
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:59,195
a pigeon grabs that shiny little quarter. And tell us about where he takes it He takes it to the top of the vampire state building, and Uncle Scrooge decides he's gonna run up there and catch the pigeon the top of the Tallest building in

223
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:07,985
in Duck or wherever they live. Right. And we've got a a flag pull gag. Barks has actually quite a few of these

224
00:25:08,485 --> 00:25:14,118
where screwed has to climb out and reach it at the knob at the end of flagpole pull. He

225
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:18,548
almost gets it. He has, like, a hiccup as he reaches for it and so it falls.

226
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:24,392
The the other Inducks try to catch it. But but last, you wanna tell us what happens.

227
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:33,037
And Donald tries to catch it in his hat, and it just rips through the hat because as as anyone who hears our been urban legends know, it's

228
00:25:33,895 --> 00:25:38,751
fast enough to kill a person or or whatever it's best in this speeding bullet. And it rolls off the curb

229
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:43,151
right in front of a steam roller naturally, steam rollers constantly going by

230
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:44,625
on the road and

231
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,777
smash it out to where it's

232
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,506
I would say three feet across. Yeah like. A perfect

233
00:25:50,845 --> 00:25:54,555
representation of it. It's still a perfect circle you can see the design. You could see the year

234
00:25:54,974 --> 00:25:59,741
Right. It's it's a neat little visual gag. It looks about the size of a manhole whole cover

235
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:09,163
I I remember that in one of Don Rosa stories, he's gonna have just a little offhand reference to this. But Scrooge, of course is devastated.

236
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,353
And Donald just like

237
00:26:12,143 --> 00:26:16,848
you know, what what's the biggest deal? You can just get one of the other quarters hidden away.

238
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:20,457
But, of course, you know, off panel,

239
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,330
Scrooge

240
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:28,764
reveals that he's hit it a little bit too well. It's kind of an unusual expression that devastated

241
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,881
expression at the top of the next page whereas eyes are very small. I'm not a accustomed to Severino Barks.

242
00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:41,390
Like express dust. Is that way? Yeah that's interesting technique me. I think that we're about fourteen or fifteen

243
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,225
pages. Here into the story.

244
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:53,497
Which, you know, is... To me, it always felt like it genuinely was a ten page up to this point, and then he, you know, veer into the

245
00:26:54,113 --> 00:27:03,481
adventure story. But... But it's it's really interesting. He is given... He's devoted so much of the time of this story for the Inducks. Again,

246
00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:05,913
they're about to journey to land.

247
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:19,110
And and we are still fourteen pages in. And And the perspective shifts over to the nephews here who are just kind of like, describing the problem, pondering the problem

248
00:27:19,745 --> 00:27:28,765
you know, they've obviously talked to screws who's recounted to the best of visibility where he he dumped him in the middle of the ocean Al about this angle southeast

249
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:38,672
And the only thing different about the spot was the color of the water, which was greener than the rest of the ocean. And then, you know, here it is. He... One of the nephews.

250
00:27:39,064 --> 00:27:45,340
Comments that our junior Wood chuck book of null says that could be caused by tiny

251
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:57,294
plants in the water, which would be there because the water is shallow. So you know, the that's are really excited Al implies that maybe they are recoverable and maybe they connect we find it.

252
00:27:57,873 --> 00:27:58,653
And I guess...

253
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:05,585
I don't know. Did you what did you think about Scrooge is bath there when they find him to tell him the good news?

254
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:15,300
At first it actually confused me a little bit. He's taking a bath of course in a a pile of shiny silver coins. The bathtub is just filled to the top with coins. And he has a bath,

255
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:19,845
made out of dollar bills. But I at first, I thought that

256
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:32,502
the Nephews had gotten the coins. Like they had found like were dumped and had brought some back and he was now taking a bath and his tense got really got really dollar coins. No. This is just one of those site gag that it was occurring to me.

257
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:42,968
Is, like, totally background, but is is a very fun Barks thing to do. Boy, he's gonna get a lot of mileage out of what will be renamed later the junior

258
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:51,453
guide. Our next couple of... The the next segment of the story really is is dealing with the Expedition.

259
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:56,420
There there's nothing too special about this, except that Scrooge

260
00:28:57,218 --> 00:28:58,316
pays his scientist

261
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:04,884
to develop. What would be and just an utterly incredible advancement in real life. Right? These

262
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:12,719
these suits. These underwater suits that self press and refreshed the air without any cables.

263
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:19,985
They've got a pretty cool dome shape to them as well. And they journey out to that green spot. There's a fun gag where

264
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:31,150
Scrooge and donald are about to jump in, but but Scrooge polls the redirect and chickens out, and Donald jumps on his own and the nephews have to have to push him in

265
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:45,184
And he ponder Al he as he sinks into the brian, he ponder as well. After all, I'm paying Donald thirty cents an hour. So The next page is is another pretty big Al transition. Do you wanna tell us about this? This is really cool.

266
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:49,988
So they noticed that the water's getting lighter as they go down and it's coming from

267
00:29:50,325 --> 00:29:51,741
bio and fish?

268
00:29:52,437 --> 00:29:56,741
Just this, like, thick thick crowd of bios lu and fish that they sync through.

269
00:29:57,393 --> 00:29:59,806
And they get below them and

270
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:16,353
the fish are acting like, like the sun essentially, and it's all daylight under underneath them. And they see a bunch of whales. I don't know why Scrooge says no no not wales. Well, I think screwed to don, it's it's... The lead has been buried. Right? Donald notices is the whales.

271
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:19,404
Scrooge notices the huge metropolis

272
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:29,381
on the ocean floor. Right. It's like one one wonder after the other. That this is... I I really like the look of the sunken City here. Yeah.

273
00:30:30,315 --> 00:30:33,935
I think it looks pretty spectacular. I think it's a really cool

274
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:34,875
reveal,

275
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:39,583
especially if you haven't already seen it on the cover because it's a again cover originally.

276
00:30:39,921 --> 00:31:10,587
Mh. That's yeah. I I like that. It has some, like, distinctive architecture to it. It has kind of a a feel to it, but it doesn't feel like it doesn't quite feel like moscow or the Ink inca or anything, like, you can't look at and go. Well, that's that looks... You know, that's influenced by whatever. It feels like it's a new culture. Yeah. I I totally agree you. I think that's exact what he was going for, and I think he really succeeded with it. It looks cool. It looks realistic, but it also looks fantastic.

277
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:23,828
And, you know, as they send all the way to the sunken city, there's this this interesting vibe to me. This tone, right? Where they're like, they're very impressed but at no point, do they consider the possibility

278
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:30,730
the their habits? They think that it's like a sunken city, you know, the they're not gonna encounter anyone here.

279
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,910
And and so Donald

280
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,710
is is pondering

281
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:47,197
in a way that is not very characteristic of him. Like, I guess because the nephews aren't there. He's saying this must be part of the lost continent of Al lan that sank beneath the ocean. Thousands of years ago.

282
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,243
And and it's interesting to me, Ryan that Barks

283
00:31:51,721 --> 00:31:53,139
reveals the inhabitants

284
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:57,505
so quickly and so, like almost casual.

285
00:31:57,965 --> 00:31:59,005
But what do you think of that?

286
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:02,225
I kinda like it. I I like that

287
00:32:03,165 --> 00:32:06,360
you can tell our heroes are being watched without

288
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,480
them knowing that they're being watched

289
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,560
which can can add a little tension or suspense or whatever. But

290
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:14,293
then we get the big

291
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,639
the big reveal at the bottom of the page where the king is just there on his throne

292
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:22,427
and all of his attendants and guards and

293
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:30,835
And now everybody knows, you know, the whole situation, but I I think we could have probably stretched that out a little bit for a little feeling of possible, payroll.

294
00:32:31,395 --> 00:32:37,215
I agree. This is... I love this story. I think it's a classic, but this is part that I

295
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:42,477
criticized this a little bit. I I feel like it's really abrupt.

296
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:54,056
As you said, it's a little bit unique. Because that is usually. Usually, there's a little bit more suspense. But we see these, like, in these these creatures that are down there, they're they're very

297
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:55,309
fish looking,

298
00:32:55,846 --> 00:32:59,180
maybe a little bit frog like but mostly fish like

299
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:06,261
and they're just kind of... The ones that first see them are like, playing a board game. It seems to be with the quarters.

300
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,216
And and the kim actually tells them, welcome to lan.

301
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,279
And, you know, the Inducks

302
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:13,779
are

303
00:33:14,235 --> 00:33:16,607
astonished as we would expect

304
00:33:16,984 --> 00:33:17,842
and they

305
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:32,924
they immediately try to flee. It's interesting how he doesn't kind of let let it sit and let the reader kinda take this sand a little bit more. I feel like everything moves so fast here. Maybe because he left the pie

306
00:33:34,182 --> 00:33:35,521
and the coin rivalry

307
00:33:36,075 --> 00:33:39,595
kinda similar on the other burner for a while, you know? Yeah.

308
00:33:40,715 --> 00:33:41,215
So

309
00:33:41,995 --> 00:33:42,755
Scrooge

310
00:33:42,835 --> 00:33:48,070
says that he's suddenly lost in interest and intense sky dollars as they tried to flee.

311
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:48,910
But

312
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,530
the the locals, the

313
00:33:52,305 --> 00:34:34,860
They capture them. The... I I do like that they don't really seem hospital. They seem like they're just living their lives, you know? But the king asks what brings you air people to our water world and Scrooge lunges at him because he's wearing some of the nineteen six team quarter. And he tells them that they're mine. I dumped them in the ocean I came down to get one. And the king explains that their loss says whatever comes to the bottom of the sea belongs to the water people. When Scrooge asks him for just one, he says, you can have Al lots. Doesn't... Doesn't matter. You're gonna be staying here. Two. And you wanna tell us about the reason that they're gonna be staying there.

314
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,160
Because

315
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,640
they also

316
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:44,771
fell to the bottom of the ocean, and they belong to the Al now as well. Right. And when screwed

317
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,226
protests. Right. Yeah. So then they need to be, you know,

318
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,298
taken to be recon conditioned essentially.

319
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:56,892
That's though where they'll no longer long for the surface world, but they'll they'll just

320
00:34:57,271 --> 00:34:58,091
consent to

321
00:34:58,685 --> 00:35:06,440
remaining in Atlanta for the rest of their lives. Right. And and the Land, they can't... They say that they can't let them leave

322
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:08,036
because he owns

323
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:09,671
newspapers and

324
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:21,745
the king, and and this is really one of the only times that the king gets kind of a fearsome look on his face He says met some greedy people would be here killing and robbing us for the treasures of lan.

325
00:35:22,365 --> 00:35:23,685
So so as you mentioned,

326
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,360
they are in a big jam. They're now in jail,

327
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,240
and

328
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:35,943
they have this... I love this character. This is such a goof ball move. Right? You wanna tell us about this character that they meet.

329
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:37,479
So

330
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:49,410
this guy is clearly a nerd. As signal to by his glasses and his motor board, as you know, smart people always wear their mortar Barks just around as Yeah. Head gear. Yeah.

331
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:53,756
And he's got... He's got some books, like a big nerd and

332
00:35:54,374 --> 00:36:06,650
something to write with or, he has a little pointer or stick. That's what that is. He If If they had electricity more electricity, I guess, he'd probably be running a podcast few decades later. Probably, yes. This is definitely the the type.

333
00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:09,243
So he starts teaching them

334
00:36:09,582 --> 00:36:12,240
in a a pretty pretty dry

335
00:36:12,818 --> 00:36:18,290
about the history of Atlanta. Although his entry begins with How do do to do? I'm your teacher.

336
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:23,090
Right. Yeah. He cracks me up. And again, we get this pretty abrupt

337
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:23,890
transition

338
00:36:24,604 --> 00:36:25,104
where

339
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:26,780
the the Nephews,

340
00:36:27,516 --> 00:36:44,003
as we would expect or worried that it's been a long time back on the ship. So they draw straws. One of them has gotta stay behind and two of them can use this... The custom suits that the uncle that Uncle Scrooge had made for them. And they basically

341
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:50,396
have the same progression as Donald and Scrooge. Right? They they send

342
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:52,750
and counter the sun City.

343
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:59,784
They verbal eyes that they're can't be any in. Have. They swim past some hidden lan,

344
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,740
and

345
00:37:01,397 --> 00:37:06,377
it only takes one page later before they are thrown in the

346
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:18,143
aquatic poke along with their own calls. And I like the difference Ryan between how the uncles receive the the nerdy teaching and the nephews. Do you wanna tell us about that?

347
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:19,641
So the net

348
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:22,930
are really interested to learn more about. It's And

349
00:37:23,668 --> 00:37:29,060
they like learning what the Al atlanta used to look like before they begin living in the bottom of the sea.

350
00:37:29,755 --> 00:37:34,655
And so if you actually get an explanation of how how lan

351
00:37:35,155 --> 00:37:39,707
switched from being a a normal Land Continent to to being a an underwater

352
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:40,666
city.

353
00:37:41,205 --> 00:37:42,184
But thing

354
00:37:42,524 --> 00:37:45,520
about the explanation there. Ryan? Do you wanna tell us a little bit about it?

355
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:46,875
I

356
00:37:47,295 --> 00:37:48,275
I actually was

357
00:37:48,615 --> 00:37:52,810
surprised that a little impressed that there was one because I I feel like most

358
00:37:53,310 --> 00:38:11,209
comics like this and probably even even previous Barks comments have where they encounter a new weird culture somewhere it's just weird. And it's, you know, hey, we live in a cave or whatever and so we're weird, and you just have to kinda roll with it. But here he actually tried to explain the evolution of how the city... The

359
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:15,504
the land was sinking very gradually. And so they started building their buildings taller,

360
00:38:16,023 --> 00:38:20,092
and pretty soon they just started building like air pipes out of the tops of the buildings,

361
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:28,307
and eventually, those were even underwater. But by then they had already been kind of stretching their ability to breathe them to water and just

362
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,036
evolved into gil and finally scales and apparently green now

363
00:38:34,493 --> 00:38:35,992
and all of that. And so

364
00:38:37,144 --> 00:38:47,550
Yeah. We have web fingers here on the on the same page from from the nerdy professor. And... I I I like that he took the... Took the trouble of coming up with a a vaguely

365
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:58,482
scientific explanation. Yeah. I I like it too. And and you're right. It's still very hand wavy. It's still, like, millions of years of evolution into a few generations.

366
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,198
But but he obviously

367
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:05,205
thought about it hard enough to kind of make the

368
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:08,956
look like that they look vaguely egyptian

369
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:11,005
in in this flash Barks.

370
00:39:11,665 --> 00:39:17,505
But but it's neat, it's a cool. It stands out too. You don't really get a lot of these kind of, like,

371
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,919
flash Barks

372
00:39:19,638 --> 00:39:23,135
thousands of years sequences in these Barks pos.

373
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:30,265
Let's see. So after this bit of patient. You know, the Nephews are really they're being

374
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:31,205
star Huey,.

375
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:35,665
They they say that they'd love to see more of the city And

376
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:46,135
I think it's really touching how the teacher gives them a hug and he says bless you boys, your interest makes me very happy be we get this little contrast between

377
00:39:46,472 --> 00:39:49,401
between their faces and Scrooge who has the thought balloon

378
00:39:49,937 --> 00:40:00,201
with his quarter on it having flown away. And, you know, they they got results from this. Right? Because the teacher does offer to show them the sites.

379
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:03,549
But he is not taking the older dots,

380
00:40:03,887 --> 00:40:14,773
partially because those two w ones as he says with season opportunity to a escape. But but also, I think just because, you know, the nephews have really softened him with their natural

381
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,984
curiosity and enthusiasm. Yeah. Yeah.

382
00:40:17,942 --> 00:40:24,608
You know, teachers teachers love an enthusiastic student. They sure do. You you don't have to be in detention or

383
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:26,020
get conditioned

384
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,140
Right.

385
00:40:27,478 --> 00:40:37,659
And and Donald points out the hey, but the kids have w minds too. So just watch, they're scheming a way to save us. Ryan this next sequence

386
00:40:38,195 --> 00:40:52,036
is I think this is probably, like, some of these stories that I read is a kid when I was really young there are specific parts that kinda stand out in my mind the most. And I think this is the part apart from the, like, big whale

387
00:40:52,494 --> 00:41:00,038
and city reveal. That stands out in my mind the most. It's it's the welcome to lan

388
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:01,356
sequence.

389
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,128
We don't get a ton of it, But we see these

390
00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:05,007
cool

391
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:06,206
interesting

392
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:10,641
quirky sites. Do you wanna tell us some of what what he shows the nephews?

393
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:17,175
Yeah. We can... We get a little sampling there. We get kind of the the main drag of town there. We see a diner

394
00:41:17,715 --> 00:41:19,435
with its sign made out of fish.

395
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:23,750
And although all the lanterns in the streets are just by lu and fish

396
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:24,710
and

397
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:25,690
flower merchants,

398
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,245
who appears to be selling

399
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:28,421
No. Al.

400
00:41:29,895 --> 00:41:30,413
Probably. Yes.

401
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:35,430
Then we get to see the whale milk station

402
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:39,905
where they're milk over a hundred whales, huge, huge whales, by the way.

403
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:40,284
Okay.

404
00:41:41,282 --> 00:41:42,715
They're not like or something

405
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:54,617
and then they go to a stadium where they watch wrestling matches between train squid, and there are currently two squid training in the ring right now, one of them is slamming the other one into the mats with its tentacles,

406
00:41:55,516 --> 00:42:03,101
which would be a site to see. I have to admit. I I would pay super bowl prices. To see two giant squid rest.

407
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,655
I think this is a lost marketing opportunity

408
00:42:06,433 --> 00:42:09,666
For whoever's out there right Espn or somebody.

409
00:42:11,277 --> 00:42:28,080
And would you get the other... I think even more hand way the explanation as the dot ask m y why he speaks English, and he says we have lance to understand all languages because ours was the first language and all others were learned from it. And I I feel like it's unlikely that say

410
00:42:29,217 --> 00:42:31,112
someone from ancient Rome would

411
00:42:31,689 --> 00:42:32,566
understand Spanish.

412
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:37,292
Right. Yeah. Like you said, that's very hand wavy

413
00:42:38,044 --> 00:42:46,607
That that would mean that say someone who spoke ind you're inc would Would know would be able to just talk to people who spoke. Anyway he had chi

414
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,539
Sherman, but

415
00:42:49,038 --> 00:43:20,280
I do like it when there is some attempt to explain why characters can talk to other characters who have no reason to speak English. You know, Bark does this in some stories then in some stories he just doesn't. Yeah. Yeah. It took two frames. It was right. Yeah. Yeah. And now we get kind of this little en of the human world. I I like how it kinda cuts out to this empty year part of the city Right. Where there is this old

416
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:22,198
cargo plain

417
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:23,956
that has

418
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:35,435
sunk and is precarious resting over one of the balconies there. The teacher is warning them. This is one of the few things he doesn't really know about down there. He says it's a fall from the year

419
00:43:35,935 --> 00:43:37,796
and to keep back, it's dangerous.

420
00:43:38,935 --> 00:43:42,595
I like that they have it that have lint actually have a cord.

421
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,967
So that, you know, you can't you shouldn't approach it.

422
00:43:47,066 --> 00:43:51,615
And he points out that ships from your world are filled with dreadful things that

423
00:43:52,075 --> 00:43:55,675
explode. Don't go near it. And I mean, he ain't wrong.

424
00:43:57,195 --> 00:43:59,855
And we're what, like, nine years after

425
00:44:00,155 --> 00:44:01,015
the ends

426
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:05,182
of eight years after the end of World war two

427
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,180
when

428
00:44:06,598 --> 00:44:09,871
how many submarines and planes and cargo ships?

429
00:44:10,404 --> 00:44:12,678
Would have brought down to the ocean floor. Yeah.

430
00:44:13,436 --> 00:44:13,936
And,

431
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:25,851
boy, I I really like this next sequence. This is probably the hand wavy of all of them, and it's it's very... It's it's maybe even still than the pie.

432
00:44:26,445 --> 00:44:31,730
But but it works for me. The nephews go in and they discover that the cargo

433
00:44:32,227 --> 00:44:35,338
is a a a big load of

434
00:44:35,976 --> 00:44:36,171
By

435
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:39,307
that were packed water tight.

436
00:44:40,506 --> 00:44:45,616
What do you think about this sequence? And you wanna tell us a little bit tell us about what actually have

437
00:44:46,995 --> 00:44:47,495
So

438
00:44:47,796 --> 00:44:48,976
they decide that

439
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:52,536
they could use the j boxes to distract the.

440
00:44:53,211 --> 00:44:55,070
While the Ducktales escape,

441
00:44:55,651 --> 00:45:03,725
which... Sure, you know? I... That's fine. It's is a new weird new thing for them. So Al At first there, ne professor is

442
00:45:04,386 --> 00:45:05,446
nervous about

443
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,386
what what it is or what it does.

444
00:45:08,066 --> 00:45:14,140
He's probably experience some other things that fell out of the sky during World war two as you mentioned, which would probably during his lifetime

445
00:45:14,441 --> 00:45:21,670
and Inducks reassure him, and he accepts that. And they would get one of the quarters from him and plug a quarter in

446
00:45:22,129 --> 00:45:24,126
and are sad that it doesn't start.

447
00:45:25,618 --> 00:45:33,800
Because for one thing, the water is shorted the electricity. And for another thing, they have no electricity. It's not plugged into anything. He's just holding in a plug out in the water.

448
00:45:35,695 --> 00:45:36,195
Right.

449
00:45:36,615 --> 00:45:52,312
So naturally, of course, if you live under underwater, you have a natural source of electricity which is electric eel. You just stick plug in their mouth, and you can power whatever you need to power. Electric cables have a hundred and twenty volts as nature intended. Yeah. You probably don't even need an adapter.

450
00:45:52,625 --> 00:46:00,578
I mean... Yeah Yeah. Just ram it in far enough down heard throughout. I like the eel that that just looks kind of per terms

451
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,083
got like a little question mark balloon, like,

452
00:46:05,356 --> 00:46:12,050
and I like the professor saying, you must think we of lan are old. Fashion. And so the

453
00:46:12,467 --> 00:46:14,084
the box fires

454
00:46:14,581 --> 00:46:16,796
right up the sound transmits

455
00:46:17,452 --> 00:46:18,550
through the water

456
00:46:20,178 --> 00:46:22,750
there are, like, just eight different reasons

457
00:46:23,086 --> 00:46:31,180
why this shouldn't work. It is a... It is definitely this issues example of of cartoon or comic watch.

458
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:39,576
But but I don't know. It works for me. I think it's really fun that it's this cool old fashioned looking

459
00:46:39,913 --> 00:46:41,051
box with

460
00:46:41,428 --> 00:46:43,901
some like big band hit from the forties.

461
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:46,648
With the Lyrics Mop head Molly,

462
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:51,749
jumping in Jive Jeep Golly, Mo had Molly is off her trolley.

463
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:58,086
And my malik is a Huey,. I I... This is as far as I can tell, not a real song.

464
00:46:58,685 --> 00:47:03,946
I would love for someone to record. He's he's calling you out listeners. Those of you who have

465
00:47:04,442 --> 00:47:05,341
nineteen forties

466
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:06,497
band.

467
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:09,307
This is your... He's giving you a mission.

468
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:15,832
That's right. It's it's your time to shine. There's also the lyric later, beat your chops and flap your gums.

469
00:47:17,245 --> 00:47:30,384
It feels very pro rock and roll to me, actually. I... I've I in my googling is, like, supposed to be big band, but it sounds like, like, roots rock. Sure. So this works out

470
00:47:30,922 --> 00:47:34,871
exactly how the nephews wanted it to. Right? The professor is just utterly

471
00:47:35,209 --> 00:47:35,709
delighted.

472
00:47:36,247 --> 00:47:44,618
He cries out music. The one great art, we never had in Atlanta this. He had referenced previously that all they can play the liar.

473
00:47:45,432 --> 00:47:48,296
And and he says, come here everybody, and I mean

474
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,173
everybody. And

475
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,842
in in short time, they've... They've broken out the j boxes

476
00:47:55,221 --> 00:48:02,575
and and the whole city is filled with music, I guess, for probably fifteen minutes before it does short out.

477
00:48:03,612 --> 00:48:09,629
I would also like to point out even the electric eel who is powering this juice box. Seems to be thoroughly enjoying the music.

478
00:48:10,842 --> 00:48:12,497
Beautiful that's really good taste.

479
00:48:13,272 --> 00:48:24,362
That's right. They love they love some swing. Yeah. I think this was the inspiration for Mg mgm t's song electric field. I believe that is... I believe that is factual correct. Right. Right. No fact checking.

480
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:42,543
So the Nephews are... You know, they they're left to their own devices they're talking about explaining how to... How the people can get the coins out so they can keep using it. They get a good supply of the coins uncle call Scrooge, and Donald who are just lang back into the...

481
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:46,099
In the cell. And then Donald sees the guards leave.

482
00:48:46,558 --> 00:48:47,977
The Nephews approach

483
00:48:48,529 --> 00:49:03,611
And they they know what to expect from their uncle. He's distracted looking for the coins as they head to the surface. So they the rest the bag that they've collected and tell him to get going. At the next page is is a is is a I think a pretty unique

484
00:49:04,189 --> 00:49:08,159
escape sequence. I really like it. You wanna tell us about the escape

485
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:11,030
So they're just swimming upward word towards the surface

486
00:49:11,607 --> 00:49:12,643
as fast as they can.

487
00:49:13,775 --> 00:49:14,275
Which

488
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:16,128
probably is not good for you.

489
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:24,501
I I assume there there's suits, their suits are next, you know, advanced technology. Right. That's main they're avoiding the Benz?

490
00:49:24,801 --> 00:49:24,881
Yes.

491
00:49:26,161 --> 00:49:34,456
So the Lan throw a spear through screws bag of of nineteen six steam quarters, and he's trying to grab just one before he gets up to the surface.

492
00:49:35,096 --> 00:49:35,796
But the

493
00:49:36,136 --> 00:49:41,848
the Atlanta are unable to go any higher because the you know, the character of the water is changing,

494
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:44,126
which seems seems reasonable.

495
00:49:45,064 --> 00:49:47,322
And then the king beg them

496
00:49:47,715 --> 00:49:50,447
not to tell any of the greedy ones about them. And

497
00:49:50,903 --> 00:49:52,359
and the nephews promise

498
00:49:52,975 --> 00:49:55,601
give their junior wood chuck promise that they will not

499
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:07,411
reveal his secrets. I I like that. I think it's very sweet. I I think it sub converts some of these this scape tropes where sometimes the heroes will... Well all but, like,

500
00:50:08,328 --> 00:50:10,344
set the place that they're escaping

501
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:12,058
from on fire

502
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,348
or it destroy some ancient

503
00:50:14,727 --> 00:50:16,546
civilization as they leave. So

504
00:50:17,004 --> 00:50:20,116
I I watch Ducktales a lot in the eighties and

505
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,636
it's been a while. I

506
00:50:22,976 --> 00:50:25,836
I have, like, a little flash memory

507
00:50:26,176 --> 00:50:41,166
of the... This escape, essentially. I believe donald dot Scrooge is taking... There's an underwater some underwater culture that is trying to stop him from escaping, and he is getting away with his money. They think it's garbage, and he is escaping with his own money,

508
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:57,536
and they try to stop him for a while until they remember Oh, this is garbage to us and we don't want this, and then they, like, cheer him on. Yeah. It's very similar to this. You... Yeah. You you got it. That come... That is I I was gonna mention this during the part where I usually

509
00:50:57,956 --> 00:51:00,016
kinda wrap it up and talk about other

510
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:00,836
medications.

511
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:11,568
Yeah. We'll we'll mention it then. But that's something some sharp remembering, because I barely remembered that one. So we're... Boy, we've we have

512
00:51:12,185 --> 00:51:21,761
storms through these thirty two pages. I I think, like Barks, we kinda dwell more on the the nineteen sixteen quarter and the Pie. But

513
00:51:22,221 --> 00:51:27,801
but, anyway, the lan part of the story wraps up with the duct escaping

514
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:34,556
they they make it onto to their boat, Scrooge has managed to retrieve a single

515
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:36,948
of the nineteen sixteen quarters

516
00:51:37,621 --> 00:51:47,491
Yeah. He said he says he's on top of the world again, and Donald cancels him to to, you know, sell it as soon as we get back, and he a sure Donald

517
00:51:47,947 --> 00:51:57,441
that he has learned his lesson. And and so he takes sit in as soon as he's back to a coin shop, and he now

518
00:51:57,901 --> 00:52:24,686
he announces that he has come to sell is nineteen sixteen quarter. The only one in the world And and the coin, the the guy at Coin shop looks pla at him and says the price is still ten sky dollars do you mind telling us about how this exchange wraps up? So Scrooge screwed says, okay. I'm, you know, I'm ready to sell it. Are you going to buy it and and the guy this? I don't have ten really in dollars.

519
00:52:25,546 --> 00:52:30,979
He says there's only one guy in the world with enough money to buy that coin. Scrooge says who's that, and he says an eccentric

520
00:52:31,598 --> 00:52:33,057
named Scrooge Inducks.

521
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:41,126
I I love this guy. This is like one of the times that I've actually laughed out loud. I remember the first time I read this.

522
00:52:41,646 --> 00:52:53,345
It's just paced so perfectly the way that the guy doesn't even realize that that's who he is. Yeah. I I think this is perfectly paced one of the funny moments in these adventure stories.

523
00:52:54,042 --> 00:53:09,333
I'm not sure that it even needs the little extra cap the last two panels where Donald comes in tells Scrooge that there... He's just learned that there's big money to be made in the rare stamps and we transition to donald in the trash

524
00:53:09,685 --> 00:53:12,736
pondering. What did he do this to me for?

525
00:53:13,113 --> 00:53:15,367
Because I I think that other gag is

526
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:18,591
way better. But what do you think? Yeah. Yeah.

527
00:53:19,391 --> 00:53:25,731
It's great. I like I like showing that Scrooge has thought through every stage of his plan to become

528
00:53:26,031 --> 00:53:27,571
outrageous more wealthy

529
00:53:28,046 --> 00:53:31,666
except for the fact that nobody has ten Sky Dollars.

530
00:53:32,726 --> 00:53:40,511
There is no one who can sell this to. It's just it's just I guess, you know, double the value of his his assets or whatever. And

531
00:53:41,088 --> 00:53:49,029
it can never be liquidate because it's the one... One of its kind I I look yeah. I think I think there is a good I think the extra two two panels is nice.

532
00:53:49,608 --> 00:53:50,907
It provides a little

533
00:53:51,701 --> 00:53:59,175
cap to show kind of the change in the character over over time to show that, you know, screw has had it with these scarcity

534
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:04,484
collector, get quick things Right. Because of nearly nearly

535
00:54:04,902 --> 00:54:16,046
getting assimilated into Al lan culture just to be able to have the only one of these quarters in the world. Yeah. U I'll buy that. I... Thought that sounds good to me. I mean, it's it's a nice cap. But

536
00:54:16,346 --> 00:54:20,286
maybe I just like that other gag so much. It's excellent.

537
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:35,817
It it really does seem to kinda wrap it up very quickly. The the whole story is very stretched out in the beginning. It's like very lang, I think. And then And then that middle and second half just just go by so fast and so quickly.

538
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:41,615
There's not as much breathing room. So So, yeah, that that is the secret of Al Lan.

539
00:54:42,711 --> 00:54:53,116
You were telling me that you are off... Before the podcast, you were telling me you enjoyed this one. What what are your what are your thoughts on this? So overall? I like I I I appreciate the story.

540
00:54:53,453 --> 00:55:00,188
Like I said at the beginning that would... That that goes so far from the beginning to the end, where it's not just like, here's a problem,

541
00:55:01,044 --> 00:55:04,872
you know, we have a little conflict about it. We resolve the conflict instead of you know,

542
00:55:05,964 --> 00:55:10,414
Scrooge is upset that Donald still owes him ten cents. And here we are,

543
00:55:10,832 --> 00:55:16,671
you know, a couple weeks later, and he he is the owner of a ten Sky dollar quarter that he can never unload.

544
00:55:18,028 --> 00:55:20,523
And he had to recover from that lan

545
00:55:20,955 --> 00:55:23,171
Yeah. He's discovered a hidden civilization

546
00:55:23,548 --> 00:55:24,048
below

547
00:55:24,705 --> 00:55:25,803
below a layer of

548
00:55:26,221 --> 00:55:27,098
lu and fish.

549
00:55:28,631 --> 00:55:36,991
And they milk hundred whales and squid each other in a stadium, and this is all just for the ten cents just because he's sting son of a gun.

550
00:55:38,086 --> 00:55:40,586
Right. Yeah. To progress from

551
00:55:41,126 --> 00:55:42,586
like, a little sq

552
00:55:43,126 --> 00:55:45,041
over a debt to

553
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:49,081
a pie. Maybe it's the world's greatest,

554
00:55:49,461 --> 00:55:51,121
but it's still pretty pedestrian

555
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:59,878
compared to, like design the most advanced diving app apparatus the world has ever seen, and then discovering the law city of Lan.

556
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:28,040
And then swallowing that secret for all time. It's it's quite the journey. Yeah. Yeah. Like, at one point in this issue, the central the central conflict is, how will I get the the quarter off of a flagpole pole that that the pigeon has it all. Right. And it's just it's just such a a a huge journey. And and each stage of it is amusing in its own way, you know? Yeah. You're right. I think each each stage of is very solid.

557
00:56:28,856 --> 00:56:40,534
For me, there there are parts that are super early, but it's a little uneven. Like, there are parts I think are very enjoyable, but not like maybe all time classic. But

558
00:56:40,951 --> 00:57:07,477
but but the journey for this one is great. My my impression of this one is that, like, the the thing about it that stands out to me that's really special is that transition from, like, ten page story that really could've have stood on its own. If he wanted to, he very easily. Could have made this a goofy ten pager I never gone to Atlanta. But then it does. It takes that left turn, and it turns into this really wild

559
00:57:08,109 --> 00:57:11,140
adventure story. With some pretty unique touches,

560
00:57:11,578 --> 00:57:16,464
I like how he brought in the Legend of Atlanta. I didn't really talk much about it. But

561
00:57:17,454 --> 00:57:28,055
Lan, of course, is goes back thousands of years. This is Al good... I think this is as good of a a representation of Al atlanta this is about any I've seen in pop culture.

562
00:57:28,472 --> 00:57:29,668
I like the Disney movie.

563
00:57:30,226 --> 00:57:34,077
Okay It's not like one of the all time best. But this is a pretty good

564
00:57:34,613 --> 00:57:35,251
representation of it.

565
00:57:35,865 --> 00:57:43,951
Yeah. So let let's talk a little bit about how the community feels about this one. You know, that we always like to check in

566
00:57:44,569 --> 00:57:49,673
with the the website Inducks where people can can vote the stories.

567
00:57:50,391 --> 00:57:52,327
So, Ryan, this is actually

568
00:57:53,063 --> 00:57:53,563
ex

569
00:57:54,035 --> 00:57:59,523
extremely highly rate. This is the fifth highest rated

570
00:57:59,861 --> 00:58:01,457
story on index.

571
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:10,391
It is... It gets an eight point seven in the voting. Good for number five out of more than forty two thousand stories.

572
00:58:11,286 --> 00:58:12,906
I think this is an excellent

573
00:58:13,206 --> 00:58:16,666
story. I do think that that's a little bit overly generous.

574
00:58:17,526 --> 00:58:26,786
I I I understand why the community likes it. Right? So first off, we're still... We're at uncle Scrooge number five. It's early on. He's kind of a establishing

575
00:58:27,206 --> 00:58:29,206
the, like, mythology of Scrooge,

576
00:58:29,966 --> 00:58:48,253
and it's been an incredible run. Right? Because we had Uncle screws number one was only a plural man, which is a super iconic stories and sets up a lot of the mythology of Scrooge. Uncle Scrooge number two is back to the Al deck, which deals with his past sets up in gold. It's also icon.

577
00:58:48,712 --> 00:59:00,808
Again it's like I'm creating the characters group. Uncle number three was the horse rad story, and it it again established a little bit more of that methodology. Four and five are the first

578
00:59:01,146 --> 00:59:09,118
of those stories that are not like just about establishing that mythology, but they're just about having this good

579
00:59:09,495 --> 00:59:09,995
solid

580
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:15,477
adventure. And he's like, firing on... He's hitting all of the highs

581
00:59:15,896 --> 00:59:17,794
of like this great comedy

582
00:59:18,573 --> 00:59:27,270
adventure these twists and terms I think the element with the worry room and the junior shots, even if people don't realize that it's like their first appearance

583
00:59:27,608 --> 00:59:30,998
probably makes it feel a little bit more icon it.

584
00:59:31,377 --> 00:59:36,552
So... And and it's got this high concepts too of the of the nineteen sixteen.

585
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:41,165
Quarter. So what do what do you think? How does this hold up? I

586
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,126
I can see why it would be

587
00:59:43,465 --> 00:59:51,051
one of the highest rated. It doesn't have any, like, weak points, it never drags. Aren't any gag that, you know, don't land

588
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:56,194
almost every page has something really great on it, like the word room or Yeah.

589
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:01,236
Or the squid wrestling in the in the boxing ring, You know, he

590
01:00:01,652 --> 01:00:06,241
he really just kind of ramped every every element up all the way. And

591
01:00:06,661 --> 01:00:17,854
and so it's just kind of a fun ride. Yeah. I I think that's right. It's just it's very solid all the way through. It's never... It's never worse than solid, and sometimes it's just outstanding.

592
01:00:18,612 --> 01:00:24,151
Sometimes that's what you need. Let's see. So I I do mention I like to talk about

593
01:00:24,567 --> 01:00:27,199
if he's done any of his oil paintings things or lit photographs.

594
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:34,080
Unfortunately, he never did one that correspond to this story. And you had talked a little bit about the Ducktales

595
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:36,697
episodes. So there was a duck

596
01:00:37,156 --> 01:00:42,421
episode that this was that was loosely based on this. It really doesn't

597
01:00:42,759 --> 01:00:46,412
take that many elements other than just Lan.

598
01:00:47,006 --> 01:01:03,396
I guess the fish people look a little bit like them. You all... I I saw a couple minutes of it before recording. The only thing that really stood out to me as identifiable as those kind of dome shaped helmets that he used on it. But, yeah, I was like the one where he was trying to get these

599
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:05,431
these glowing

600
01:01:05,768 --> 01:01:14,357
fruits or something and it was like a four episode. One of those special Tv events, so you were probably likely to see it. For that reason.

601
01:01:14,795 --> 01:01:15,454
And it...

602
01:01:15,911 --> 01:01:21,486
There was, like, I guess this meme for a while, there was a scene from the episode where he

603
01:01:21,984 --> 01:01:22,884
is ranting

604
01:01:23,383 --> 01:01:23,883
about

605
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,719
the the c monster

606
01:01:27,098 --> 01:01:37,933
eight my... What is he even say it's one of a few something from Inducks pai. Has gone viral. A c on straight my ice cream. That it. That's what's coming up and... Yeah.

607
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:44,111
But I I think that that may have been from this this arc maybe not this specific

608
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:49,605
It was never included in the more recent Ducktales.

609
01:01:49,925 --> 01:01:53,316
Although I think they referenced it briefly in one of the

610
01:01:53,896 --> 01:02:12,672
episodes. They never like, adapt it or anything like that. And let's see We... We covered. There's a lot of really cool panels here that we've already talked about for me, I think I think that some of them are just totally obvious. Right? Like the the descent where they see the city of first is an easy choice.

611
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:13,550
But

612
01:02:14,248 --> 01:02:16,344
so is that massive pie?

613
01:02:16,802 --> 01:02:19,071
Of course. That's another easy call

614
01:02:19,888 --> 01:02:22,062
As far as kind of more quiet

615
01:02:22,757 --> 01:02:24,014
subdued panels

616
01:02:24,351 --> 01:02:26,843
I guess I like the ones where

617
01:02:27,155 --> 01:02:27,655
the

618
01:02:28,033 --> 01:02:28,790
mer people, the

619
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:35,073
Are having their big dance party out there. And I like the kings, like, really pleading

620
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:47,266
expression as he's like, begging with the nephews not to not to expose them. I think that's a nice little panel moment. Yeah. How about you? What what panels stood out to you? With ones did you enjoy?

621
01:02:47,986 --> 01:02:48,806
We did mention

622
01:02:49,146 --> 01:02:53,146
the one where Donald finds out that the Baloney nickel is worth five dollars.

623
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:58,375
Just about just about Barks out and excitement. Right

624
01:02:58,914 --> 01:03:04,572
several dollar signs popping out of his head more than five dollar signs, I would point out our got said.

625
01:03:05,506 --> 01:03:12,832
Yeah. And then just the one below that. Two where he's laughing at him and he has been for two hours.

626
01:03:14,642 --> 01:03:14,722
Yes.

627
01:03:15,496 --> 01:03:20,796
There's also early on when we have the one panel, this would be on the third page,

628
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:29,922
the one panel of Scrooge inch over his desk and finally getting over the front of his desk climbing down the other side, pointing his finger right into Donald face.

629
01:03:30,536 --> 01:03:36,216
And and shouting again. I've been waiting on watching and then right below that two frames later,

630
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:40,651
is this is reversed as donald as pressing against the door, the exit

631
01:03:40,991 --> 01:03:48,506
pointing right back Scrooge and saying, and that was twenty five cents. Give me my change. That's a really good catch. Those are great

632
01:03:48,886 --> 01:03:52,466
and and... Yeah. It's great turnaround. It's great that they're

633
01:03:53,139 --> 01:03:53,997
to each other.

634
01:03:54,732 --> 01:03:56,507
Both characters are essentially

635
01:03:56,924 --> 01:03:59,098
horizontal and their in their argument.

636
01:03:59,474 --> 01:03:59,554
Yeah.

637
01:04:00,685 --> 01:04:14,231
Boy, Donald just bouncing lite light is a feather on the second page going to collect the the bill. If this is life owen one. I I gotta mention the opening panel too just him looking very

638
01:04:15,331 --> 01:04:16,211
Scrooge there.

639
01:04:17,025 --> 01:04:18,883
And in the worry room as well.

640
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:20,401
There's another great one

641
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:24,336
that has kind of a feel that I associate with these adventure issues.

642
01:04:25,068 --> 01:04:28,996
When they're... They've got their twenty second century diving gear,

643
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:30,670
and

644
01:04:31,007 --> 01:04:32,756
they're on their their boat

645
01:04:33,175 --> 01:04:36,252
they're both with a a a money flag. I just noticed. Yeah.

646
01:04:37,091 --> 01:04:47,670
And... But it goes wide. And so you see this little boat on top of these mountainous waves and just nothing else. And you see some wi clouds in this sky as the sun is going down

647
01:04:48,007 --> 01:04:58,376
and it shows kind of this isolation, it it provides this kind of feeling of adventure and, like, you know, we're really going somewhere where other people are not and and going to these links.

648
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:01,644
You know, to to reach our goal, and

649
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:15,336
it's cool. It's kind of... It makes you feel like something interesting is gonna happen and, you know, and then and then, you know, two pages later, we're dropping through the the layer of deep sea fish and and seeing the flock of whales, I guess, I would say.

650
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:20,520
Around the around the sub mediterranean city and you get this kind of wonder that I think was kind of

651
01:05:20,938 --> 01:05:27,200
alluded to a couple pages earlier there. Is there a loan on the surface Yeah. That's that's another good catch. Good

652
01:05:27,738 --> 01:05:29,395
good commentary. Excellent.

653
01:05:29,773 --> 01:05:30,712
Well, I

654
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:35,556
really appreciate you joining me to talk about this classic story.

655
01:05:36,213 --> 01:05:41,102
Just to be clear, I I do think that this one is like a a classic

656
01:05:42,134 --> 01:05:49,658
an all time class even. I'm just not sure that I would like put it, you know, in in the top five. That's like

657
01:05:50,211 --> 01:05:54,191
really verified air. To me this is, like, maybe a top fifteen

658
01:05:55,251 --> 01:06:08,606
top twenty of all time adventure story. But but well worth checking out, any closing any closing thoughts? What do you think about the sting man in the world? Dumping an unknown number

659
01:06:09,143 --> 01:06:12,674
of quarters into the ocean. I mean, apart from

660
01:06:13,131 --> 01:06:14,947
how many federal laws

661
01:06:15,723 --> 01:06:16,162
brakes.

662
01:06:16,576 --> 01:06:20,066
I think this is one of those very typical

663
01:06:20,483 --> 01:06:21,262
Barks

664
01:06:21,718 --> 01:06:33,013
hand waive moments where that's he needs to happen for the story. That's true. But... Yeah. But you're right. I think it... I think you could very easily have a scene where Scrooge

665
01:06:33,666 --> 01:06:34,166
felt

666
01:06:34,585 --> 01:06:35,085
extremely

667
01:06:35,543 --> 01:06:48,191
conflicted. I could easily imagine, like, Barks doing a a cut away panel where Huey, like convincing himself that he has to south the money. Yeah. That that's a good thought too. Nice. Alright. Well,

668
01:06:48,966 --> 01:06:51,584
listeners, hopefully, you enjoyed this

669
01:06:51,963 --> 01:06:52,463
episode.

670
01:06:53,161 --> 01:06:56,978
Please feel free to reach out, tell us what you think of for the story.

671
01:06:57,437 --> 01:07:00,669
Barks remarks. Is on Instagram and Facebook

672
01:07:01,287 --> 01:07:05,103
and so forth. Next episode, we get to cover

673
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:08,316
what is certainly an all time classic

674
01:07:09,016 --> 01:07:12,836
Trauma law widely considered one of the all time grades

675
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:29,931
And Ryan, I finally figured out a way to consistently close these out. I'm I'm just gonna read the the dialogue that is on the very last panel. So that said, now, what did he do this to me for? Thanks for joining us.
