00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:44,864
Welcome, come back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever a Grown man who enjoys Inducks comic books, and I have a returning guest with me to... For this

4
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:47,458
episode of the ten page

5
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:51,738
podcast which is basically our our back to school

6
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:55,700
episode and we're we're gonna talk about a pretty cool package.

7
00:00:56,114 --> 00:01:06,026
Of t and c or true and officers stories. But first, I would like to... I'm I'm delighted to welcome back to the show Patrick

8
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:10,853
block a fantastic Disney artist. Patrick. Can you

9
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:11,745
tell us

10
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:15,639
Were you were you one of the kids like the nephews, Did you play?

11
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:33,603
Sadly, really not only one so I can remember whole Scrooge career. Was like the last day of being senior. It was almost compulsory that everyone didn't show up. Sure. And cape Al is still going to school last day. That doesn't really count because everybody also going it too. So I was one of the ones that didn't didn't play.

12
00:01:34,538 --> 00:01:53,515
Right. The the... What's usually called the senior skip day. Right? Yeah. Yeah Yeah. Like you, I'm not a big cookie. I didn't do a lot of h keep playing. I I did I did skip school a couple of memorable times, my senior year with previous guest host Ryan Bailey,

13
00:01:54,089 --> 00:02:02,715
And I guess them magically this is appropriate because weirdly one of the things that we high school senior boys did was to go check out the newest Disney movie

14
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:16,170
at the time, it was move on. Yeah. So that was my big... I didn't ride the rails or or go fishing or anything like that, but I watched the Disney animated movie. Yeah. So Patrick's remind us. You are Inducks artist.

15
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:20,517
You you had a lot of work done in the, like, mid

16
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:27,845
late nineties they're thereabouts. Yeah. Well, from the... Yeah. From ninety three ish to early two thousand

17
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:28,905
storage.

18
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:30,265
For Gladstone,

19
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:31,205
Johnston

20
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:51,344
here in the states and then put months in Europe and then occasionally for boone and maybe that'll reason what's the come. Yeah. They they had a lot a lot of publishing turnover in that couple of decades man. Mh So did you ever... Did you ever do any stories that kind of have this sort of theme the the Nephews

21
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:52,759
skipping Scrooge,

22
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,892
That's a good question. I can't remember anything

23
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:57,184
playing

24
00:02:57,684 --> 00:02:59,624
specifically play stories. I.

25
00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:34,634
Yeah. I couldn't couldn't remember one of yours. I think I know most of them. But it was there was one story, the happy H, I think. We're they're not actually skipping school, but they decide to leave home and ride away. That's sort of counts is well is to they society like. I guess there was what forgotten about the Yeah. I that page for... That does kinda qualify. That's cool. Check that one out. Sounds fun. So I I really like this story. Right? That we're recording this in the dog days summer here. My own kid is getting excited about back to school shopping. And

26
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:40,154
this is where I'm gonna be releasing this. Back to school. It's it's always

27
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:50,818
an exciting time and it's a great way to connect with kids. Right? The idea of skipping school, even if you're a good student like you and I apparently were.

28
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:55,726
It's a fun little kind of way to to live like curious sleep through the nephews.

29
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:56,818
Sure

30
00:03:57,713 --> 00:04:00,484
even if they don't do it. Right. And so the Nephews

31
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,404
in and donald in this story. It's that very classical

32
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:06,320
idea too of playing.

33
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:10,032
Right? It's it's running off to to go fishing

34
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,517
or something very, like, it's very all america I Yes. And

35
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:17,111
I am... I am fascinated

36
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,941
Patrick by just the idea of the true office.

37
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:26,340
Right? Because that's like a very specific thing, and I feel like it's not very

38
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:27,297
salient

39
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:40,210
anymore. In in America, I don't think you really hear about true and officers first. Yeah. I don't really remember they're being a true officer, but I was a kid. Can't recall any the of the person like that. Can you you were??

40
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:47,466
No. Like I I always I heard about the idea. I think I might learned it from these stories literally.

41
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:51,636
But just always felt like sort of an old Hollywood

42
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:53,474
trope like little ras

43
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:56,764
or or something you know watch out for the truman office.

44
00:04:57,224 --> 00:05:03,817
Yeah. There were other clinics too that use true officers and stories like little Aluminum and Nav was the name of the true officer

45
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,529
Lots of stories about him. It must

46
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:17,168
common period. Yeah. Exactly. It's it's an old and I think I looked... I was looking into it. There there are still true and officers around that they're they're much less

47
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:37,335
of the track and catch them variety now. It's more it's more about having conversations with parents and business threatening legal action and and stuff like that. You know, I've worked Al schools, and I've I've been present with some conversations about how oh we're gonna have to have a conversation with this parents about possibly,

48
00:05:38,074 --> 00:05:45,989
you know, having having some unfortunate interactions, legal interactions shall we say. But... Yeah. There's this is a this is a really

49
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:52,924
interesting, like, pro were plot device that was used as you said in and a lot of old comics, a lot of cartoons.

50
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:54,124
And

51
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,218
beef four he...

52
00:05:56,677 --> 00:06:07,664
Before Barks would do the first of these true and office for stories, which is called True Al officer Donald. He actually did a a pretty famous Disney short cartoon

53
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:10,384
by the same name. And this was

54
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:27,715
this this was... The story was created by him and Scanner. Right? Is that the guy's name? Jack checking? It was creative by him and Jack Hannah who was, you know, his partner on donald Inducks finds pirate and a long time collaborator during that span where he was involved with the cartoons.

55
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:30,347
It was directed by Jack King.

56
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:48,145
And, you know, it's it's pretty good. Did you have you checked it out, Patrick? I thought it was quite funny. Yeah. There were some really really great gag and it's hard to compare Barks written story to one of those features because you they're a lot lighter tone and fast paced to more about the gangs and

57
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:58,036
animated shorts. And I thought there was some hilarious guys like the thing that ten eyes when you're trapped in the true track. And maybe giant and pen penalized they're nearly big as them. They flicked them open and

58
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:25,984
Severino the whole truck away. When done you see the whole truck spot the home with trucks completely all the woods going on. None that was hilarious. And then later when they're in their little club house thing don't tries to smoke them out. And they're... They have chickens like on the fire and they put the chickens in the bed with their hats on like, Don cooked them. Never get away with that. That was really funny moment too. Yeah. I I think you're right. That's probably the stand gag. Right? One of those like, fake those fake. I've killed my own nephews.

59
00:07:26,284 --> 00:07:36,154
Yeah. They to get away with today anything think. Right. It also just makes you on comfortably think about, like, these characters are Inducks. Right? Even the chickens.

60
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:43,874
Like, it it just... It brings that to mind. It's also one of the rare cartoons where Donald kinda talks for a long

61
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:54,356
lot. Yeah. He does. And you really hear you really hear Clarence smash voicing him, and it's I I find it a little disconcerting. You know those those cartoons.

62
00:07:54,693 --> 00:08:00,806
Barks was involved in them and he's not remembered for the. Right? Like, it's kind of a foot in his career.

63
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:04,614
It really set him up very well for

64
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,727
doing the kind of stories

65
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:30,440
that he was gonna do for years, because he... Because his mine kind of my understanding is that he kinda thought in story board. Sure. There a story artist, and that's basically the same kind of a job as where do for comic books. It's not that much difference. So it's like the perfect learning experience for him going into ko weeks. Right. I and I'm just so glad that he got to make that transition. Right? Because the the Disney

66
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:46,190
cartoons. Like, I I enjoyed them a lot as a kid. But they don't hold up as well for me as, like, a lot of others of the era. As much as I love the characters, like, I would rather watch Lu tunes from the same era or like a Al cartoon

67
00:08:47,303 --> 00:08:49,278
There's something about, like, just donald

68
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,446
versus his nephews. They're always at longer heads.

69
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:56,017
It's it's very... It's a lot of slaps take a lot of mayhem

70
00:08:56,728 --> 00:09:01,378
they're they're fine. They're funny, but there's know slab sticky is the other

71
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:09,094
is. More cleaned up and awesome feeling. Cartoons and safe felicia. Places be much darker and much gritty.

72
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:39,511
So this what difference. Yeah. That's about right. So I I didn't want to talk about true and officer Donald without mentioning that short that it's based on you know, that Barks worked on it. Don't wanna say it would have been five years before he did this first true story. So let's let's get into it. We are gonna open up with that first story that you did. Which is called True and off sir Donald. This one came out in January of forty nine

73
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:50,437
and it was kind of a milestone issue because it came out in walt Disney comments and number one hundred and and this is rated quite highly by the community. I'm just...

74
00:09:51,076 --> 00:09:55,463
Since we're talking about multiple stories here, I'm gonna talk about Inducks Al the outset.

75
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:57,780
So if you look at it on the

76
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:00,675
fan, like voting site Inducks,

77
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:16,984
This one has a rating of seven point six out of ten, which is good for rank number two hundred and thirty two. And so that's quite high for a ten pager. At at some point, I kinda broke all of the

78
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:20,119
ten pages out into their own list. And

79
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:22,599
that... This would be the twentieth

80
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,219
highest rated.

81
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:26,852
Ten pager of his on.

82
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:29,649
Yeah. So very well remembered,

83
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:36,999
you know, especially being that first true and office for story. And I think it's a lot of fun.

84
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:45,308
So the the thing about all of these stories, right, is that they're they're all gonna be about the same similar concept this

85
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:57,929
classic concept of kids wanting to play hockey from school. And so they're all really gonna center the Nephews. Huey, doing, Louie gonna be the stars of these for the most part.

86
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:00,558
Because there are students,

87
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,471
and they're also

88
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:19,356
going to be that kind of miss mischievous this version. Over the nephews. Right? Because Barks is gonna he changes his characters around as he needs doing. Sometimes the nephews are very like, Goody goody. Sometimes they're a little bit more on the of this side. I like

89
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:29,626
that. That's one of the things about his colleagues I really like is the way the one story to next is willing to adopt to see different facets that we personally. I agree. I think it's

90
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:44,949
definitely... It... It's something that made his stories work very well. Can how many hundreds of them he could produce. Yep. It made made it, so they're not all cookie cutter. So this one opens up is very clearly a winter time

91
00:11:45,288 --> 00:12:08,230
story. I like that, you know, this one. What what did I say it came out in? I said came amount. January forty nine. January of forty nine right? That was the cover date. So we are in the thick of winter. He he has a chance to be seasonal here. So the Nephews are basically ad the snow. They're on their way to school. And they're talking about wanting to play in the snow

92
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:12,759
and they're they're chatting about the idea of playing hook

93
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:14,794
and whether they should

94
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:36,075
and they decide that they'd like to if they can get some other kids to join. And so they they passed this kid called Butch. And Bark has used kids named butch before and think he's meant to be, like, recurring here or anything but and they propose that join that maids haven't you heard about the new true officer and they haven't.

95
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:43,709
So, you know, Butch is kind of standing in as like, informing the reader. But but he sets him up as very mis mysterious

96
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:44,804
wearing

97
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,683
disguise,

98
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:56,289
no one knows who he really is. But Barks has a really good job of setting him up as like this kind of fear the force of nature. It it does have a very very

99
00:12:56,669 --> 00:13:00,663
mysterious sort beginning couple of pages. Whole tone this story a whim

100
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:25,787
field compared to together other two stories. And I think the snow helps that the so nature of the story. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point. So, you know, this first kid brushes them off Butch is... He says thirty kids played hook from Bug School last week And he caught every one of them. That's enough for me. And they approach another kid named finn again, and he's afraid to even utter the word Huey,.

101
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,817
He sets up the some paranoia

102
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:47,111
by saying, he may be behind that tree listening. He may be that old lady over there. He may even be boring along under this snow drift like a mole but which is a nice little setup for a a pretty like something that's going to occur and that makes it I think seem a little more realistic.

103
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,501
And so Finn is so

104
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:51,652
count cloud by the

105
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:59,404
new true and officer that he's got a shiny red Apple to take to the school house. Man, this this just feels so classic.

106
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:01,335
So like, old School.

107
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:06,861
And so the Nephews, you know, they they're kinda seeing this now as a challenge.

108
00:14:07,454 --> 00:14:26,230
Because they'd like to try and out smart that flat foot as they say. And they they... Where do they go, Patrick? Did she notice that? To a hill, Cookie hill, they're gonna slide down the hills. So really flying in the face of the po they can't... Huey, call the Al from this point instead right

109
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:37,019
Yeah. I I like that, you know, they use the word a lot. That's definitely an American slang term. One of the things I saw when looking up that true and officers is that every

110
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:40,499
every country has, like their own very

111
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:41,339
specific

112
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,259
slang for that idea of of ditching

113
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:48,274
school. And it it was a a very, very fun to read through.

114
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,314
So, you know, the kids

115
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:52,914
set up to sled

116
00:14:53,547 --> 00:15:00,342
They have a great first run, and then they immediately get caught in a long net by

117
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:08,167
By the nature officer, you wanted about the the T address looks suspiciously, like the true officer and the cartoon.

118
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:18,659
Innovative criteria. It's Al done the skies. I don't think anyone really fell full for or is this disguise it's really complicated nice. Right. It's definitely that cartoon

119
00:15:18,996 --> 00:15:22,447
disguise logic. He's got like a mustache and he's got the classic

120
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:23,684
true Al officer

121
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:34,749
outfit and badge. Because I guess true officer basically is a sheriff. He looks as much like a spies. It does a true an officer to me. Yeah. Yeah. That you're kinda sneaky looking.

122
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:42,064
So, you know, the the Nephews kinda talking with him as as he's hauling them away and the the true and see wagon

123
00:15:43,295 --> 00:15:48,475
asking how they knew he was at H Hill, but he doesn't give away as professional secrets.

124
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:54,060
Thing on top of this vehicle then too can't and true.

125
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:01,704
Yeah. That's right. I didn't... I didn't even catch that. That's another good little fore shadow. So we transitioned pretty quickly here to the evening

126
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:08,264
and the nephews decide to slide down the roof of an old garage that has a keep sign. And

127
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:09,985
one of them

128
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:15,305
just break right through the roof. And do you wanna tell us about what

129
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:30,699
they discover in this building. They discover the hidden to officers a vehicle in this oh garage. And then they go down and take a look at it. Patty wagon and all. Right? The t papers and the seat. That's when they discovered that the children's officers is

130
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:33,733
done. And something something I noticed

131
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:49,397
Al long time ago that really this way, at least of my Barks library company the front in the back and of the tune off vehicle says you two. Does your copy have that? Yeah. It does. And this was written in nineteen forty nine. And the actual Youtube spine playing which uses Al

132
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:51,410
kinda of gear, like, radar

133
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:53,362
detecting sounds and periscope,

134
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:58,609
started into production nineteen fifty three. So I wonder someone in the Cia

135
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:14,808
liked Carl Comic books didn't actually read the story. And the name of the Youtube spine is so famous. It's expired on the Soviet union took the photo first, like long distance photographs sync. Surveillance? Change the idea came from this store. So least possible. Other things have come from Barks workspace. Yeah.

136
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:39,539
Goes the way in the bottom bottom panel, this story of this this this page there's a radar track Scrooge a gadget of detecting zones and the Powers in the surveillance Youtube vehicle. Yeah amazing. It it is. It's it aligns like, perfectly. If not for the fact that the timeline doesn't doesn't match, I would think that Barks was doing an homage to it. Well, nineteen fifty three is when they started

137
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:48,610
research. So forty nine, the story comes out. Someone reads the store in by a time in fifty three fifty four, and he named the project. They just, you know, have to come from somewhere,

138
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:51,524
Know. You may be on to something.

139
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:58,164
And and I think that this stuff is is a real part of the appeal of the story

140
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:02,339
for me, like, when I was a kid that this just seemed...

141
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,539
You know, it's it's all very old fashioned now. But it still seems a technical

142
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:26,074
tech at the tone. Yeah. It's very cool stuff. So they they established that obviously, this is how they he was able to track them. And so they just side that, you know, they're gonna take another crack at it. Now that they know his deal, they can be one step ahead of Donald. Yes. And so

143
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:27,354
morning

144
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:28,614
Right.

145
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:38,752
Exactly. They're gonna have some fun with him. So the next morning, they ham it up They talked very loudly about playing hook again and out smart that true and officer

146
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:41,742
back at Hill, and this does

147
00:18:42,294 --> 00:18:46,231
This makes donald due what Donald gonna do. He he runs off

148
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,146
half half cox, you know, putting his teeth annually,

149
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:51,145
and

150
00:18:51,739 --> 00:19:14,009
He tries the same stunt. Right? The reader is probably... I know I was like, come on. There's no there's no good reason. That they should fall for this again. This is donald being kinda will for. Mh. So this time, I I do like this Patch account we see the same sequence, but now we get it from his perspective. Right? It's almost like this.

151
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:40,649
Yeah. And so he's watching them approaching the nets. He's saying they're even dumb than I expected. But the three slides rip right through. You wanna tell us about why it's because they have rocks and the slides this time instead and so. They love the panel where he's coming out of the door house in this page. Is really angry. You got the stop kind of run kind thing going on. It's really beautiful you. Yeah. That is a neat pose. So, you know, Donald

152
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:42,299
inspect the

153
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:43,456
slides

154
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:49,201
and realized what's going on. And and again, there's a really cool panel when he is

155
00:19:49,594 --> 00:20:11,732
all frustrated and he's looking around, and he's like, racing around all the trees. I really like that one. It's nice. And and it turns out that the Nephews have hidden in some false bottoms of the sled. And so Donald resolved he's gonna head back to his truck and use his radar beam. And And at this point, we just get to see in this next sequence.

156
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,027
How the kids have sabotage

157
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:17,435
all of his gear. Do you wanna tell us about what he encounters?

158
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:26,132
Use his radar and Al again out of this as a blur and he puts on his ear phones and Al yours is like Grass and like raspberry.

159
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:27,765
You know. Still at my periscope

160
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:28,660
Uses is the Barks

161
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:33,199
can see is himself looking back in. So they really valve things up sabotage.

162
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:36,495
My whole outfit has been blessed. Al

163
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:49,939
little bit of World war two Jargon there. Right? Very we're not very far for we're to at this point Right. Isn't it amazing to think about how much that just perm permitted pop culture that, like, you're getting this cut kind of

164
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:52,895
that kind of language and Inducks kid's comment.

165
00:20:53,314 --> 00:20:54,813
So, you know, the the Nephews

166
00:20:55,392 --> 00:21:02,504
clearly have figure... The jig is up they know who he is. They're having a fun with him, and he is just getting angry or angry.

167
00:21:02,884 --> 00:21:07,104
He tells him you kids are gonna get the works. We had some really great donald

168
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:08,198
tamper

169
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,329
panels, I think in this story. It Andrew.

170
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:20,694
And and they can easily out run him in this snow. So they're just really ras him. They make a... They make a snowman

171
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:33,134
with a fake Barks style i's like. I think that's a pretty famous image. Right? Because I think Barks had a cover like this. Didn't. Yeah. They've used that image. I think Jim Gladstone

172
00:21:33,254 --> 00:21:37,209
used their image for a couple of different things. I think my copy of this

173
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:41,609
I think it originally had it, but it sadly lost the cover

174
00:21:41,949 --> 00:21:43,229
at one point. So Yeah.

175
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:54,416
Hello zoomed and panel in the panel before donald looking booking at at them with the snowman. The walls never like don't think of something music. It's another beautiful for job on. Yeah.

176
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:57,449
The way he's draped and snow partially

177
00:21:58,029 --> 00:21:58,669
very nice.

178
00:21:59,629 --> 00:22:13,449
And so he he gets Al idea and tells them, you know, I'll be back in ten minutes. Take you law break or single handed. And this really free them out. Right? Because you they can tell. He does

179
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:22,061
have an idea and they start to reflect on what they have been doing and worry that they've gone like, too far, you know, because

180
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,015
he... He is an officer of law. He does have that badge

181
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:27,989
So

182
00:22:28,488 --> 00:22:32,464
do they they go ahead and fix his equipment, basically.

183
00:22:32,962 --> 00:22:42,114
I like that it turns out that they just put wasp and the phones. Yeah. I like the fact that they say that it's Al wasp, but looks just like a cricket coming out hip

184
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:42,734
legs.

185
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:48,689
Yeah. You're right. I noticed that too. It doesn't match. You you wonder if

186
00:22:49,189 --> 00:22:55,044
Mark's just changed his mind or there that carl was up to it Al moment. Not sure. Right.

187
00:22:56,244 --> 00:23:01,356
And so you know, Donald drives the out he makes them weight and

188
00:23:01,694 --> 00:23:07,880
they start to get nervous and they kinda... This is one of those situations where they talk themselves into a mistake. Right?

189
00:23:08,494 --> 00:23:15,805
Because one of the nephews realizes is oh, he he can probably get us for making that snowman. That's that's contempt of court or something.

190
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:55,792
So they they resolved that they're gonna knock it down and then spam. And I love this panel here. Patrick where they approach the snowman, tell us what's neat about it. Defective that it has a little trail behind it of the snow reading up to it, and we've been have warned about earlier the story from a had Al little kid telling me that you could burrow through the smooth. Right. Exactly. And and the nephews can't see it from their perspective So the reader knows just a moment ahead of time. And that Donald has like into the snow man it's definitely a cartoon logic. If you keep you can't really do that, but it works in this context and it's it's pretty

191
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:58,536
funny and exciting when he pops out snowman.

192
00:23:59,294 --> 00:24:01,567
Kid guam them. And he says,

193
00:24:02,245 --> 00:24:08,024
the law returns to Cookie Hill. And the story wraps up very nicely

194
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:22,949
on the last page here. You wanna tell us about how it concludes? Well, Huey,. He's outs more than the back in the truck they're like, Oh like, how they say, you bored, like, the into that snowman, like a termite, that wasn't fair. It's kind of be his capture, but still have none of

195
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:28,643
well now. What do you say that and you walked to school? And they say, wait. It's a good joke on you.

196
00:24:29,362 --> 00:24:34,327
Saturday. There is the Scrooge the school locked. Name has a big padlock. I think that's hilarious.

197
00:24:34,965 --> 00:25:11,807
Goodbye smart. Yeah. Hell all that trouble for nothing. You be the donald is just a minute by the authority vested in the vantage of true officer and carrier a key to his school and his uncle donald dot authority of this poker he has a stick I can you to write one hundred times on the board the words prime does not pay. By the way, Huey, Prime has spelled with a need can't spell it Crm I Right is they need they need the school. Yeah. He he needs to dumb them down a little bit too, because in most of the adventure stories, they're they're very bright junior wood checks. Yeah It's it's a it's a pretty classic ending. The

198
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:12,804
the cartoon

199
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,321
itself ends

200
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:16,635
in largely the same way

201
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:26,723
except that the Nephews really do get one on over on Donald. And I think I know it's in Thomas Andres, book where he speculate that may be because the cartoon,

202
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:36,641
you know, you you'd see it in theaters and you'd really only watch at once and it would happen so brisk you wouldn't reflect on it that it was okay to let the nephews win,

203
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:54,419
but that maybe it was felt that, you know, in a comic book that kids might read over and over, they can't fly authority like that and and Donald has to come down on them at the end. And though didn't actually cook this one. Yeah. Exactly. What... Yeah. Even though it's nominally an adaptation of the cartoon,

204
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:59,979
they really have very, very little common. That's right It's really mcdonald's

205
00:26:00,413 --> 00:26:01,670
Donald look

206
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:16,259
and the ending set up, and and that's really just about it. Yep. So I I like true Al officer Donald a lot. I think this is just a really good example of Barks work from the nineteen late nineteen forties period

207
00:26:17,054 --> 00:26:20,114
It's a nice like donald versus the nephews.

208
00:26:20,694 --> 00:26:38,665
Yep. It's it's a very fun story. It's... I think it's well positioned as far as where the community thinks. You know, that number twenty ranking that seems pretty, like, on target to me. It's not like an all time great, but it's a very good story. This is very sold So we are...

209
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:51,240
We're gonna go ahead now and transition the to the next the next of these three stories. And we're jumping forward in time three years. To the story called the true Nephews.

210
00:26:51,658 --> 00:26:52,717
And this one is

211
00:26:53,055 --> 00:27:00,374
in Walt Disney comments and stories number one hundred and thirty three. And this one is kind of, like,

212
00:27:01,173 --> 00:27:03,149
regard as being an average

213
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:08,272
Barks story by the community because the the rating is quite a bit lower.

214
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,188
This one is

215
00:27:10,606 --> 00:27:20,380
a seven point two out of ten, which is good for number seven hundred and nine t. So, you know, when you consider that there are, like, forty one thousand

216
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:26,496
stories, that's not like a bad ranking. But that tells us that it's not really anything

217
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,807
special as far as

218
00:27:29,423 --> 00:28:09,575
as far as these stories go. Okay. Perhaps perhaps the reason for ranking Al those it is is because it's just an nephew for the most part to the whole story where there's no donald, you know, feature debt, and I think the Al lot of people base their like on donald stories because it don't die. I click count for some so because it's actually beautiful drone the store It's like absolute Barks is absolutely peak as far as drawing. It doesn't really do any better than the months right around the Right. Because this is definitely like nestled and right in his golden age. Yeah. I really like this one. I think that this one I think that this doesn't really do it justice

219
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:11,232
the the low rating.

220
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:18,769
Where or the the fine rating. There is done donald in the store. Don't yeah. It's it's the only story I can think of

221
00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:29,702
entirely the kids. It's it's notable for its lack of anyone else in. Right. Yeah. That's true. And and then even the title itself really refers to centers than nephews.

222
00:28:30,254 --> 00:28:30,754
So

223
00:28:31,452 --> 00:28:35,269
at the true and nephews, it also has the nephews kind of Al their brat

224
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:55,347
and and that might rub people the wrong way. A little bit. Right? That's like... On this one particular when they can't wait everything that they do is they keep running into schools. So it's like know they're brand. It seems like the... I guess they sort off kind of. Yeah. They've definitely got a very, like, un dewey or or it's more of the cartoon

225
00:28:55,739 --> 00:29:05,332
Huey, dewey Louis attitude and the com Q Dewey Louis Attitude I'd say. Alright. So let's go through this one. We we basically have we have Donald

226
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:16,195
chasing them with a switch. So, you know, we've got a couple of these stories that report... Referred to some corporate punishment. Definitely something that hasn't aged very well.

227
00:29:16,892 --> 00:29:19,148
But he's chasing them with a switch

228
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:31,945
to to get to their first day of school. This is a very common place gag. It's not like it's unique to Barks to depict this kind of punishment. And they're just soaking on their way to school.

229
00:29:32,839 --> 00:30:14,783
And I really like this Patrick how they're talking about what they really wish they could do. Tell tell me about what they wanna do But, first of all, I don't I don't think there's ever been a time when they're more beautiful drug those page with their attitude we know it they look at their heads, a wonderful door they're like they're like perfect nephews. It's like it may never look better before after this they're exactly something very exact about the joy. The wonderful for a wonderful line. Yeah. Yeah. I don't want to go to back to school I went to sleep late in the mornings and fish in the afternoons. We too They said they're already smart, and I only to it us good just because I'm old focused made up a lot of saying we have to. That's why all creepy cranks that think books are more important and swimming and. There's love them for they're out

230
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,873
like that It's just like wonderful

231
00:30:17,731 --> 00:30:23,519
yeah. They're so angry about school. I don't think that they're bragging so much if they're just, like, fed up with fed with

232
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:34,801
And I I don't I don't feel like... I'm I'm against them at this point. I think that like, you know, I kind of like their attitude in this particular so it's different. Know They're not like goody two are kind of like

233
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:40,925
revolt against the system the. Yeah. It's definitely a change of pace based on what they're kinda typical.

234
00:30:41,897 --> 00:30:47,024
Characterization is. I'm noticing too that, like, Barks really does some signaling with their hats

235
00:30:47,442 --> 00:30:50,351
in this one. He draws them, like, very,

236
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:52,665
you know, cock a little bit

237
00:30:53,083 --> 00:31:58,062
yeah kind feels to have Yeah He you puts a lot of details like attention to details and nephews in the store. I think he have a lot of thunder on this person. You can always tell is enjoying it, you know, you can just tell because he puts he lab lavish, like attention not attention as in details, but the details that are there is so clear. And and the layout of is page, just the way they're slowing and down the street. Each panel is different and interesting. And it's not something it's particularly exciting going on we're just walking to school. They just express wonderfully. Right. And we're in that golden Jira where he he really did a lot of detail just in his backgrounds too. Like you said, I'll just a lot more attention, than he honestly needed to. Yeah. Absolutely. How about that panel, the the second the last one on this opening page where they're t up the stairs and single file, I think. Looking at that one, it's really calling out to me. It's a really neat one. It's just a beautiful page. And and then basically, the whole setup for this story is where they say, I'd take off in a minute if it weren't for Donald eagles I.

238
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,618
And it's and...

239
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:01,015
Yeah. That's

240
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:04,685
that's how that's how this is gonna go. Once

241
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,175
Once Donald learns the next morning from mister Bum,

242
00:32:09,754 --> 00:32:12,411
that he's landed a steady job at Bum

243
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,510
bucket Barks.

244
00:32:14,044 --> 00:32:39,447
And and he won't be home till late tonight and that it's basically up to the nephews to get themselves to school. You know? They know they're they're in the clear. They dickens, like, name mister Bum It doesn't like it great Yeah. So Donald then manages them, but that's really all he can do. And we have our setup. They resolved that they're gonna play hook Severino everyday, and they set off holding...

245
00:32:39,864 --> 00:32:46,364
They're each holding a Inducks, Right? Like a h, from this Sarah wood or or an adventure kid would.

246
00:32:47,122 --> 00:33:06,959
I love parents Al he's going out the door. See that you do that as and they're best dog Yes. Oh, yes. They're so happy gone. That's right. And so as they walk off, they're talking about all the fun that they're gonna have. But very quickly very brisk. They encounter Donald delivering a load of buckets.

247
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:38,725
And so they're forced to turn into a building. You wanna tell us about what they experienced. And, of course, it's the bus Barks for school buses that they were forced into just horrible because sweden them to Scrooge, so speak out and here comes a teacher down the street is the country express truck here kurt five minutes. We've been playing hook and already was surrounded. They got buses on one side, Donald on it side teach you on the other side. So there's no way to go to pretty country express. Right. And this is gonna set up the dynamic for for this whole story. Right? They keep getting

248
00:33:39,222 --> 00:33:39,722
railroad

249
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:41,413
into these

250
00:33:41,752 --> 00:33:46,128
situations that bring them to school. It's kinda like reverse Gladstone gander

251
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:51,773
left or something it is. Mh. This bad luck for them Al around for their crummy

252
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:52,749
on page?

253
00:33:53,148 --> 00:33:57,413
It's a really good bit. It makes for, I think, a very effective story.

254
00:33:57,751 --> 00:34:05,228
And I feel like Barks has done this a few times. Right? He likes this kind of, like, series of circumstances that does

255
00:34:06,856 --> 00:34:11,742
has a sense Huey,. Yeah. Basically. So, you know, they do what they have to, they

256
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:14,851
themselves away in this country destin

257
00:34:15,164 --> 00:34:36,704
truck. And after a span of time, they find out where it's gonna deliver them. Do you wanna tell us Yes. Course, they're hoping know, cattle branch or something like that. They're gonna go to the suffering sour tomatoes. This truck was bringing Al load of school Barks to a beat up old country store. There it is full district point zero zero three. Right. Al the dismal

258
00:34:37,244 --> 00:35:03,267
eating lock, Severino nevermind the grape, save your win for running. So they're still running at the end the end of this page. Right. And and so, you know, they they have to transition to to keep getting away and they end up going away on a train and of course, that ends up having a school car that the little school arm explains is stationed here for the section games. Children. Mh. And

259
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,424
so again, they narrowly

260
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:22,059
escape the worst situation going to Google. Is wait, you can't leave that. You must check in. That's where you're wrong, Way. We're checking out. And you jump off the train. It's at this point this what I remember first time I thinking what no like how are they going get school situations they jump on the train? Right.

261
00:35:22,939 --> 00:35:29,589
Right. And and Barks does a neat thing in this story. He has like this verbal running gag that I'm just noticing.

262
00:35:30,028 --> 00:36:00,299
Because you you had highlighted the dialogue where they said of all the dismal moth and luck as they leave that rural school house and this time, as they jump out of this one, the Nephew is saying of all the low downs leave didn't luck. And and so they they follow the rails now at this point, which leads them to an airport. And this this is pretty cool for some board kids in the nineteenth of these going to school. Yeah. Exactly. They can watch the planes take off and land.

263
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:12,764
And they they go and watch one plane being loaded up, and they they're good they decide to go look inside but one says, but make sure it's not a school playing or some such movie. They realize the chances against them at this point I think.

264
00:36:13,262 --> 00:36:32,440
It's being loaded pick and shovel and buckets and the owner says buckets and may Al and the distance going bucket they've got hide in like coaches. Right? Yeah. It's really neat how the story just keeps n them into this situation. So again, the story logic has them tracked into this chest.

265
00:36:32,940 --> 00:37:03,710
The plane ends up dropping it out of the cargo hold with a pair, of course. So you know, they're they're a little bit messed up, but but they're safe, but they're in suspense. As they land. There's a really neat drawing of aircraft and stuff in the place are gonna jump to go out and it's just really nicely drunk. Al lot drawing this, like, very nice with serve. Right And and Al first, you know, they're a little bit, like, stressed out about this situation. But then they realized this is actually pretty perfect. Because they're finally

266
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,750
somewhere where they won't find any schools, true and officers,

267
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,410
or even they're uncle with his buckets.

268
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:48,484
And Barks sets up this this gag very nicely. One of the Nephew says, you wanna read... Yeah. It's really funny. There must be forty miles from the nearest school. Perfect place sweet booking. Should be Al awake where we can go fishing. Yeah. Maybe wake up this new road their building. They're building this road to go someplace. That's for sure. And that's whole hilarious panel. I think this is very fun Rock Hill School District, the only school for forty miles says off the building. And teachers ringing the bell is happy little kids with apple going in stuff sour tomatoes, and they realize that it's like, hopeless. It's a one wonderful. I love that kind of gag wear like it's set up with the dialogue

269
00:37:48,863 --> 00:38:20,413
and then the payoff is in, like, the narrator text or in this case and just the signage. It's it's. It's the perfect integration of both pictures and words. And collin colleagues can do that. Yeah. Oh. That's that's a great thing to point out. Right? This is Barks like really using the medium in a way that makes it work. This is why people like comment, but yeah Sure. And it's like the perfect example of that happening. And he does the timing this wonderful. Right. So so the nephews, of course have to continue fleeing

270
00:38:20,992 --> 00:38:39,525
And they kinda tumble down a hill, you know, they there needs to be some poetic justice. So Barks wants them to get a little bit rough up in the process for the for the payoff. And they Al interesting thing when you're telling the story, you know, you expect in this first top half of the schools paying, they're gonna gotta end up for the school. You know it's gonna have

271
00:38:40,223 --> 00:38:56,166
sure. Right. Inevitable. And the thing is that the guy is so smart about plan his stories out He doesn't do that. You know the climax wouldn't be as good as the Scrooge no matter how wonderful big the school was. The fact that something else related the school makes a hundred times better Yeah. This this

272
00:38:56,805 --> 00:39:00,514
That he takes at the end is is This is an excellent

273
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:22,569
payoff and I... It's the stand moment in this story. It makes for a great Al. Do you wanna tell us about where the road leads them. But they can see it's a big resort, so they think they're safe. We could buy a hamburger and then once like, wait either there look this place over, before we go in. They're like, why? We know this isn't the Scrooge, they be full fishermen hunters. People like us, they think he themselves as fishermen

274
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:32,651
still Scrooge pound. The the one still just the same, I don't feel safe any place anymore. It says dining room so know you must be safe go in and there it is. True and officers

275
00:39:33,045 --> 00:39:41,985
send off luncheon and for all true officers in Webb foot County. And all the true offices is attorney and looking at the kids and most of them have, like, an expression like

276
00:39:43,060 --> 00:40:10,315
funny especially They're gonna eat them up, you know and they'll have true officer badges on and it's wonderful And the one on the right right hand side, it looks exactly like that what I first started working with in the Barks business. Was working when I got out of college, and before I do my first story, And a district manager and the shoe store I worked Al he looked exactly like this guy. I was thought mister G has been just like this guy. Like he looks exactly like him even though he's a dog face. It's nice. That kinda lee guys and the

277
00:40:10,894 --> 00:40:11,932
very right. Mh.

278
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:22,590
I like how he he goes out of his way Barks does to, like, shrink the nephews down a little bit here. Yeah. They're they look like pray, basically

279
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,230
these big. And the true officers.

280
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,925
Right. And then So the last page of the story, it finally

281
00:40:30,385 --> 00:40:37,298
transitions to Donald, and we get sort of his inner interim monologue. He's He's been worrying about the kids.

282
00:40:37,637 --> 00:40:44,145
So he decides he's gonna go into the school house and check up on them in between his bucket deliveries, and

283
00:40:44,485 --> 00:41:31,442
he turns around to find them just a couple pieces behind him marching to school and and he says so you did play hook today, and they they admit yes, on Donald and I suppose you'll play hope again tomorrow. You wanna tell us how it ends. And they say no. Could be. And then behind the marching up going twelve pump pump the ground on the ground or all these true up so we found out it's too hard to do they. And it's a wonderful and It's it's amazing. It's silly, you know, but it's just so funny. Right. It's obviously over the top. There's no need for more than one or two of them to accompany them. But it's such a great image. It's something that I've never I've never seen before. It's just unusual.

284
00:41:32,018 --> 00:41:41,622
And it's it's very over the top. It's it's very funny. The too. So I really like this story I would say that this one is

285
00:41:42,278 --> 00:41:47,380
an example of an underrated story because I actually think it's quite a bit stronger

286
00:41:47,721 --> 00:42:05,307
than our last story. Which I I find to be a very good Barks story. Mh. Yeah. But I I think this one has a has a nice impact. It's got that great punch at the end. And it's kinda of fun to see the nephews who are usually kind of like, they have what you might call plot armor usually,

287
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:14,841
well bad things typically don't happen to them. Right. So it's kinda fun to see them putting that. Position. They get that they get their just desserts in this particular

288
00:42:15,195 --> 00:42:29,041
Right. And they do actually, like, deserve it. And so is very very neutral and this one doesn't like. Whole lot happens to Just Al a five standard or even the background tools Right. So our last story is the traveling t.

289
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:39,557
And this one is from almost exactly three years later, it has a cover date of October of fifty four. So let's see. We've got three stories

290
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:42,688
five years apart, basically.

291
00:42:43,147 --> 00:42:53,538
Mh. Right? So, like, that doesn't sound like a huge span of time, but Boy, you think about how much Carl Barks did? How many stories in that brief window?

292
00:42:54,416 --> 00:43:04,773
This one was in Walt Disney disease Conference and Stories number one hundred and sixty nine is quite well rated. It's got a seven point four out of ten. Which is good for number four hundred and eighteen.

293
00:43:05,086 --> 00:43:07,786
So, like, not an all time classic, but but definitely,

294
00:43:08,566 --> 00:43:09,646
remembered fond.

295
00:43:10,086 --> 00:43:37,122
By place sweet opener with the house boat situation in making a boat everybody can, like, enjoy thinking about doing that sort the thing is a kid. It's not Inducks opening background the background always amazing how car will jump around to doctor the various locations. You sometimes the snowing and duck they look Al, you know, the bottom of this page in the background. It's like, lush like like a very wet looking kind of like kind of an area like California ish, I guess, maybe Right.

296
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,653
Marsh. Yeah. Really interesting. And

297
00:43:41,405 --> 00:43:52,471
I think you're right too. The this this opening here where they're making their boat. It's a nice bit of wish fulfillment. It feels very like, feels Tom's Sawyer, again very classic American.

298
00:43:53,251 --> 00:44:02,880
And again, just like that previous story open up, there really just be moaning the fact that they have to go to school that they're facing down the first day tomorrow

299
00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:05,677
nine months of stuffy classrooms

300
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:17,369
And he really doubles down on them, you know, Think they out and need school. Because in this one they're saying what a waste of time and we already know more than most one you're were something go lesson for last.

301
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:18,464
Right.

302
00:44:18,903 --> 00:44:25,401
But in fact they have resolved that they're not gonna go to school. Yep they they want to set off

303
00:44:25,781 --> 00:44:27,401
on a life of adventure

304
00:44:27,701 --> 00:44:44,080
and and we transition at the end of the page over to Donald who does not know about their specific plans. The narrator box tells us. But was young ones himself? And so he's reading this book, it's got a a good little gag title. It's called child raising

305
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:47,975
by who can do it? Mh. The author.

306
00:44:48,454 --> 00:44:52,742
And he's in a section called forty ways to catch true Scrooge

307
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:56,052
children. So this is one of those battle of width.

308
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:56,456
Stories, Patrick. Yep And I like the next couple of pages. Why why do you tell us about they set up this escalating, you know, Donald attempts to keep them at and obviously, they're both on the ball. The kids are on the ball donuts own Al. They know it's but this is all about dogs tomorrow and the speak. Up early sharpen wet keen Bye. Fact, I'd better be on... Alert even sooner than that. Barks the door, so they can't get out... They think that's funny who do something old fashioned trying take out work. They had extra key. They loosen the glass in the window, and they've got like the rope going down into the attic case those two methods don't Barks they can escape. Al has got a chance of stopping us. They're just two up to date all the latest charges. I like Al the last panel the look how he stuff cotton the alarm clock. He wouldn't waking us up time to sneak away so child like shore uncle donald do it. I think they've got things going here. Right. I I like how the the setup almost feels like they're preparing to go into bad all the next day both sides.

309
00:45:57,271 --> 00:46:00,331
So the next morning, you know, we switched to Donald

310
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:05,946
perspective, and he finds their doors unlocked, and he says that he kinda expected that

311
00:46:06,605 --> 00:46:15,616
And and they've left a note, which again, he kind of expected that they'd be gone and and he'd expected that they run away from home but he

312
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:30,056
says that he had sprinkled ji some powder around the house to make their traps easy to follow. Kinda many little touch. Yeah. As a kid, I was wondering what G was. This like some. What is this stuff? Where is this? Like some sort of plaster?

313
00:46:30,576 --> 00:46:45,836
I didn't I have a clue it's the and news kind construction material in the little Right. Isn't it something that goes into isn't the dusty stuff that goes into plaster or something that's related plastic. Yeah I think it's yeah. People use the word. No. This says,

314
00:46:46,174 --> 00:46:49,721
it is the main cons stitching in many forms of class

315
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,880
black or sidewalk chop in drywall. It one.

316
00:46:54,341 --> 00:46:58,935
Barks mysteries as a kid for me. He uses that work quite bit. Yeah. So

317
00:46:59,312 --> 00:47:08,440
he is able to follow them. We get we get like the visual of the footprints, but it's actually convincing because Barks says, you know, created

318
00:47:09,336 --> 00:47:13,005
justification for it. And he tracks them to where they launch their boat,

319
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:26,438
calling them mighty Clever boys. They've been building the boat for days so they could sneak away without leaving a trail. I like Patrick, how he's like almost proud of them, you know, he's kinda smiling to himself. My likes this challenge.

320
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:59,250
Yeah. These doesn't seem to be worried. No it doesn't. You wanna tell us about how he track him down? Well, know that the the boats can have so they're not gonna go up wherever where. They're gonna go down. So he's been look down river it takes his car, and there's a nice shot of him on a bridge. If you could see them heading towards the bridge and little but it. I always enjoy these stories that have something like that that carry through from different angles and like sydney. The most be business it's drawing to the story like this. It's fun thing to carry that through the different angles and you kind of wanted to think of whatever is you're doing. It's three d ninety

321
00:47:59,709 --> 00:48:00,209
inside.

322
00:48:00,548 --> 00:48:14,627
So he says he could go and grab them, but it'll be welcome on to teach them lesson. And he's got a whole, like a whole diving outfit there with and he's going out even more than they and he as a drill with the old fashioned hand with the z, I can put a damp into to the rash.

323
00:48:15,522 --> 00:48:26,043
Typically wonderful Barks expired day benz or the rash power right and width for. So we see them under the water, and they're fishing They don't know what's gonna happen. Until all of a sudden

324
00:48:26,395 --> 00:48:41,802
They're both springs holes and received it vote his developed guise. It's sinking Grandma more duff in abandoned ship but he's still down their drilling holes. So and ends less and number one. Right. He's sc their beautiful little boat, what does shit take long.

325
00:48:42,674 --> 00:48:56,400
So they're forced to seek refuge on this little san Barks Island, and and they've gotta try and light a fire to warm up and while they're doing this. Donald is gonna take his time to, like, keep his

326
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,240
lesson

327
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,020
going.

328
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,131
He ends up, he ends up getting a stuffed lion

329
00:49:02,508 --> 00:49:05,321
and he's contracted with a pilot

330
00:49:05,658 --> 00:49:10,920
to seed the clouds, you know, shades of Rain maker, Donald. Our master rain maker,

331
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,840
which I guess would still be...

332
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:23,975
Oh, he's done it by at this point, hi. He's already had that for. Well anyway, this is the second time that he's gonna do some rain making here and and full... And basically,

333
00:49:24,609 --> 00:49:49,603
leave the boys getting rained on cold and wet. And finally, they resolved that they can and that the lion will also have taken refuge so so they consider themselves beat and they head home. And as they approach their front door, donald has gone a little bit too far. Al us that. There is a note on the door when you get home, and the note says, I have gone to Afghanistan to forget my

334
00:49:50,142 --> 00:49:53,873
by my friend's donald dot They're like, very upset to crying,

335
00:49:54,273 --> 00:50:03,219
dogs and mcdonald's gone away. And we haven't got a home anymore. It's all our fault. And he's like it's very funny it's hiding behind edge of the house. Right into wow jesus.

336
00:50:04,677 --> 00:50:10,991
Yeah. Because he's broken their Spirit pretty quickly in this story. This is how Barks Joke a little bit in this one.

337
00:50:12,203 --> 00:50:18,890
Where he's gonna... He's gonna give them a little bit of a scare. He's not gonna reveal himself. And when he finally finishes

338
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:19,729
his

339
00:50:20,187 --> 00:50:25,955
soda at the fountain and returns. He finds a note from them on top of his.

340
00:50:26,834 --> 00:50:29,492
Selling like they're but Yeah. It's very comic

341
00:50:30,151 --> 00:50:30,651
misspelled

342
00:50:31,484 --> 00:50:32,542
dear people,

343
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:48,469
we have gone to Al Gladstone stand two, we want to be with our uncle donald good by Kiwi Louis and Dewey dot, and he's got this, like, shocked expression on his face realizing that he's He's just set himself up for another

344
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:51,620
chase, but with much of higher steaks now.

345
00:50:52,317 --> 00:51:03,535
And so For the second time that day, he has to charter a flight this time from a helicopter to help him look This is gonna be an expensive series of lessons room. Certain news.

346
00:51:04,315 --> 00:51:07,935
So he has the pilot circle to keep an eye out for him.

347
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:15,310
But a storm comes up, so he has him touched set them down on a farm, and Donald gets himself

348
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:20,870
caught up the top of a well corner by what he thinks to be a bowl

349
00:51:21,345 --> 00:51:22,485
And he just... He's

350
00:51:22,945 --> 00:51:28,260
pretty pathetic here. All he can do is, like, call for help. To be done with him going to help help

351
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:32,210
it's got that sketchy kind of thing. Not exactly. So

352
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:39,185
wet it's not black. It's like going and sweet. Really pretty. Yeah. This really pretty has really nice sense depth too.

353
00:51:40,105 --> 00:51:52,665
And and so we transition back to the nephews you wanna tell us about that. So they're in the truck And wonder of this truck is going. I don't know. I even lost track and where it's been quiet. The driver will hear us And they hear a faith voice

354
00:51:53,204 --> 00:52:02,265
yelling from inside the truck and they have to investigate themselves and it jump out because it's going slow west coming from our field. The wall has somebody tree. That's no ball getaway away by.

355
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:04,538
Going like

356
00:52:04,957 --> 00:52:16,505
well. And that's how we know. Right? Because they call it boss, which is good nickname for cow. And so, you know, the docks have to, like, t off together, but it turns out that Donald is lost

357
00:52:16,845 --> 00:52:21,328
two. Because he didn't keep track. He can keep good track of where he was going.

358
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:24,779
When the Nephews pointed out, the name of the county,

359
00:52:25,316 --> 00:52:33,865
the the county name is pretty... It's it's it's two things. Right? It's got... It's not a term that we don't use anymore for a native American woman,

360
00:52:34,245 --> 00:52:37,879
which would have been in common use of the time, but then it's also bun

361
00:52:38,217 --> 00:52:41,568
which is pretty funny implying but it's like, really far out there.

362
00:52:42,565 --> 00:52:44,995
So when he's talking about the name of the county.

363
00:52:45,335 --> 00:52:47,395
Donald is revealing that he

364
00:52:47,735 --> 00:52:48,955
himself played h

365
00:52:49,295 --> 00:52:56,683
so often and he doesn't know his local geography. Huey, a little geography. Yeah. Right. And

366
00:52:57,021 --> 00:53:04,922
finally, in the morning, you know, they have a wet and miserable night the mary box tells us, and they they eventually find an emergency

367
00:53:05,301 --> 00:53:05,801
phone

368
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:38,184
where Donald is able to make a call and ask where he's calling from, and he's told that it's from a public phone on Lonely lee Lane. And how does the story close out, Patrick? Donald in the phone both he's fine. And know one tell you the Duck True officer to come out here and get some ducks that need to go to school awfully way back and the closing gag is includes himself in school with them because of his bad job. Don't look so surprised. When I said some ducks that need to go to school, and that need to. That's little thing at the end little surprise.

369
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:44,138
Then look Al sound of these Scrooge also set. You all the fees subject? That's it's a nice little

370
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:49,327
as you say a surprise gap. Right? Where we... It converts our expectations

371
00:53:49,785 --> 00:54:13,025
One of the one of the reasons this stuff is great. See with never... Like, a lot of people, if I was wearing the story, I probably have the Scrooge don't put them in school. But he the car will always take an extra bit. Do want people to know beforehand, what was gonna go, try surprise you always at the end something special some little thing that need to make sense, but you wouldn't think it does hear in the little ways. To small. Yeah. And it kinda sets up this nice cam

372
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:17,968
between domino's nephews that's nice. It's a very satisfying yeah. And

373
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,815
balances out the beginning thing where they're both thinking the on top world knowledge and they both

374
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:24,873
hiv.

375
00:54:25,273 --> 00:54:27,611
Probably And at the end, they're equal their.

376
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:46,375
Yeah, You're right because like both sides have been full of blu. And and that's usually who Bark will deflate at the end. Whichever side is like full of themselves. Yep. And and it it was both of them at the beginning. And and Patrick look at this, we've had... We've had three stories in this relatively

377
00:54:46,835 --> 00:55:49,680
brief span from Barb, you know, he he went back to this well a couple of times because it was a good topic. But these stories are very unique. They they all end in very different ways. Yeah. I don't feel that one steps on the other in any way. All three of them but and they're Al different enough that they don't feel like the same topic at Al. Yeah. Exactly. And know like, Barks could be forgiven for having... You know, he he did hundreds of these stories. We know that every once in a while he would repurpose one of his stories. You have to imagine some of the very late ones, you know, it doesn't get away with it quite as well. Right. In the sixties, but at this point, he could really do me wrong. He can revisit things and they're still fresh. Somehow. I feel like even when he revisit, he he does It does a nice job of, like, doing a different take on it. And there's really honestly not that many of those. I don't think But this is just a neat. I I think A neat opportunity to see these three different takes on this same subject in in in the ten page

378
00:55:50,178 --> 00:55:53,826
I am struck by how how incredibly old fashioned

379
00:55:54,282 --> 00:55:58,025
all of these feel. Yep You know, how very, like, classic

380
00:55:58,402 --> 00:55:58,902
American.

381
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,296
I mean, kids still play hockey.

382
00:56:01,634 --> 00:56:11,107
Right? But it's it's definitely... No... No kids or generally gonna sneak off unless you're in a very rural area, I guess to to go fish.

383
00:56:11,546 --> 00:56:19,120
Well, yeah you know, back here at this point in time. You know, the I guess the Scrooge was worried about kids not going to school. Today they have on the guardians.

384
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:24,200
So it's changed but it's there's still a security thing going on it's different

385
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:31,000
looking at a different problem. Right. Yeah. You've gotta imagine too, like, just the the whole idea of compulsory

386
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:46,613
education it didn't happen all at once. Right? Like a lot earlier in American history, you were not required to go to school. So, I guess it's natural that but eventually, they would figure out. We need... We need a system in place to, like, get kids to school.

387
00:56:47,070 --> 00:57:12,171
And then nowadays, no one really... We don't need true officers is at least in the same way that that they used to... There's a lot of less of definition being school that doesn't require build. So much of scores online now. They come home and be work and you don't have a box they do. It's like right. The lines board between school and much more than. Yeah. So that... I I I definitely recommend

388
00:57:12,588 --> 00:57:15,122
people checking out these stories. They're all...

389
00:57:15,459 --> 00:57:32,030
They're all very worth while. I would say, I think that the the first of them probably is my favorite by just a little bit. Mh. I really like the setup with that, you know, and how it's really about the kind of the spy element of it feels very cool. Plus it is the youtube and yes.

390
00:57:32,888 --> 00:57:35,280
Yeah. The that they're all very strong stories

391
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:43,000
I should mention... I guess, before we wrap it up, I should mention that Barks had a pretty cool oil painting

392
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,200
right, of

393
00:57:44,755 --> 00:57:55,917
Did you do a couple of whale paintings for more... I think that there might have been more than one version. One was very early thing. Pleased tomatoes a really super early. One of this, like, nineteen seventy something one early.

394
00:57:56,596 --> 00:57:56,796
Right.

395
00:57:57,475 --> 00:58:03,262
I'm thinking I... I'm I'm looking... I brought it up right now. I like the one where they're they're fishing

396
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:10,970
casually just across the state line. Mh. That's... That's one of his great gag things, I think. So

397
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:20,458
let's see. And do that... Do you have any other thoughts about these three cool stories? It's... They're all within, like, the best period,

398
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:31,900
generally, the best curls best years. And it's interesting to see him like from stories of when you look at all three stories back to back I can wait, especially, we really get a sense of how cold calls

399
00:58:32,215 --> 00:58:33,575
style slowly changed.

400
00:58:34,175 --> 00:58:54,910
We're almost weird here, you could see, like, in getting like, more and more confidence than the first sorry to the second story in the drawing physical job. And the third story is doing it's it's like carrying on and still is dexter stove look really good and he's more didn't like lighter, you know, lighter handed about composing panels and their loser again. More like they were earlier again. So

401
00:58:55,569 --> 00:58:59,701
it's a nice three stories Are really nice to look at from artist perspective the same.

402
00:59:00,758 --> 00:59:22,463
Well said, I I love hearing your perspective, you know, Al a doc card is because you always point out. These things that I... I'm not, like is keyed into. But I I really appreciate you joining me for this one. Was fun. There more fun that I thought it would be. You I. The three ten pages Scrooge like would like you can be okay? I really enjoyed it just looking at the true back to Barks like this I really like

403
00:59:22,921 --> 00:59:32,454
looking at the Barks stories them. I think this is a fun opportunity to really consider that this good three fix Excellent. Alright. Well, listeners,

404
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:37,355
