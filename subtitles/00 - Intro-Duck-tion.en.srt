00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:33,804
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks, the podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge McDuck and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comics of all time.

2
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:39,130
Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological publishing order.

3
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:45,163
We'll talk about what makes them so enduring, their historical context and how well they hold up today.

4
00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:48,621
So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks.

5
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,835
So welcome. This is Barks remarks.

6
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:59,607
And I am Mark. I am a longtime Carl Barks fan.

7
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:11,025
This is gonna be our introductory, our episode zero, where we talk about what it is I'm hoping to do,

8
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:21,340
And give a little bit of background and structure for the rest of the episodes and the mission of Barks remarks

9
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:31,193
is that I am hoping to with the help of some guests talk about impressions and backgrounds

10
00:01:31,193 --> 00:01:37,710
for all of the Carl Barks, Uncle Scrooge and Donald Duck adventure stories.

11
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:41,996
So these would be the long format stories.

12
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:56,260
Barks fans know that there are hundreds of stories. Most of them are the ten page gag comics that populated like Walt Disney's products and stories.

13
00:01:57,153 --> 00:02:07,000
But in this podcast, again, we're going to be going over the stories that range and length that they're generally around twenty pages.

14
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:18,164
And again, I wanna do this chronologically and talk about how those Carl Barks, Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge stories have evolved.

15
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:23,349
I as I mentioned, I am a long Barks fan.

16
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:33,108
I've been reading the stories since I was a child of probably about 7, back in 1987.

17
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:40,510
So I have that perspective as a long time fan, really an obsessive,

18
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:51,826
but I am going to be bringing on guests and they are going to be taking the role of someone who is a more casual Barks fan

19
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:59,720
or sometimes someone who is not familiar. So I'd like to take a moment to introduce my guests today.

20
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,829
- My name is Eric. I'm a friend of Marc's. I have been a lifelong comic reader from my brothers,

21
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:10,705
older brothers collecting comics.

22
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:19,796
My exposure to what Disney comics was from as a kid my dad would always buy them as reading material for family road trips

23
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:25,558
because those comics are great, it's great for sharing and passing around a van full of kids.

24
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:29,645
So we can all take a turn and read it. If you like it, get it back later.

25
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:34,914
But that's what things I loved about those comics as a kid, particularly the Disney ones,

26
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:40,882
cause you could just read those and reread even if there's just one story, you don't have to go and collect all the rest of them.

27
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:51,279
But I mean, I grew up reading Donald Duck. I've never recognized Carl Barks as the illustrator but I've been like, oh, okay, I've seen this before.

28
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:54,760
I think you gave a couple issues...

29
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,858
- Tell me, what do you know about Carl Barks?

30
00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:02,911
Well, from Carl Barks, I've learned a lot from reading...

31
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:04,587
So, Don Rosa's work.

32
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:12,293
I'm sure I've read some of in the past. But like i said, I'm not the biggest identifier of art and illustrators when it comes with comics.

33
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:15,342
I grew up a lot on Ducktales, the cartoon,

34
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:23,705
and reading about them and not really like like, oh okay. And realizing that Barks was a lot of the inspiration

35
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:28,424
for a lot of the classic Ducktales stories. That it was like, okay.

36
00:04:28,424 --> 00:04:34,308
- Right. You are a kid in the eighties like I was. So obviously, we watched Ducktales.

37
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:43,820
I know I was hugely into Ducktales tales, and I I do want to talk a little bit about Ducktales in the course of the podcast.

38
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:51,811
The focus is gonna be mostly on the Barks stories, but a lot of them did inspire those cartoons as well as the reboot.

39
00:04:52,470 --> 00:05:00,419
I know that they're kind of a touchy subject with some Barks fans because some Barks fans don't feel like they did them,

40
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,779
you know, they that they did them a disservice. But I I think they're fun cartoons.

41
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,694
So while it's not what I want to talk the most to about. Definitely wanna talk about those stories yeah.

42
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:14,851
And sometimes other pop culture references...

43
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:15,808
- Sure.

44
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:20,096
- ... That might have come out about from those,

45
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:27,164
because a lot of people in pop culture, I think have been influenced by Barks.

46
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:29,984
So Mark, as a child of the 80s,

47
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:36,071
Carl Barks being such an older, you know... cause they were printed back in the 40s, the 50s...

48
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:39,595
As a child of the 80s, how did you get exposure to these comics?

49
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:52,224
Well, I wish I could tell you exactly. I do remember the first issue that I got, and I feel like it was just in a generic, like 7-11 news stand or something.

50
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:58,436
But Gladstone, the company that published them in the 80s,

51
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:06,609
they picked up the license after a period of inactivity, and they started running those Barks reprints.

52
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:14,685
And I know that they started running the Don Rosa stories as well and the William Van Horn stories.

53
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:20,046
And it was an episode, an issue rather of Uncle Scrooge.

54
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:28,042
The one where he has... you know what, I'm spacing on the story right now, I'll have to go back and look it up.

55
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:36,704
But it was just a couple of months actually before I got into Ducktales, so I did get into the comics just a little bit before Ducktales

56
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:43,180
and then was just so excited to come home from school and watch those.

57
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:53,106
But that's how I got into Carl Barks, and it sounds like you had just kind of found it organically, but didn't necessarily know who he was.

58
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:58,716
Was it through me that you learned who the good artist was?

59
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:04,944
I don't think Don Rosa would argue with you on that, that's the funny part.

60
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:12,768
And I may have seen the name around. I mean, I know it's sounded familiar but putting the... Putting it all together.

61
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:19,078
I don't think I did until you came around. But when you did, like, oh, okay. Yeah. I remember those stories.

62
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:30,084
- Yeah. And they do stand out. And and I call him the good artist, the good duck artist because that's how he became known to fans originally.

63
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:40,439
And so, you know, I think we should definitely take a moment for the purpose of this podcast to just ask who the heck is Carl Barks,

64
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:50,108
and why would he be important enough to devote what promises to be a pretty lengthy, and long running podcast about him.

65
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:59,041
And Carl Barks, you would probably know him best is the creator of Uncle Scrooge, right? That's kind of his claim to fame.

66
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:11,900
Carl Barks is famous for having done hundreds of, as I mentioned before, a mix of gag comics, featuring, Uncle Scrooge, as well as Donald Duck.

67
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:19,042
A number of other Disney characters, including some of whom became very famous

68
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:24,165
and well known to Disney that he actually created.

69
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:37,224
And he was not very well known originally when he started in the forties, he worked pretty anonymously,

70
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:44,857
which was kind of the Disney style at the time, you know, these new stand comics, they didn't really have room for anyone's credit

71
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,250
other than Walt Disney himself,

72
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:59,165
but comic book fans... and it's important I think to appreciate just how huge comic books were in the gold and silver age of comics.

73
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:04,836
I mean, millions of readers were paying a dime at the drugstore for these comics.

74
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:11,364
And Disney was huge. It still is, but I I think it probably was much bigger back then.

75
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:17,606
There were fewer of these types of stories around. They didn't have their long history.

76
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:28,435
So these comics were massive, and fans really started to differentiate the quality of some of these stories and the art style.

77
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:38,709
And among casual fans, these hundreds of stories became recognized as the ones that were done by "the good artist".

78
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:54,931
And much later into his career, Carl Barks did start to get credit for them and a community of fans really formed around appreciating and enjoying these stories.

79
00:09:56,465 --> 00:10:01,407
And and I think it's really interesting that it was really done kind of retroactively.

80
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:07,930
Like, there was this huge body of of these comics and and then later generations like me,

81
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:17,855
were discovering them only through reprints, and then as they became adapted into the different TV shows.

82
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:35,212
So I think it's really neat how they kind of span the years and that they just stood, such a test of time that they could overcome that obscurity. that Barks worked in.

83
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:44,855
And Carl Barks got a lot of recognition in his later years, you know, he was made... Disney has their their designation of Disney legends.

84
00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:53,561
He was made at Disney legend, and a lot of fans and collectors really enjoy not only the comics,

85
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:58,838
you know, they they seek out the comics, but in his later years, the last couple of decades,

86
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:03,208
it might have been longer than he actually worked on the comics himself.

87
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:13,716
He did some really spectacular oil paintings that are just a very hot property these days.

88
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:18,870
They're very valuable collectibles and really cool.

89
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:25,517
And they've been released as lithographic reproductions and and there's been a variety of figurines.

90
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:39,828
And again, you know, just a really long history of many, many stories over many decades spanning a ton of different comic book publishers.

91
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:50,554
I mentioned,  Eric, some of the the characters... that he's become famous for inventing a lot of characters.

92
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:59,838
Who comes to mind as far as you know? And if you get some wrong, fine. But do you know who he's created?

93
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:07,727
In the Duck universe? Or in the Disney Universe in general?
- In the Duck universe.
- Obviously Scrooge.
- Right.

94
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:14,716
Donald obviously was not one of his... I don't believe the nephews were either.

95
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:21,355
I'd imagine... I'd imagine Gladstone Gander was...
- Yeah. Gladstone Gander is a creation of his.

96
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:28,225
- And let's see if Donald...
- I don't mean to put you on the spot. He's got some recognizable

97
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:32,926
characters.
- No, sure. I'm trying to think of the various ones.

98
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:42,333
I can't remember all the family names...
- His villains are pretty well known.
- His what? His villains.

99
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:51,600
Oh, his villains. Both, yeah. Of course. That's gonna be... Fintheart?
- Yes.
- Magica de Spell?
- Yep.

100
00:12:53,215 --> 00:13:06,785
Trying to think...
- The Beagle Boys.
- The Beagle Boys, yes.
- And a lot of the lore around Scrooge, you know, how we think of Scrooge...

101
00:13:07,282 --> 00:13:10,894
He created him, but he also created just the idea.

102
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:22,146
- The Myth.
- The myth, yes.
- "Tougher than the toughies, smarter than the smarties", "You made it square"...
- Yeah, that's right.

103
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:32,621
The famous working for a dime with the whole shoe shine in Scotland, and then had to go to America to seek his fortune, even that wasn't easy.

104
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:42,420
but because he was so cheap he had the money to buy everything

105
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:50,885
and his business empire exploded through the the great depression is what I imagine they've been framed as.

106
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:57,366
- Right. And I think a lot of that story fillin- in probably we came about through some of the don stories

107
00:13:57,366 --> 00:14:06,154
- That makes sense. That makes sense. But just the famous... The explorer of explorers, you know, he was this fancy duck.

108
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:11,954
So he sustained his business through economics, but he extended it through adventuring.

109
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:14,689
- Yes. I think that's a good description.

110
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:24,664
A lot of the kind of icons of Scrooge McDuck were created by Barks too, Right? The idea of the money bin...

111
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:36,949
Scrooge is like an avatar for wealth and greed, and rolling in money... that was created by Barks; the number one dime was created by him.

112
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:41,689
All that... Everything around that.

113
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:45,242
So I think there's a lot to talk about.

114
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:56,280
I'd like to just kind of go a little bit through some of the structure of what I like to do in each podcast before wrapping things up.

115
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,310
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna be talking about each story.

116
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:06,592
We're not gonna delve too deeply into summarizing the story.

117
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,958
But, you know, I do one off up a good synopsis.

118
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:18,484
Eric is raising up his very appropriate Donald Duck Disneyland shirt. So I had to give them appreciative chuckle.

119
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:27,297
Oh and I I should've have worn my one Uncle Scrooge shirt, but I'll be podcast appropriate next time.

120
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:35,540
So in each podcast, we're gonna talk about story of course. We're gonna talk about an overview of what happens.

121
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:45,112
But for me, a big part of why these stories are so appealing apart from the great art and the interesting plots,

122
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:49,249
is everything that I learned from them.

123
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:58,896
I often joke that so much of my knowledge of geography and mythology and the sciences...

124
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:04,858
And a lot of really interesting vocabulary came about through reading these comics,

125
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:15,595
And it's weird too because so many of them took place 30 and 40 years before I was born. So sometimes I have I feel like very specific knowledge of pop culture.

126
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:26,047
From that period.
- Sure. The historical knowledge that was brought in by those, was so very interesting and neat as a kid.

127
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:31,191
Because, you know, back in the 80s you didn't have the Internet skills to just, you know, look through things you didn't have...

128
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:36,553
"There's a sort of urban legend from South America about a man made of gold", you know...

129
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:41,760
And it was these interesting things that just expanded your vision of the world.

130
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:47,983
So very much more interesting, more intellectually interesting, than reading another,

131
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:53,745
you know, than the Archie comics you know...

132
00:16:54,403 --> 00:17:00,590
- And I definitely agree, but I am gonna cough to having had a pretty big Archie comics collection as a kid.

133
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:13,960
- And I've read those, but the Duck stories have a lasting effect: [...] the square chickens...

134
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,279
- Oh, yes.

135
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:18,272
- You know, these are things that were just amazing.

136
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,828
If you read one Archie comic, you read them all.

137
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:28,099
Scrooge and the ducks are very different. They take you around the globe.

138
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:32,879
- They opened me up to to a lot of different cultures and legends.

139
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:35,792
In a really interesting way. But...

140
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:44,159
I do wanna to talk kind of about the critical consensus. You know, you mentioned square chickens and square eggs.

141
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,700
That's from lost in the Andes, which of course is one of the best regarded.

142
00:17:50,754 --> 00:18:00,226
Not all of these stories are noted equally. So, you know, I'd love to talk about what make some of them hold up better than others.

143
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:09,475
I definitely don't want to shy away either from the fact that, you know, some of them really don't hold up.

144
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:14,247
These these are definitely products of their time.

145
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:23,394
Carl Barks was born, I believe in 1900 exactly.

146
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:33,169
And, you know, Uncle Scrooge is definitely kind of one of the prototypical imperialist.

147
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,129
He's an Uber capitalist.

148
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:44,706
And there's a lot of baggage that goes along with that. So, you know, I'm not here to cancel Carl Barks.

149
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:53,770
Or anything like that. I definitely am coming at this from the perspective of a super fan who loves these stories.

150
00:18:54,583 --> 00:19:00,387
And loves to celebrate them. But I also don't wanna shy away from some of the very dated aspects.

151
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:13,439
So we'll take a little bit of time to kind of reflect during these episodes of podcasts on what does and does not hold up well.

152
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:21,396
- Can I ask a question, Mark?
- Yeah, shoot.
- Alright. So he's born in 1900, he started printing in his late 40s and 50s.

153
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:26,005
That's telling me : it's not too late for us to start our cartooning careers.

154
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:30,280
I think that is a great insight. It's never too late.

155
00:19:31,814 --> 00:19:42,484
Yeah. Boy, he didn't start painting until his 60s, a whole second career for him. He was a late bloomer.

156
00:19:43,063 --> 00:19:49,046
And you're absolutely right. He did a lot too before the Carl Barks stories...

157
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:54,085
I mean before the Donald Ducks and Uncle Scrooge stories.

158
00:19:55,536 --> 00:20:05,207
And I'm not planning to talk too much about his early career in the main episodes. But you know, I I have ponder the possibility

159
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:15,339
that maybe there might be bonus episodes where we talk about some of the other stuff that he did for publications like the "Calgary eye opener"

160
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:26,327
or the work he did with Barney Bear, which I've never actually read personally, so maybe I shouldn't admit that.
- I haven't even heard of it.

161
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:35,439
- And then, you know, there are some really spectacular gag comics and ten pagers.

162
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:37,899
I do have a lot of love for those.

163
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:50,074
So even though I'm planning to make the canon episodes of this about the adventure stories, given a loose definition, because some are just longer stories...

164
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:56,930
But, you know, there might be room to pick a few of those for some bonus episode or something. We'll see how it goes.

165
00:20:57,427 --> 00:21:01,010
So I'm really excited to do this, Eric.

166
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,999
I'm really grateful to you for being in the first guest

167
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:19,113
I'm looking forward to having you back to talk about the first of the actual official number one episode of the podcast

168
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:25,265
where we're gonna be talking about "Donald Duck finds pirate gold".

169
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:29,859
It's going to be the very first one we talked about.

170
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:38,994
He did do an earlier Disney story, "Pluto saves the ship", I think, but, you know, it's not really in keeping with the others.

171
00:21:39,754 --> 00:21:51,207
And in a lot of ways, "Donald Duck finds pirate gold" is not either its own creation, but it'll be interesting talking about that in our our first official episode.

172
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:59,322
So I hope to hear from you and I look forward to to any thoughts that people might have.

173
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:07,600
I don't yet have any kind of specific social media designated to get listener feedback,

174
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,249
but I would be shocked if there wasn't any listener feedback until we're a couple of podcasts in.

175
00:22:13,587 --> 00:22:18,297
So I'm sure I'll get a Gmail account where people can reach out.

176
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:30,882
Eric, any closing thoughts about what you're excited for in, you know, coming back and hopefully being a repeat guest for Barks remarks?

177
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,655
Well, I mean, I'm a big fan of Scrooge.

178
00:22:35,132 --> 00:22:37,567
And he's always been one of the characters I identify with the most.

179
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:44,933
And those adventure stories are classics in my mind. Those the kind of stories I love as a kid.

180
00:22:45,412 --> 00:22:50,941
So like a chance to discuss them the very simple good versus evil,

181
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:56,319
plucky heroes, classic stage villains [?] scenery...

182
00:22:56,699 --> 00:23:07,014
It's so great, and I love it so much. And I look forward to talking about them and if anything just reliving some of those comics and some of those stories,

183
00:23:07,014 --> 00:23:14,408
from when I was a kid. I definitely want to do it
-  Yeah, it's been a while since I've read many of them, they've just been in boxes.

184
00:23:14,408 --> 00:23:17,021
So this is a great excuse to pull them out.

185
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:25,744
And I hope people will listen.... I've joked with you that I expect literally dozens of Scandinavians to listen to these.

186
00:23:26,244 --> 00:23:36,466
But I really hope people that choose to listen willl read along and maybe re-discover something about these stories.

187
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:42,814
So we'll look forward to coming on again and take care everyone.

188
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:43,994
- Bye.
