00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,695
Hello. I'm Mark Sever marino, a grown man who enjoys donald dot comics,

3
00:00:54,353 --> 00:01:00,659
and I'm joined by another grown person who I've managed to convince to let me talk about said comics.

4
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,992
You can introduce yourself.

5
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,527
Hi. I'm Sarah Santiago.

6
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,980
I am from Phoenix, but I'm currently living in

7
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,300
the land of Scrooge Mc

8
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,080
Scotland.

9
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:17,104
Yeah. Very exciting. Maybe we can get you back to talk about

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,094
Scottish set one. But Be cool.

11
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:24,237
But today, we are here to talk about the Barks

12
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:25,196
story,

13
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:29,825
Volcano Valley and I know that we both have some

14
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:32,385
strong thoughts about this one.

15
00:01:33,805 --> 00:01:34,305
So

16
00:01:35,085 --> 00:01:40,556
let's see. Before we get into it, Sarah, can I ask you what your background

17
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:42,829
is in comics.

18
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:45,541
I have very little background and comics.

19
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:49,384
It turns out that I have a problem with tasks switching

20
00:01:49,922 --> 00:02:02,400
between visual and vertical. And so every time I tried to read a comic, I would just get really confused and not know what was going on. And it wasn't until my mid thirties that I figured up that was going on.

21
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:18,531
Which makes me very sad because it is such an excellent medium and there are so many stories that I just have people tell me. So this is not like unusual. I will sit people down and say please tell me this story about Deadpool and this.

22
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:20,047
And then I'll just listen

23
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:32,575
because I want to... I want to consume the stories. I just can't do it in the medium and so I have a translator. So you like you like the story and the art, but maybe separately. Yeah.

24
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:35,922
Well, we can we can look at those separately

25
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,227
in in this because this is a podcast. So, you know, we've got

26
00:02:41,564 --> 00:02:51,015
an auditory medium to talk about something that's very visual. So that should be a good challenge. So it sounds like you you like some of the superhero stuff even if you don't read it directly.

27
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:53,048
I I do.

28
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:59,060
And I did I did read... I so I used to be a part of a podcast called educating Geek.

29
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:03,206
And it was instead of saying, oh, well, you haven't

30
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:04,802
seen red

31
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:14,760
whatever this, you're not a real geek. We would turn that on his head and say, oh, you haven't seen red heard whatever. Let me introduce it to you. So I was introduced...

32
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:22,625
To the sand man, which is not a good comic to be introduced to if you don't understand how to navigate

33
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,320
through the medium

34
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,560
yourself, but I loved it. And I'm so excited that I get to consume the story

35
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:38,355
in, like, a movie Tv show. I can't remember what how that's being felt, but I'm really excited for that to come out. Yeah. Something look forward to.

36
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:44,070
Alright. Well, as mentioned, we are talking about volcano Valley and we

37
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:51,270
at Barb remarks, we start off with Al little bit of background about the story. This comic was published in

38
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:57,504
the cover date is May of nineteen forty seven. I guess that means it's actually April forty seven.

39
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:09,334
In the old series four color, number one hundred and forty seven, it's been reprinted a number of times. And this one is one of the longer ones, actually. This one is thirty pages.

40
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:14,389
For a brief synopsis, this one involves Donald accidentally

41
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:18,335
buying what turns out to be a real plane,

42
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:22,260
believing it to be a worse surplus model for the Nephews use.

43
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:27,735
And he quickly sells it to a g from the fictional country of Vol

44
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:32,148
joins him on a plane ride and basically gets stranded

45
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:34,083
in that backwards country.

46
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:40,344
There's Al lot more to it than that and we'll we'll get into that in our summary soon. But

47
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:41,979
a little bit more background

48
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:43,176
and trivia.

49
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:44,891
This one saw

50
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:46,766
it was rep

51
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:59,517
in a kind of an unconventional format. I think in the late sixties as a... A whitman big little book. I'm not very familiar with those, but saw that when researching it. And then

52
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:04,701
in reading about Barks, something that comes up a lot is that

53
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:05,977
he

54
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,706
he wrote a lot of these

55
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:11,992
far flung adventure stories in foreign lands,

56
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,204
largely based on his readings of national

57
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:16,121
geographic

58
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:22,888
and is is widely known to not have really traveled very much until much later in his career.

59
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:25,819
But because he was based in southern California,

60
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:26,834
you know,

61
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:28,529
from his Disney

62
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:33,330
animation days, he did make it across the border into Mexico for day trips.

63
00:05:34,182 --> 00:05:34,682
So

64
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:47,669
I think that may have given him some background for this one, but honestly, I don't think the depictions of the characters in this one or they're probably not based on those visits. They're more based on some

65
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:50,189
pretty widely held stereotypes

66
00:05:51,024 --> 00:06:06,211
of that time, things like speedy gonzalez and and so forth. I did find the value range for this one. There was documented sale of a nine point four grade, which is a very good condition for seven thousand two hundred and fifty dollars.

67
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:12,698
Alright. So you know what? Sarah, I feel the need to kinda take a moment

68
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:14,456
and acknowledge

69
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:15,295
that

70
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:26,931
I don't feel very warm and inclined towards this one, and I don't think you do either. It's... You're in the newbie seat. Today and it's it's a shame in a way

71
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,686
to to introduce you to Barks with this one because

72
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:39,601
I don't have a lot of love for this one. I... I'm gonna go out of my way to find some things that I like about it, but

73
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:45,393
I i am got... I actually did have fun with this. The the the content

74
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:59,643
it was funny. And of course, it's funny because this is not happening right outside, you know, our doors. So it's it's funny to laugh at how racist they were in nineteen forty seven. I did

75
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:00,522
though

76
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:03,156
enjoy the depictions of the volcanoes.

77
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:10,031
Because I did go to school for geology and my husband who's a morph volcano pathologist. And right now,

78
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:13,141
I spend most of my time watching

79
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:16,548
livestream streams of of Volcano and Iceland on Youtube.

80
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:21,856
So I we had some really good discussions in Our house last night about

81
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:25,746
versus Al acidic versus

82
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:36,134
and what so means so versus potassium and and all that's kind of stuff. It turns out that there's some value in the volcano storyline line.

83
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:38,235
I'd agree. I think

84
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:40,894
I I really like the high concept.

85
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:50,214
A volcano valley itself if we're getting past some of the stereotypes. And I I I do wanna agree with you right away. I I

86
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:53,525
ent the Internet, you know, it's not too hard

87
00:07:53,983 --> 00:08:05,024
to find people who will defend this. Story. Right? Because for for the kind of the reasons they usually do, and I I get where people are coming from, but

88
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:10,686
you know, we'll we'll go into why I I don't consider this one very redeem

89
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:15,126
in a way that that I do it or some of the other problematic,

90
00:08:15,783 --> 00:08:16,762
Barks stories,

91
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,514
that this one's kinda unique, but

92
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:26,310
I don't want to... I don't wanna go too hard on it because there is a there there are some fun moments

93
00:08:27,524 --> 00:08:32,467
and some some good humor in this one. So talking about some of the background,

94
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:36,419
you know, we can kinda split this into, like, historical versus

95
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:40,430
geographical this time versus geological which is which is fine.

96
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,337
I mentioned this was released in

97
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:45,091
nineteen forty seven,

98
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:49,415
and i... I'm gonna think of this kind of as the era of worse surplus.

99
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,426
Right? As the war wound down,

100
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:58,891
this is something that there's this plot point of the the ducks buying something accidentally

101
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:04,330
as worse surplus that turns out to be a full on plane. And this is a trope that I've seen

102
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,210
in a lot of older media.

103
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,090
And,

104
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:13,510
you know, I think that's kinda wound down by now, but in the decades after the war, I think worst surplus was like this.

105
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:18,904
Huge industry for a while as the government had to get rid of, like, un

106
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:19,865
amounts

107
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:20,825
of

108
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:22,145
equipment.

109
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:28,947
I I told you that there was kind of a crazy coincidence here that right as this one

110
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:31,760
rise were set to record this one.

111
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:35,634
A guy for who writes for the

112
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:39,254
geek website, bleeding cool named Barks C,

113
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,850
published a pretty detailed article about this story. And you don't really see a lot of mainstream

114
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,350
stories about, like,

115
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:52,443
very specific Barks comics. So I'm gonna acknowledge that I kinda wrote off his

116
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:53,855
background on this one.

117
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:56,642
Yeah. And it was a fascinating new

118
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:02,102
researched article as well. Right? It wasn't just talking about the comic itself. Right.

119
00:10:02,614 --> 00:10:04,352
It was talking about how

120
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,709
more surplus

121
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:07,625
claims were

122
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:12,376
actually the thing that were bought sometimes by the dozens and

123
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,550
by regular people for regular.

124
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,965
Right. And and today that that would, you know, I don't I don't own a b too

125
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,685
now that the government

126
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:25,945
stopped using them.

127
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:28,885
Although I did look into it and

128
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,255
there are quite a few old fighter planes,

129
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:36,345
American amp that you can get for

130
00:10:36,724 --> 00:10:38,982
less than it would cost to buy a lamborghini.

131
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:45,095
Wow. I mean, that's an opportunity. You know, you and I both lived in

132
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:49,578
the Phoenix area for a long time, and I'm sure you...

133
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:52,051
Like I did drove past the

134
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:57,130
the, like salvage yard near Tucson, right? Where they do commission

135
00:10:57,826 --> 00:11:05,654
planes and and and so forth by the thousands. Because because Uncle Sam owns a lot of this stuff. Yeah.

136
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:09,901
So, yeah. I I think I think it's fascinating. I think it's a cool

137
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:12,787
I think it's cool way to kick off a story.

138
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:19,527
I wanted to mention a little bit about the good neighbor policy. Right? This was the United States approach to foreign policy.

139
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:20,739
That

140
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,859
Roosevelt franklin roosevelt kicked off

141
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:25,619
when

142
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,059
when the nazis were

143
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:34,419
ramping up, you know, they they wanted to make sure that they stayed that Latin America stayed aligned with

144
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:35,475
the Us.

145
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:36,986
And

146
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:38,142
so

147
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:43,043
there was a lot of, like, friendly relations which kind of ended

148
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:50,007
ended in the run up to the cold war when the Us became even more pronounced

149
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:51,025
intervention.

150
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,419
But...

151
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:57,154
It's really interesting if you look into like, the history of Disney in Latin America,

152
00:11:58,073 --> 00:12:00,451
because there was like a a very famous

153
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,538
goodwill trip that walt and a bunch of the big the big waves that there disney studios made.

154
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:08,576
I think in the thirties,

155
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:15,895
that was or maybe the... Oh, it was nineteen forty two. And that was like a a government sponsored

156
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:17,931
goodwill trip

157
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:18,985
that

158
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:21,964
resulted in the release of Sal

159
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:26,404
And the three cabal. Do you know those old animated ones?

160
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,600
No. But is that where we get the

161
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:31,839
three ami.

162
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:33,600
Like, is that that arrow?

163
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,874
No. This is... Do you know the, like, Al

164
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:40,694
Is Donald with a couple of South American

165
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:44,134
characters named Jose Cat

166
00:12:44,475 --> 00:12:45,870
think from Brazil

167
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:46,828
and

168
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:54,282
there's a Mexican rooster whose name I'm spacing on. These were like their wartime films. So they were much shorter

169
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:57,971
you know, they that was what the studio did to survive basically.

170
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:05,339
And, you know, they were taking this government cash to make these and foster goodwill. And the...

171
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,220
It it worked pretty well. Right? Because those became pretty beloved Disney characters

172
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,995
in Latin America. Like a lot of Latin Americans really enjoy the

173
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:16,355
the three Cabal

174
00:13:16,975 --> 00:13:24,730
characters. Oh wow. And and so and who was the third if it was if it was Donald Duck and Jose say Ga.

175
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,110
Oh, man. You're gonna make me remember.

176
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:34,011
Hang though. Yeah. On cheap though, it's listed as Pcos stole here, but I've never

177
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:38,495
Never heard that as his full name. But yeah, it's it's pretty famous.

178
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:41,800
It's like a mix of live action and animation.

179
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:55,257
I don't think it's the best of Disney's movies around that time, but it's worth checking out you know, if you've got Disney plus. So... Oh gosh. Yeah. I'm not saying that I don't think that this was like, a dictate or anything

180
00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:06,010
as part of that whole Disney movement, you know, to foster goodwill, but it it did come at the same time. So part of me wonders if this is kind of what was going around the Disney offices.

181
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:16,072
You know, this one doesn't strike me as much of a good goodwill piece because it is it it relies so much on on stereotypes.

182
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:22,185
And and I think people would fairly point out that you know, these were widely widely held stereotypes

183
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,015
at the time and still are. That doesn't

184
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:27,540
excuse them, but it does help us

185
00:14:28,797 --> 00:14:30,454
understand them and contextualize

186
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:33,647
them. So anyway In my research,

187
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:35,603
I did a deep dive into

188
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:36,601
the Lazy

189
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:37,614
Mexican,

190
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:39,450
the sleeping Mexican

191
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:40,448
stereotype.

192
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:43,482
And a few years back

193
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:44,839
journalist

194
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:49,723
who of acts ask a Mexican fame

195
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:52,956
wrote a really good piece about it giving a lot of

196
00:14:53,534 --> 00:15:06,113
history and contacts and and how it's how the sleeping Mexican is viewed in in the. Us versus how it's viewed in Mexico at itself. And and just to interrupt, the this

197
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,099
specific image you're talking about is the classic one of

198
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:12,291
usually a Mexican man

199
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:13,624
like

200
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:15,222
swat in a set up

201
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:17,699
running back sometimes against us

202
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,776
tomorrow, because that's what you do. Sure. And his his

203
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:21,775
is

204
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,524
is pulled down to cover space and he's he's he's sleeping. He's resting.

205
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:35,954
He's taking a cs. And and so one of the things that I found interesting was that obviously, the the lazy Mexican stereotype

206
00:15:36,294 --> 00:15:38,649
pre existed this car

207
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:47,804
or this this image. And and it's a popular image north and south border. South of the border, they they see it as

208
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:54,844
a man resting rightfully after a hard day's work. But then we get more and more tourism.

209
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:57,939
To the border areas.

210
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:00,939
And these images turn into K

211
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,579
Souvenir and

212
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:03,514
that

213
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:05,511
instead of the Americans

214
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:09,182
seeing it as a a hardworking person

215
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,835
rightfully taking care arrest. Yeah.

216
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:14,389
They apply their

217
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:19,609
stereotype to it. Right. So it's it's losing... It's losing the nuance.

218
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:22,278
And it's only packaging

219
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:27,622
kind of the after version. I I didn't read the same article, but I found some of the same

220
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,024
discussion about this kind of either reclaiming or contextual

221
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,233
that because again and there are a lot of

222
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,452
People artists, especially who say, no, We wanna reclaim. We want to

223
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:49,516
redefine this as somebody who has worked extremely hard and do services his risk. But of course we're Americans

224
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,126
and American capitalism

225
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:56,124
specifically says, no rest even if you worked hard. And and no Nuance either.

226
00:16:56,722 --> 00:17:06,985
And no no. So that's gonna be a hard so. Right. And and like you mentioned, you know, the community is not like, monolithic. You you find people. It's not hard to find people

227
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:18,914
Mexican American people or Mexican people who actually love this imagery. But again, they understand the Nuance. I would say. It's the same way that many Mexican Americans and Mexicans

228
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:28,609
truly love like speed salt But again, you know, there's not a lot of room for a new nuance. So... But then sometimes we're just thrilled able to see some representation

229
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:30,330
even if it's terrible.

230
00:17:31,123 --> 00:17:31,561
Right.

231
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:39,055
There's also that. Right. When when you're thrown when your thrown scraps and it's all you've got, it it tends to look better.

232
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:40,287
So

233
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:54,421
just a little bit more background before we go into the story itself. I I usually talk about notable appearances we don't have any long running characters in this one other than the ducks themselves. The representative

234
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,186
from Vol volcano is major Pablo.

235
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,019
And

236
00:18:00,674 --> 00:18:03,843
you had pointed out, would you mind mentioning what is

237
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:09,615
problematic about his very name. Right. So Manuel means it could be morning.

238
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,775
It could mean tomorrow

239
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:16,140
there along with the lazy person, lazy Mexican stereotype.

240
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:17,576
There's this.

241
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:30,907
Right. Right. So I'm gonna put off, oh, I don't need to do it today. I'll do it Man. And you pointed that out. Can I I had always thought of that as as morning. Was that's how I was translating it. So

242
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:42,445
we've got major Pablo Money. And then we talk... I'm I'm starting talk in these episodes about what version of the characters we get because Donald is kind of an avatar.

243
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:51,625
That Barks kinda turns into... He he changes his personality a little bit depending on what he needs him to do in the story. And in this one, we've got kind of the very

244
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:52,703
sophisticated,

245
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:55,377
Donald, who's very easily tripped.

246
00:18:56,194 --> 00:19:00,025
But then later on, he's he's more like stubborn and determined.

247
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,100
Alright.

248
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,620
Without further ado, I am going to launch into the story if you're ready. Ready. So

249
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,695
Volcano Valley opens up with the Nephew asking Donald for a model plane that he regards as being overpriced. And he says,

250
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:21,874
instead of buying that, he wants to get one from the worst surplus people

251
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:26,195
for much less. So they've got a mail off for that. And

252
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:31,815
weeks later, they get notified that they can go pick up the plane from the worst surplus Depot.

253
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:33,395
And so

254
00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:38,760
they head out pondering, you know, when we have to drive out to pick up this model plane,

255
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:44,662
You know, we the reader have probably already figured out, but there's some confusion with the agent

256
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:49,550
when they go to pick it up, and he reveals that no. They have

257
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:54,917
purchased a number of b one nine seven x dash n g

258
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:56,792
plain that...

259
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:00,200
I think it must be based off the b two bomber?

260
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:06,981
No. B seventeen. The b seventeen bomb. Okay. So they they are the proud owner

261
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:07,940
of

262
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,858
a government surplus

263
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:12,709
bomber from the war. For

264
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:18,498
for only two dollars and fifty cents is how much they ordered it for. And i did. In...

265
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:20,414
I did the calculations

266
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:21,252
or

267
00:20:22,842 --> 00:20:23,342
inflation,

268
00:20:24,118 --> 00:20:32,809
the original model that they wanted in on page one was fifteen dollars, which would be the equivalent of about a hundred and eighty one dollars now. And they're

269
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:37,164
they're discounted two and fifty cent model would be about

270
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:39,660
thirty and eighteen cents.

271
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:41,611
There we go.

272
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,462
So a good a good deal at any price.

273
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:46,996
So Donald is

274
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:50,421
yeah. It hasn't really kicked in for him that he's gotten a good deal.

275
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,480
And

276
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:54,591
we see in the background, a four.

277
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:57,399
Who is easily identifiable as

278
00:20:57,936 --> 00:20:59,433
he's supposed to look Mexican.

279
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,080
Right? He's got this about bay. He's got

280
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:06,726
not quite a wide brim, but a white very wide brim hat.

281
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:07,784
And

282
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,134
he offers to buy the plane

283
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:13,024
for three dollars,

284
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:20,505
which Donald realized is hey, that's a nice profit. And before he can do that, the Nephews point out, You know, this is military.

285
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:23,536
Equipment, you can get a lot more from it

286
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:24,894
and Donald

287
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:29,382
says that he's gonna have to do better than that At this point,

288
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,818
the foreigner

289
00:21:31,316 --> 00:21:32,633
reveals that he comes from Vol

290
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:35,367
A poor country

291
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,640
and he's gonna make a grand offer of three hundred thousand volt.

292
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,394
So I wanna take some time to talk about the guy who's

293
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:48,747
who met them at the desk and and told them

294
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:49,785
no

295
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:54,155
airplane is real, good luck taking at home and also no refunds. U.

296
00:21:55,568 --> 00:22:00,302
I have some questions for you. Shoot. Is he the same species as

297
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:01,480
Pablo Bang?

298
00:22:02,093 --> 00:22:11,167
Yeah. So you are in the newbie role. This is one of those things that's just kind of like background to people who've read a lot of these ducks duck comics, but

299
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,097
these are all humans

300
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:16,167
basically. Right? They're they're animal humans.

301
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:19,597
It's very rarely remarked upon

302
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:26,599
what they happen to be. But what Barks usually does is he defaults to a dog like character

303
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:30,050
when when he's got background characters. That's

304
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:41,012
ninety percent or something. Yeah. That's the dog knows. We are supposed to read them all as basically humans. They they'll be referred to as ducks sometimes, but

305
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,007
but yes. And so

306
00:22:43,704 --> 00:22:47,156
he's very clearly, you know, high status

307
00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:58,568
you know, well groomed his hair slipped back. Mh. His ears are are pretty well formed. He's wearing a suit And then contrasting him with Pablo

308
00:22:59,765 --> 00:23:00,604
As a newbie,

309
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:04,656
I was wondering are they supposed to be the same

310
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:15,344
species, if so, you know, Pe Has sloppy less defined ears. He definitely doesn't have a slipped back hair, but he does have that circular

311
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:22,755
dog ish note. Right. Yeah. I I'd say, yes. We're supposed to see them as both essentially dog like humans.

312
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:26,666
But, yeah, I'd say that's a good pick on

313
00:23:27,045 --> 00:23:30,102
on the fact that Barks has has drawn them

314
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:33,353
everything about him kind of screams,

315
00:23:34,128 --> 00:23:38,217
Lazy Mexican. Right? Right in the kind of classic stereo.

316
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:39,293
Yeah.

317
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,247
So they they have some.

318
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:42,499
Donald,

319
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:46,615
again, he he thinks he's getting a much better offer.

320
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:51,985
We've read enough of these or seen enough of these to to know some of the tropes.

321
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:55,705
Right? And we know it's coming even if Donald doesn't. But

322
00:23:56,164 --> 00:23:59,024
he introduces himself as major Pablo Man

323
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:02,679
He says Vol Is most honor son.

324
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:06,320
He gives him the w of His.

325
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:07,773
And

326
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:09,568
he major

327
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:16,085
pablo offers to take them for a plane ride if they'll pay to fill up the gas.

328
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:20,999
Donald, you know, he feels like a rich man with this big watt. So he

329
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:24,200
gladly agrees. And then the

330
00:24:24,554 --> 00:24:28,774
gas attendance tells him he owes twelve hundred dollars.

331
00:24:29,874 --> 00:24:30,374
Donald

332
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:31,269
is

333
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:33,429
about to learn his lesson

334
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,429
because the guy tells him that Vol volcano

335
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,000
are worth and the stack of these got is conveniently worth about three dollars.

336
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:43,798
So I looked into

337
00:24:44,337 --> 00:24:45,676
the cost of

338
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:52,518
fuel at the time, I don't know if Carl Parks as far as to look up jet fuel prices.

339
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:53,555
So...

340
00:24:53,934 --> 00:24:55,272
Definitely didn't have google.

341
00:24:56,503 --> 00:25:03,388
Right. And I couldn't easily find them for as well. So I just looked up gas, which was

342
00:25:04,205 --> 00:25:05,239
about seventeen

343
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,279
cents per gallon.

344
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:08,639
And

345
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,559
the seventeen hundred gallon

346
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:20,894
tanks could give you a range of eighteen hundred fifty miles. So the gas is not quite... The gas capacity and the gas cost may or may not be plausible,

347
00:25:21,235 --> 00:25:22,975
but if they're only flying to Mexico

348
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:27,598
and back on that tank of guess, that's totally plausible. Yeah. Not too far off.

349
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:29,295
Still Al lot of

350
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:30,510
either way.

351
00:25:31,203 --> 00:25:36,426
Yeah. I was thinking about some zimbabwe and how their currency just got massively dev Al.

352
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:38,361
Right. Because I

353
00:25:38,818 --> 00:25:45,633
from overnight. And they were carrying around stacks and stocks and stacks and wheelbarrow Barks. I was I was surprised to that the

354
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:48,305
he fit thirty thousand three hundred thousand

355
00:25:48,802 --> 00:25:52,028
in In that case. Case. Right. So

356
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:55,135
Donald in a jam here and

357
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:56,848
he basically

358
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,134
is forced to bargain with the guy

359
00:26:00,552 --> 00:26:02,069
to give him his car.

360
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,206
The guy looks at it very.

361
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:10,327
And this is already donald car. You know, we're a few dozen Barks stories in.

362
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,840
We're only at our like...

363
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:20,072
We don't have too many of the long adventure stories. But this this is the characteristic shape of Mcdonald's car.

364
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:32,074
And I think this is the most detailed that he ever get with it. This is kind of beloved among fans, the the details of his car. Although it's usually shown as red and and it's blue here, So

365
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:35,020
And it it struck me too that he's very, like,

366
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:38,908
understanding about having been been taken

367
00:26:39,644 --> 00:26:40,144
by

368
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:45,181
by this guy because, you know, he's he's still going for his plane ride. He's obviously

369
00:26:45,677 --> 00:26:59,314
upset, but not so upset that he's not gonna get on the plane. And we have a little moment of jealousy as they fly over Duck. The nephews are asking. Hey, Isn't turning south and Donald too busy trying to see if someone's

370
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,007
car is at Daisy house.

371
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:03,221
I I did

372
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:05,135
notice that he

373
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:06,291
called

374
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:07,067
H

375
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:11,016
You utility fed pro. Yes.

376
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,413
I think I'm brought in Al each chilli.

377
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,025
A lot of us meaning not just

378
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:19,972
from south of the border. Right. Probably they're delicious.

379
00:27:20,627 --> 00:27:21,127
Agreed.

380
00:27:21,743 --> 00:27:26,246
Probably a lot fewer at this time. Right? I'm guessing it wasn't on too many American

381
00:27:27,502 --> 00:27:28,960
non hyphen native American

382
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:29,898
dinner entertainment.

383
00:27:30,895 --> 00:27:33,570
But... They didn't have ubiquitous otis Taco bells. Yes.

384
00:27:34,462 --> 00:27:38,431
Alright. So the plane ride is basically

385
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:41,341
an excuse to get the

386
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:43,009
Ducktales

387
00:27:43,248 --> 00:27:45,505
unaware of where they're really going because

388
00:27:46,202 --> 00:27:53,003
Pablo does loop the loop, and they don't have any safety belts back there. So all four Ducktales

389
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,301
land on their head and pass out

390
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:56,539
for

391
00:27:56,878 --> 00:27:58,995
a pretty significant period of time.

392
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:05,183
And when he looks outside the window, donald sees that they're flying through a huge mountain range

393
00:28:05,722 --> 00:28:08,473
and freaks out. And he goes up to the

394
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,503
cockpit to see what the deal is.

395
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:15,172
And he learns that pablo is literally

396
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:22,807
Al asleep at the wheel. Does it see us to time work? That's... Yeah. They we're gonna find out all about Both Kenobi and Cs.

397
00:28:24,263 --> 00:28:25,615
Because he wakes him up

398
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:32,081
or he tries to wake him up, but Pablo tells him that, you know, we I've got eleven more minutes

399
00:28:32,658 --> 00:28:33,217
because in,

400
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,208
we always S

401
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:36,644
until two.

402
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:42,146
And so Donald tries to take over, but the controls are locked. And fortunately,

403
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,272
before they crash into a huge range.

404
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:51,137
Cs to time is over and he gently climbs over the mountains.

405
00:28:52,408 --> 00:29:00,892
I will note that the art as they fly through the mountain range and, like, through the waterfall, I really liked the art for this part. Alright. So

406
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:04,385
So the nephews are in a prayer posture,

407
00:29:05,085 --> 00:29:09,599
which we don't always see. Donald and F have been praying for their lives and

408
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:11,796
they they yell at

409
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:25,184
Pablo to take them home, but he indicates that he's lost. And then they see some volcanic eruptions, which pablo celebrates because he realizes it means that they are at his home in Vol.

410
00:29:26,358 --> 00:29:28,690
They see the the picturesque little

411
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:38,757
capital tucked away in a valley. And they comment on how small it is. And and they go in for a landing before Donald can tell him, you know, that

412
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:44,714
he needs to go home and he pablo says, sorry, Sen yours, I must have forget.

413
00:29:46,168 --> 00:29:48,662
His seems of language is really interesting.

414
00:29:49,335 --> 00:29:55,235
Not just the, you know, Ee instead of i to Right to indicate that he has an accent.

415
00:29:55,655 --> 00:30:00,726
But he had a a really funny if you... I forgot to bring it at the time, but they had a really funny...

416
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:02,922
We get a lot of inconsistent

417
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:07,951
accent stuff. And and, you know, we just had a story set in India

418
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:11,925
which I wouldn't say it was like a paragon of cultural

419
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:18,617
awareness. But it it really at least wasn't like, There was there wasn't much that was like overt

420
00:30:19,115 --> 00:30:24,945
sensitive. And he didn't go for any kind of pigeon accent in that one. Oh, the in the it was

421
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,465
up at the very beginning when he was...

422
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:38,061
And he was talking to... When he was offering the them the deal for the for the claim. Mh. He said, Gee, I will give something

423
00:30:38,414 --> 00:30:43,580
I will give you... Where is that? Al Wrote his gee is not... Yeah. We was accurate

424
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:51,010
substitution. You know, the I think that one would be a little bit closer than most of what. Right? Because... Because we don't have a v

425
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:58,841
not like an english v in Spanish. So I'm wondering if you would voice that. I feel like with my regular... My relatives,

426
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:09,442
I've heard it more with a gabe. Right. Like, it it's turned into a b instead of enough? That might be a little more likely. That one's that one is not at least off

427
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:13,490
off target. Some of some of the accent is definitely.

428
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,244
Right. Like... Oh, accurate.

429
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:24,859
You're gonna characterize my people. Get the accent. Right. Yeah. And there are moments where he does some accents in these that are much better than this.

430
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:26,557
But at any rate.

431
00:31:27,414 --> 00:31:33,404
Alright. So they for Al landing and Donald starts to see some of the top

432
00:31:33,984 --> 00:31:34,724
of Vol

433
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:37,345
and clearly why it has his name.

434
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:44,619
Pablo reassure the Ducktales not to be afraid of these lethal volcanoes because they won't hurt you

435
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:47,589
But we get a nice bit of fore boat

436
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,561
that if the big one over there, old

437
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:56,330
Ever blows his top then you've Gottfredson like the dickens. And, you know.

438
00:31:57,489 --> 00:31:57,989
The

439
00:31:58,649 --> 00:31:58,729
yeah.

440
00:32:00,464 --> 00:32:01,761
And I like to focus

441
00:32:02,217 --> 00:32:08,297
on this volcano stuff because I have a lot more goodwill for this part of the story. Right? I think this is Mh.

442
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:22,755
There are basically two things that this story depends on the the two plot elements that it rides on. One of them is the inherent laziness of the people and the other is their geography, and you know, they can't affect their geography.

443
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:24,355
So... Yeah. And it's...

444
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:25,170
It's

445
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,830
it's not, you know,

446
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:32,230
common to have fields and fields full of active volcanoes in that way.

447
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,905
Usually, it's just one or maybe to you at a time that are going off.

448
00:32:38,485 --> 00:32:46,280
Sometimes you can have different events that they're gonna be a little bit more of from the same macro chamber, but they're gonna be a little bit more... They're gonna be closer together

449
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:58,147
geographically. But he does get it pretty close that, you know, there are very many volcanoes that have this specific shape. Mh. Which is, you know, like, kind of tall and pointy, and that they do

450
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,811
sp, gases and rocks and and

451
00:33:03,228 --> 00:33:08,049
they are kind of these, like molten, but still kinda solid what they call bombs

452
00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:15,045
that they just shoot through the air. They're really pretty to look at from a afar, pretty destructive if you're close.

453
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:20,269
Clearly are a volcano fan. I I... I... Al a fan of volcanoes

454
00:33:20,727 --> 00:33:25,234
I do like the little baby volcanoes everywhere which we get to...

455
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:35,595
Starting on the next page. Right. Right. I'm a big fan of those two. Yeah. After after he warns them about old photo Seo they're kind of go at the different

456
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:43,742
small volcanoes, and they get smaller and smaller until they see some cute little baby volcanoes and all the ducks get,

457
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:49,527
you know, little mini interruptions under their backside size. That's a fun gag. Yeah. And I didn't

458
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:57,132
I gloss over. I meant to mention we're talking about the background that, you know, in that leading cool article I read,

459
00:33:57,671 --> 00:33:59,345
he had suggested that

460
00:34:00,202 --> 00:34:02,816
this fictional country is based on the actual

461
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,405
valley of the volcanoes in the Am

462
00:34:07,261 --> 00:34:08,377
volcanic fields of.

463
00:34:09,509 --> 00:34:12,844
That's like the place actual Nickname, Al of the volcanoes.

464
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:14,600
I think that

465
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:18,073
I also wanted to point out a really interesting

466
00:34:18,731 --> 00:34:19,231
volcano

467
00:34:19,664 --> 00:34:31,750
contemporary to this. And I you said you you don't think you've remembered this episode of reading Rainbow where they run a story about a volcano that it appeared in the middle of a Corn.

468
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:35,270
But there was this children's story back in the eighties,

469
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:40,483
and it's based on a real a real event. For south in Mexico,

470
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,436
so not close to the border in the Us, but

471
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:44,912
it's Body

472
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,426
is what it's called. It just literally

473
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,000
cas them opened up in this guy's corn field.

474
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:51,960
And

475
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,320
nox ball volcanic gases started to

476
00:34:55,675 --> 00:35:03,287
come out of it and then, you know, ash and and rocks and it is turned into Al about volcano in the middle of a course And that

477
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:09,482
was the first time in kind of modern history when they were able with, you know, semi modern

478
00:35:10,336 --> 00:35:10,836
scientific

479
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:12,924
instruments

480
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:18,551
and and methodology and knowledge to watch the of Al volcano.

481
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:22,437
And I mentioned it if Carl Barks had been

482
00:35:23,094 --> 00:35:31,767
had it paying attention to a national geographic that they would have done some coverage of it. So this those that that really captured, I think the...

483
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:39,947
Could've have captured his imagination in the way that he translated it into this even if, you know, the Mexican volcanoes were

484
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:41,864
not specifically

485
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:47,275
where he said it. I did remember in that water fall that basically flew wonder. There was a little

486
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:50,475
a taco or a a yam mh

487
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:55,848
off in the corner. So that does kind of... Even if the stereotype is purely Mexican.

488
00:35:56,584 --> 00:36:02,866
Geographically, it does look sound right. And and I would I would contend that this setting is basically

489
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:08,346
supposed to be like a hand Latin, you know, kind of everything thrown into the hopper.

490
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:15,466
It it stands out as mostly mexican. But, yeah. It looks very pan to me. Alright.

491
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:16,305
So

492
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:18,442
the the Ducktales

493
00:36:18,402 --> 00:36:19,680
do not wanna stay there.

494
00:36:20,852 --> 00:36:26,655
They are freaked out by all these volcanic eruptions and they head to the train station to leave.

495
00:36:27,192 --> 00:36:30,059
And this is when we kinda run into the big stereotype

496
00:36:30,918 --> 00:36:32,576
that everyone in Vol Volcano

497
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:33,815
is

498
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:34,933
really

499
00:36:35,352 --> 00:36:36,092
too lazy

500
00:36:36,551 --> 00:36:37,051
to

501
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:38,821
to do anything.

502
00:36:39,317 --> 00:36:52,502
And the conductor here says that he's not gonna sell him a ticket unless he does something to make himself a national hero, herb Kenobi law. Let let me know Sarah, if you have anything to say

503
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:58,788
over the next... I might condense these next few pages a little bit because I don't know that there's

504
00:36:59,727 --> 00:37:02,219
too much to go into Ducktales

505
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,157
in these as they're just

506
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:05,356
struggling

507
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:06,275
to

508
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:08,472
basically get past

509
00:37:08,931 --> 00:37:09,751
everyone's laziness.

510
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:13,005
And do something to make themselves

511
00:37:13,305 --> 00:37:27,065
the heroes that they need to. I I did wanna point out the color fullness. Right the the the setup is are not as detailed as as a real setup it would be, but you know, there's the the guy blue

512
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:32,665
with the yellow and red setup a and then oh red setup up with a green

513
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,436
And then the the pottery is obviously

514
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:38,514
very vibrant as well.

515
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:46,384
I I did enjoy those colors slash. Yeah. I really like that panel, especially where they're where he's pointing out, you know, they could

516
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:55,850
invent soft sidewalk for the loafers first to sit on. It's... The content is not great, but the panel itself is really nice. And yes.

517
00:37:57,303 --> 00:38:10,450
And and you can see Donald getting kind of more and more and more angry. And and this is one of the times when I had to tasks, which right get over my problem with only reading the words and look at the pictures

518
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:16,022
because he's saying, like, you left a shin lot like this to come to America,

519
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:22,166
and I was like, oh is he being nice to them? Is this supposed to be like, oh, i'm i'm really

520
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,380
on their side. And then later on, he says,

521
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,260
to think that with all the

522
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,620
swell countries around here

523
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,475
you know, we end up here.

524
00:38:31,815 --> 00:38:35,875
Right. And I was like, oh, does he really think it's well. Oh, no. I need to stop.

525
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:48,149
Task switch and look at his body language. Oh yes. Lung up is... His shoulders are all the way up to his ears. It's this our cl and he's shaking. Right. It's. Not being...

526
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:52,614
Yeah. And the sarcasm is is losing there. Yeah. So

527
00:38:53,071 --> 00:39:03,150
so the ducks are gonna leave they they're just gonna head to the coast, but, you know, they figure out that they have to go through the worst of the volcano fields.

528
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:11,336
And so we get this sequence coming up where they're resigned. Right? They have to figure out a way to get

529
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:22,048
to become a national hero. And... And not until Donald takes his first nap. That's right. Yes. Which is because he chooses violence,

530
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:26,157
He says he says why Can't you lazy

531
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:36,170
look why can't your lazy loafers do something to benefit themselves, Pablo points out that resting is good for you. And and then Donald choose his violence.

532
00:39:36,824 --> 00:39:49,330
Tries to fight Pablo, but pablo pretty easily defeats him and Donald ends up being the one. Right. He takes Al an an unwilling nap. I do like the gag that we can't see Pablo

533
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:58,257
in that cloud of fighting dust. Right? Because it would it would look weird to see him actively fighting. So that's a nice. And that the the Volcano

534
00:39:58,594 --> 00:40:04,455
are still, you know, not even lifted their heads up. They're still wrapped up in there and still resting.

535
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,043
Right un phase. They're are aggressively

536
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,758
aggressively lazy.

537
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:10,074
So

538
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:13,383
we we see a couple of their attempts basically

539
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:14,872
to

540
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:16,386
impress someone

541
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,971
and and they basically end up

542
00:40:20,388 --> 00:40:26,243
worse off. Right? They tried to impress the president by... Teaching them how to milk a cow,

543
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:29,152
which is pretty insulting

544
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:35,365
to think that they don't know how to milk A cow. We get a pretty great site gag of

545
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:36,365
a

546
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:37,579
volcano

547
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,660
induced

548
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:50,303
earthquake, churning the milk into butter. So like, if you take out all the background, that's that's pretty funny. I like And and earthquakes are a regular part of

549
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:58,697
volcanic region life. And and so I I thought that one was just pure purely funny. Yeah. The

550
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:04,869
earthquake shakes the cow and the milk and whoop there's now there's butter and inside and outside of the cow.

551
00:41:05,603 --> 00:41:06,801
Yes. Inside the Al.

552
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:08,398
That sounds unpleasant.

553
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:15,898
And then I like his attempt to teach the mayor's wife to to use one of the many Al volcanoes to cook.

554
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:24,170
Yes. It his it's his next attempt to to become a national hero is to mans lane cooking.

555
00:41:24,824 --> 00:41:39,420
To the president's wife by suggesting that she used the baby volcanoes that are everywhere as a heat source. Right She knows better, she warns him that it's not safe, but Donald is in full on white savior mode and dismiss indigenous knowledge,

556
00:41:40,274 --> 00:41:48,525
to his detriment because of course, the flying pit, the frying can is flying and then the food lands on the president's hit. Yes.

557
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,342
Uncomfortable, but true.

558
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,177
And and then the president

559
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:58,223
is aroused from his slumber enough to to claire him a national menace.

560
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:08,749
I I really like that panel specifically where he's pointing at him covered in whatever was being cooked. And and that news goes around the town

561
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:13,189
that he... We've they've got a national menace, and it's mostly

562
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:18,330
because everyone is considering how much work it means for them.

563
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:19,468
Right?

564
00:42:19,965 --> 00:42:20,785
The judge

565
00:42:21,162 --> 00:42:27,260
is that he's got hold a trial. The x Huey, is morning that he's gotta work him in the salt mines.

566
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:30,211
And Donald is quickly arrested

567
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:33,242
and brought to a courtroom

568
00:42:34,154 --> 00:42:38,069
helpful labeled with the judge in the jury box and the council and so forth.

569
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:42,005
It it felt to me like his detain in Vulcan

570
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:44,776
was kind of extra judicial

571
00:42:45,313 --> 00:43:02,892
until now. Now he finally gets his day in court. Otherwise, they, you know, it's pretty much they were... They were imprison him. And now he's finally getting his day in court. Although they don't really care too much about counsel, right? Because it's perfectly fine in Vol volcano if your counsel is sleeping.

572
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:06,404
Or if you only have a single

573
00:43:07,021 --> 00:43:07,521
juror

574
00:43:07,954 --> 00:43:21,694
because all of the... All of the other volcano didn't want to be in the jury box because the chairs are too hard to sleep in. Right. And then this is pretty fascinating. Right? We've got some some pretty over imperial where Donald

575
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:24,744
is is pointing out. You know, I'm Al American.

576
00:43:25,045 --> 00:43:26,005
I've got rights.

577
00:43:26,485 --> 00:43:26,985
And

578
00:43:27,925 --> 00:43:32,479
I guess this is not really too far off reality, right around this time. But

579
00:43:33,016 --> 00:43:35,750
the judge is like, well you gotta prove it. And,

580
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:37,285
you know, the nephews tried...

581
00:43:38,123 --> 00:43:39,320
Donald for his papers.

582
00:43:39,935 --> 00:43:41,035
Yes. Yes.

583
00:43:41,415 --> 00:43:53,684
And and they try to get Pablo to vouch for him, but of course, Pablo is taking the Fiesta and then Nephew couldn't wake him. And so they're going... They're going through with this sham of a trial.

584
00:43:54,023 --> 00:44:01,566
And the only alert guy in there to Don dismay is the state's lawyer. His lawyer, his counsel is fast to sleep.

585
00:44:02,742 --> 00:44:05,556
The state's lawyer wakes up the the j

586
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:08,166
who turns out to be an ex patriot

587
00:44:08,544 --> 00:44:10,760
from from Texas. Are you

588
00:44:11,618 --> 00:44:15,111
that this is pretty great. Right? The prisoner claims to be an American.

589
00:44:15,784 --> 00:44:20,919
Says the state's council. Are you not to Al American Texas texts,

590
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:23,495
and and that's that's hilarious.

591
00:44:24,907 --> 00:44:26,085
Texas texts

592
00:44:26,503 --> 00:44:31,291
was is definitely an American at least before he was run out of Gladstone.

593
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:32,325
And

594
00:44:33,025 --> 00:44:39,925
the the lawyer asks him as a former American, do you see any wrong in finding this other American guilty

595
00:44:40,638 --> 00:44:41,496
And Text

596
00:44:41,953 --> 00:44:48,331
says that he needs to ask Donald the question. He he asks him is you all from Texas partner?

597
00:44:49,024 --> 00:44:52,880
Donald says, no. And and Text says he ain't from Texas.

598
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:56,236
So I'd say the var could be guilty of anything.

599
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,688
I read that to my husband

600
00:44:59,027 --> 00:45:00,287
who is from Texas.

601
00:45:00,945 --> 00:45:05,921
And he was like oh, great. Now we have tech Al where as well as American exceptional.

602
00:45:06,475 --> 00:45:06,975
U.

603
00:45:07,755 --> 00:45:10,415
And I'd say this is in keeping with Barks

604
00:45:10,755 --> 00:45:12,375
depictions of of T.

605
00:45:13,115 --> 00:45:13,615
And

606
00:45:14,435 --> 00:45:16,035
I I do think it's hilarious.

607
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,145
Again, it's it's a big stereotype,

608
00:45:19,643 --> 00:45:20,143
but...

609
00:45:20,681 --> 00:45:24,813
You know, i mean if I wouldn't call it the stereotype type if it's true.

610
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:40,211
They Texas is... I so much family there Zach found is from there. Is spent so much time for there. And when you're there, you are never allowed to forget that you're there. Right? Every texas this, Texas that. Like, texas exceptional

611
00:45:40,828 --> 00:45:48,926
is the... It... It's just like a micro class of America. Right? They that disregard for outsiders, the internal exceptional.

612
00:45:49,863 --> 00:45:52,398
And so, of course, the texas exceptional

613
00:45:52,736 --> 00:45:59,250
Trump's the American exceptional the. Yeah. And I can vouch for that too. Perfectly accurate. Has someone who's working

614
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,710
virtually in Texas.

615
00:46:02,722 --> 00:46:03,980
I I agree.

616
00:46:04,517 --> 00:46:16,770
But honestly, this is probably one of the like nice or more egalitarian parts of the story. Right? Because here we've got tax and Al American who who has adapted to the Vol volcano ways

617
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:27,816
and he's found his... He's found his home. Or or the volcanic guesses have poisoned and same along with everyone. Oh, I I like that thesis. There you go.

618
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,370
Maybe that's maybe that explains Al all.

619
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:35,810
Alright. So Donald is imprisoned and the Nephews are

620
00:46:36,405 --> 00:46:40,101
you know, we're very accustomed to the nephew saving the day, but

621
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,177
it is not to be because they get not unconscious.

622
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:45,195
Again,

623
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,984
by mini volcanic eruption.

624
00:46:48,361 --> 00:47:01,319
And Donald, we get a nice sight gag of Donald seeing the kids taking a Cs to two just like the guard. And of course, Donald makes everything about him and instead being concerned that there are three children

625
00:47:01,657 --> 00:47:04,789
outside of his window who lying and weird poses

626
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,120
he

627
00:47:06,617 --> 00:47:08,731
assumes that that they've that the...

628
00:47:09,129 --> 00:47:10,267
Whatever is infecting

629
00:47:10,685 --> 00:47:12,979
you know, the laziness that's infected the vulcan

630
00:47:13,476 --> 00:47:13,976
couple

631
00:47:14,314 --> 00:47:32,411
has infected his children and his grid with. Business is. Yes. To be fair Donald has seen a lot of what and nephews are capable of. So it I'll defend him a little for not being too worried. Because we've have seen them rescue him at this point by by piloting a snow by themselves.

632
00:47:33,025 --> 00:47:36,641
He is in imprisoned. Right? He facing life and imprisonment.

633
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,718
At any rate, the next morning,

634
00:47:39,577 --> 00:47:43,743
they wake up to find the jail or come to bring him to the salt mines.

635
00:47:44,301 --> 00:47:44,801
And

636
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:53,472
he locks the nephews up so they don't interfere. And, you know, at this point, it is nature that intervene.

637
00:47:54,128 --> 00:48:01,583
But not... But first, they pull the same thing that they pulled page out of the Karen here in Handbook book just like Donald did earlier.

638
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:09,659
You can't do this to us we're junior members of the Bear club Barks pebble rangers. That's true. At least they're not playing to their nationality.

639
00:48:10,316 --> 00:48:17,281
Right? This is the precursor of their famous membership in the junior witch. Barks hadn't U. Hadn't created that yet.

640
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:29,494
I did I did find it interesting that, like, weird we're part of this group. You can we are immune from whatever is happening because we are part of this group, you know, whether it's wrongful

641
00:48:30,031 --> 00:48:49,561
imprisonment or or what? But it's not that this violates, you know, international treaties is right it's that I'm a member of this group. Yeah. I mean, American exceptional was very wrong at this time. You know, I have to, like I keep... I keep thinking to myself i better be careful, like, not to not to be

642
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,634
too critical of of our country

643
00:48:53,052 --> 00:48:57,702
in this podcast. And then I think to myself, well, you know, seventy percent of my readers

644
00:48:58,094 --> 00:48:59,113
are from

645
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:02,480
Scandinavia and the low countries, which is like,

646
00:49:03,676 --> 00:49:12,941
which is where people care about disney comics. So maybe I should. Maybe I need to bash it even more. I I guess I do like that nature

647
00:49:13,321 --> 00:49:20,936
intervene here. You know, it seems very fitting. Right? Al earth way plausible. Yeah. An earthquake, Al volcano induced earthquake,

648
00:49:22,148 --> 00:49:28,912
demolish the jail, the ducks are able to get free. They dash past their the jail.

649
00:49:29,585 --> 00:49:30,085
And

650
00:49:30,464 --> 00:49:34,560
the jail take just a moment to wonder what they're gonna do and

651
00:49:34,899 --> 00:49:37,890
realize that, hey. Now they're out of a job, and this is great

652
00:49:38,431 --> 00:49:41,011
So we can celebrate with what else.

653
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:41,890
Cs.

654
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:44,050
Yes. One big.

655
00:49:45,403 --> 00:49:48,453
So we have come to the point where

656
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,446
expected old federal

657
00:49:51,779 --> 00:49:52,376
chimes in.

658
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:53,570
Federal,

659
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:56,651
the the dreaded giant volcano

660
00:49:57,191 --> 00:49:58,471
is starting to rumble.

661
00:49:58,911 --> 00:50:00,030
I didn't mention that old

662
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:04,026
Has like a very grumpy looking visa.

663
00:50:04,326 --> 00:50:04,826
Right?

664
00:50:05,445 --> 00:50:06,826
It's very personified.

665
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:10,806
This is a great panel. Right? Showing showing it rumbling.

666
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,161
I do like this one a lot.

667
00:50:13,461 --> 00:50:17,421
And so they remember what Pablo said they get ready to run like the Dickens,

668
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,941
but they're like, well, let's wake them up.

669
00:50:20,715 --> 00:50:22,173
We can be national heroes.

670
00:50:22,632 --> 00:50:23,931
We'll save their lives.

671
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,647
You know those are both good things.

672
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,254
But of course, these walking stereotypes

673
00:50:30,911 --> 00:50:40,006
are in cs mode and they are not to be woken up. And so they do find pablo, you know, they're the closest thing to a local

674
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:40,823
friend.

675
00:50:41,741 --> 00:50:43,997
They can't wake him up, but one of the nephews

676
00:50:45,505 --> 00:50:48,954
suggests to ram a handful of peppers down his gu,

677
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:57,516
and that does wake pablo up. You know, he opens his eyes wider than he has at any point in the story and comic

678
00:50:58,136 --> 00:50:59,216
cl his throat.

679
00:51:00,551 --> 00:51:02,611
Dives into a fountain and,

680
00:51:02,951 --> 00:51:07,151
you know, he he's awake though, and he realizes what's gonna happen with the old.

681
00:51:08,325 --> 00:51:08,984
And they

682
00:51:09,322 --> 00:51:09,822
they

683
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:16,918
devi Al plan. They see a bunch of baskets full of some stuff and and they're gonna drop it in the volcano.

684
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:22,305
To see if they can plug it up and and Sarah as a volcano fan,

685
00:51:23,104 --> 00:51:24,603
what do you think

686
00:51:24,942 --> 00:51:27,415
about their plan? Clearly,

687
00:51:27,912 --> 00:51:33,481
that's what everybody is missing. Right? Everybody else in the world. They're building these

688
00:51:33,859 --> 00:51:40,161
retaining walls and in Iceland to try to keep... To try to at least channel the lava or

689
00:51:40,659 --> 00:51:43,952
keep in away from certain areas. They're worried about the lava flow

690
00:51:44,344 --> 00:51:44,844
affecting

691
00:51:45,221 --> 00:51:48,908
infrastructure and roads cutting off you know, a road that is kind

692
00:51:49,642 --> 00:51:51,311
necessary to a nearby town

693
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:57,065
had they read this, so they would know. Yeah they'd have a good road roadmap. And I'm not the

694
00:51:57,404 --> 00:52:02,276
of baskets of whatever. They could've done there? And I'm not gonna go too hard

695
00:52:02,816 --> 00:52:04,596
on this because, you know, every

696
00:52:04,976 --> 00:52:05,476
every

697
00:52:06,016 --> 00:52:08,236
episode we get a little bit of cartoon logic

698
00:52:09,029 --> 00:52:11,324
Oh, yeah. And and so that's fine.

699
00:52:12,021 --> 00:52:16,192
But but it is pretty funny. So so they managed to dump those baskets

700
00:52:16,505 --> 00:52:25,126
of whatever in and seems like they've saved the day. And then they it occurs to them to fly back and check, you know, hey, what was in those baskets?

701
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,140
And they realized that it was full of popcorn,

702
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,480
and of course, we've dropped popcorn into Lava.

703
00:52:33,935 --> 00:52:38,103
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go out on a limb with my extensive volcano

704
00:52:38,441 --> 00:52:43,306
knowledge, which is not much. And say that those kernels are melting on contact.

705
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:50,701
Oh, they're vaporize. Yeah. Although this does give me an idea. We have plans to go visit the volcano and iceland

706
00:52:51,015 --> 00:52:58,490
later on in the autumn or the maybe even in the summer. You can bring some popcorn. You you do that. You do that for Pablo and the Ducktales.

707
00:52:58,490 --> 00:52:58,990
And

708
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:00,506
so we get...

709
00:53:01,004 --> 00:53:03,778
You know, this is a pretty pretty fun gag where

710
00:53:04,236 --> 00:53:06,471
Vol gets covered by snow,

711
00:53:06,964 --> 00:53:12,812
and the ducks are like, oh, no. I'm never gonna be a national hero. I'm still gonna be a National

712
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,367
menace. I'll never get out of all Kenobi

713
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,740
but Pablo cheerful says, oh, yes, you're gonna get out of Vol nov.

714
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,200
I can't dare show my face there.

715
00:53:22,895 --> 00:53:25,635
Anymore. And he's got a pretty great attitude about em

716
00:53:25,975 --> 00:53:27,275
from his beloved homeland.

717
00:53:27,575 --> 00:53:29,755
Oh, I mean, at this point, he's gonna be a refugee.

718
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:33,010
Yeah. That's true. If it if he can't...

719
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:34,690
If he's fleeing

720
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:40,018
persecution based on covering his beloved hometown in popcorn.

721
00:53:40,396 --> 00:53:41,535
Yeah. I guess he's got

722
00:53:41,912 --> 00:53:49,380
standing. Becoming in national menace. I think that's pretty good grounds for being becoming a refugee. That's a good point.

723
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,355
And then at the end, you know, they go to celebrate,

724
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:59,013
but we get a nice site where the... All the excitement of it all has been too much for Donald and

725
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:16,348
he is taking a cs to Al the at the bottom of the plane. And and his first time really sleeping sleeping. It's not being knocked out and he's got after very couple of days. He's got a very satisfied looking grim on his face. So I imagine it's a it's a good.

726
00:54:17,259 --> 00:54:18,277
Alright. So

727
00:54:18,694 --> 00:54:19,592
that is

728
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:21,466
the story content

729
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:22,383
of

730
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,877
volcano Valley.

731
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:31,778
Thank you for helping me out with that one. We're we're gonna transition now to talking about the general consensus

732
00:54:32,237 --> 00:54:33,435
and our own thoughts.

733
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:37,390
I always check Sarah, the the aggregate

734
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,150
website index,

735
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:43,724
which is great because it gets us a pretty good feel for how the fandom

736
00:54:44,983 --> 00:54:53,089
regards this story as everyone who wants to vote on it. And this one got a seven point six out of ten,

737
00:54:53,428 --> 00:54:55,326
which ranks it as

738
00:54:55,705 --> 00:54:57,923
story number two hundred and fourteen

739
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:09,577
out of roughly forty thousands seven hundred stories that have been ranked on In dutch. So that's very high. Most of the Barks stories do rank very high.

740
00:55:10,415 --> 00:55:15,716
But even relative to the other Barks stories, that one is only

741
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:20,223
outraged so far by the stories that we've done

742
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,273
for terror of the river

743
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:25,426
continues to be our highest with the seven point seven.

744
00:55:25,844 --> 00:55:26,583
And last

745
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:32,501
episode Mah raja Donald has a seven point seven Al slightly lower seven point seven.

746
00:55:33,276 --> 00:55:43,233
So this one is apparently very well liked by the fan. So I wanna acknowledge that a lot of people do like this one. In googling

747
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:48,564
for this story. I do find that there are a lot of people who have written.

748
00:55:49,002 --> 00:56:05,352
Anyone who's written about it in the last ten years or so. There's at least some of the kind of conversation that you and I have had. So I do think it's probably getting some critical reassess, but index has been around since pretty early days of the internet. So I don't know. I I haven't been

749
00:56:05,689 --> 00:56:06,189
secretive

750
00:56:06,724 --> 00:56:15,355
about this one. You know, I in researching this, I found a thread with some back and forth between the reviewer and some comment

751
00:56:16,587 --> 00:56:20,753
And so there are definitely people who are gonna go to bat for this one. But

752
00:56:21,489 --> 00:56:29,900
I think that to me, it's very obvious. That the fundamental problem with volcano Valley is that the story is absolutely

753
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:31,075
dependent.

754
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,225
On this racial stereotype.

755
00:56:33,562 --> 00:56:34,979
Right? Like that is...

756
00:56:35,436 --> 00:56:40,575
I mean, it's even kind of secondary. Even though the title is volcano Valley

757
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:43,048
I would argue that

758
00:56:43,465 --> 00:56:44,204
the laziness

759
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:50,918
of the inhabitants is the like the main plot beat to this one. And so for me,

760
00:56:51,655 --> 00:57:00,233
while I do enjoy certain gag and some of the art and parts of this that overall makes this one pretty much pretty much you're redeem.

761
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:06,416
How about you sarah? I was thinking about ways that it could be different

762
00:57:07,568 --> 00:57:08,987
and that I would

763
00:57:09,326 --> 00:57:10,465
not find it problematic.

764
00:57:10,804 --> 00:57:15,272
Right? And and the biggest thing, like these these gag aren't

765
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:18,105
not funny. Yeah. But

766
00:57:18,523 --> 00:57:19,382
because it's

767
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:20,221
very

768
00:57:20,758 --> 00:57:22,949
dependent as you said on this stereotype

769
00:57:23,286 --> 00:57:24,265
that I'm just.

770
00:57:25,161 --> 00:57:31,935
If this... If they were in, like, a suburb of cleveland. This would be pretty funny. It if it weren't... If if they were just

771
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:33,215
sleeping,

772
00:57:33,755 --> 00:57:41,070
they were just sleepy people instead of lazy people even. I think that would be funny. Because this whole, like

773
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:43,790
laziness even if it were not

774
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,470
dependent on a racist stereotype.

775
00:57:46,930 --> 00:58:07,165
Would still become a problem. So if it was just like, oh, we just want to sleep instead, it doesn't speak to our character. It's just the thing that we like to do. Then maybe it would be funny if they were right around and there was a volcano that to blow and they couldn't wipe anybody up. Can I ask you this? You you had a good thought like, what if what if it was

776
00:58:07,465 --> 00:58:13,865
articulated that it was the volcanic fumes or something? Or... Or what if, like later on Barks will do a lot of like,

777
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:17,651
alien races or or hidden underground

778
00:58:17,988 --> 00:58:21,957
races. You know, what if these were like aliens and they weren't connected

779
00:58:22,295 --> 00:58:25,142
to the specific stereo and it would have been funny then.

780
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,360
Aliens.

781
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:30,229
Sure. And you know, as long as they weren't like parallels

782
00:58:30,647 --> 00:58:33,155
to right. If they weren't thinly veil.

783
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,825
Right. Yeah. So it

784
00:58:36,441 --> 00:58:41,739
it could be funny. And I'm sure it was funny. Sure they didn't see the harm that it did.

785
00:58:42,355 --> 00:58:48,450
I'm sure that there are a lot of people who still can't see the harm that these kinds of stereotypes do right because it's not

786
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:53,718
advocating for, you know, worse things being done to these groups. Right.

787
00:58:54,175 --> 00:58:56,845
There there are very few your

788
00:58:57,224 --> 00:58:57,724
lean

789
00:58:58,063 --> 00:58:59,283
clean in the sense of

790
00:58:59,622 --> 00:59:00,721
not based on

791
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:05,930
racist or even able to stereotype of five jokes within this

792
00:59:06,388 --> 00:59:07,566
comment, and that

793
00:59:07,942 --> 00:59:20,055
that really would make me rank it quite a bit lower. Yeah. Right to rank you know, this would be... And and it would be take last place in all of the one Barks stories that I broke.

794
00:59:20,815 --> 00:59:21,135
Sure.

795
00:59:21,629 --> 00:59:22,129
Although

796
00:59:22,586 --> 00:59:23,543
unfortunately, it's Al.

797
00:59:24,779 --> 00:59:25,138
What's that?

798
00:59:25,975 --> 00:59:30,342
Unfortunately, it's also the best one you've read. So... Yeah. It will vary

799
00:59:30,655 --> 00:59:39,245
easily visa plan Al the number one that I read. Well, we'll have to bring you one. We'll have to bring you back. Because I'm pretty confident

800
00:59:39,622 --> 00:59:40,122
that

801
00:59:40,818 --> 00:59:49,388
that you'll enjoy others of these. And I don't wanna I don't wanna be too hard on it. I I do think it deserves... I I do think it deserves criticism.

802
00:59:50,764 --> 00:59:56,428
But but... Yeah, you know, I I think back to when I read this one as a kid. And I wasn't very...

803
00:59:57,524 --> 01:00:00,938
I wasn't very just minded as a kid.

804
01:00:01,476 --> 01:00:03,733
What ten year old is generally. But

805
01:00:04,231 --> 01:00:08,676
but I remember not being a big fan of this one just for story reasons.

806
01:00:09,195 --> 01:00:13,807
So I don't think that my opinion of it is being colored too much. Although,

807
01:00:14,399 --> 01:00:17,609
Again, I do like the volcano stuff in this a lot.

808
01:00:18,584 --> 01:00:20,040
I don't want

809
01:00:20,377 --> 01:00:22,192
to dwell on

810
01:00:22,705 --> 01:00:23,205
what...

811
01:00:23,663 --> 01:00:25,282
I usually have Al section

812
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:28,718
here about what is either dated or archaic.

813
01:00:29,337 --> 01:00:32,410
But we already went into some of the cool war surplus

814
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,530
stuff and then we've

815
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:39,310
definitely tread well on what's retro grade and problematic with this story.

816
01:00:40,404 --> 01:00:46,018
I do think this is a low watermark for this one. Because even though there are gonna be some other

817
01:00:47,117 --> 01:00:48,296
really cringey

818
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:50,430
stereotypes and car.

819
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:53,070
This one alone

820
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:57,090
has a plot that's dependent on it. So fingers crossed.

821
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:02,685
I don't think there's a ton of educational value in this one and that's not me being

822
01:01:03,065 --> 01:01:19,585
trying to bring it down even more. I just don't think that I didn't really learn much from this one. Sarah, did you have any panels that stood out Al like a favorite panel besides some of the ones that we had already mentioned. I said earlier, I really liked

823
01:01:20,525 --> 01:01:21,345
the colors

824
01:01:21,685 --> 01:01:22,080
that

825
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,278
show up in V.

826
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:29,365
And of course, being an arizona in, I do love

827
01:01:29,784 --> 01:01:32,477
depictions of snow. So that very last

828
01:01:33,174 --> 01:01:46,961
panel on the one page where the popcorn had. Right. Made it look like it was snowing on the palm trees. I really liked those. You know, I I liked... There was this one where they... Oh, even that pile of rocks as a volcano.

829
01:01:48,376 --> 01:01:55,296
But it was this kind of adorable. And then the... When they all getting boost by the little tiny baby volcanoes,

830
01:01:55,749 --> 01:01:57,764
That was fun. That was really cute.

831
01:01:58,101 --> 01:02:02,507
Right. I really enjoyed the court like, just the layout of the court scene

832
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:07,109
when he's brought for the high court of Vol. I thought that was a cool panel.

833
01:02:07,846 --> 01:02:12,476
I really like the splash panel that was at the very very beginning.

834
01:02:13,411 --> 01:02:14,671
That shows them

835
01:02:14,971 --> 01:02:19,550
running from volcanoes in general. That one was really cool. And

836
01:02:20,504 --> 01:02:31,809
I feel like there was at least one more. A lot... A lot of the panels as they're flying on their way to Al Kenobi. I think I already mentioned the waterfall one I did like that one. Quite bit. And then, you know, as they land in vol

837
01:02:32,607 --> 01:02:34,961
When they see it in the valley, that's a very pretty one.

838
01:02:36,013 --> 01:02:37,909
Despite what I might think about the country

839
01:02:39,403 --> 01:02:39,903
itself

840
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:47,895
and it's depictions. That looks pretty cool. And and yeah, like you said, most of these little wall volcano ones, there it's just it's a very whim cold.

841
01:02:48,352 --> 01:02:56,803
This is a very Barks and part of the store. You know, the things that he does with the Al can. So I wish it could have leaned into that and away from the stereotypes.

842
01:02:58,138 --> 01:03:02,067
Sarah, I really appreciate you coming on. Do you have any

843
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:08,520
further thoughts, anything that you didn't get to mention that you wanted to say? I did wanna point out that

844
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:12,029
i ice in Iceland. I'm obsessed with advice.

845
01:03:13,265 --> 01:03:15,401
They do have a

846
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:30,905
red that they make using geothermal heat. So they obviously don't put it on the volcano. Right they have so much groundwater that's geothermal heated. They will go near a deal with their spring, dig a hole, wrap up the

847
01:03:31,361 --> 01:03:39,510
thread that they're about to bake in foil and then bury it for a period of time. Nice. So there is cooking.

848
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:42,483
You can cook with geothermal thermo.

849
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:45,651
Donald just needed to use more, like indirect.

850
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:53,150
Exactly. He shouldn't have used the volcano as a aha he just he should have used it as an up. Excellent.

851
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:58,290
Yeah. Thank you for that. So again, hopefully, we can have you back for a good one.

852
01:03:59,385 --> 01:04:03,365
Thank you to to the listeners for joining us. Hopefully,

853
01:04:04,105 --> 01:04:06,965
hopefully, my criticism of this story isn't too alien.

854
01:04:07,919 --> 01:04:13,014
If you have other thoughts, if you'd like to defend this story, then

855
01:04:13,873 --> 01:04:15,870
feel free to reach out.

856
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:23,185
And drop us line at Barks remarks at g mail dot com. We do have a Facebook page

857
01:04:23,898 --> 01:04:27,350
And you can join us next time on Mark's remarks when

858
01:04:28,166 --> 01:04:29,783
I'm so excited

859
01:04:30,121 --> 01:04:30,515
because

860
01:04:31,412 --> 01:04:33,986
I get to talk about one of my all time favorites

861
01:04:34,323 --> 01:04:40,385
next time, which is ghost of the g. So I think this is gonna be a a wonderful turnaround.

862
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,360
So thank you, Sarah and thank you listeners.
