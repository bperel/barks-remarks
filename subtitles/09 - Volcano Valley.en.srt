3
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,658
Hello. I'm Mark Sever,

4
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:53,634
grown man who enjoys donald dot com,

5
00:00:54,233 --> 00:01:00,619
and I'm joined by another grown person who I've managed to convince to let me talk about Said comme.

6
00:01:01,236 --> 00:01:03,072
If you can introduce yourself.

7
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,487
Hi. I'm Sarah, Santiago.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,020
I am from Phoenix, but I'm currently living in

9
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,600
the land of Scrooge Inducks.

10
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,080
Scotland.

11
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:17,064
Yeah. Very exciting. Maybe we can get you back to talk about

12
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:19,793
Scottish step one. But Cool.

13
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:24,458
But today, we are here to talk about the Bark

14
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:25,296
story

15
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:29,810
volcano Valley, and I know that we both have some

16
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:32,385
strong thoughts about this one.

17
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:34,265
So

18
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:40,556
let's see. Before we get into it, Sarah, can I ask you what your background

19
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:42,749
is in comics.

20
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:45,439
I have very little background in comments.

21
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:49,384
It turns out that I have a problem with tests switching

22
00:01:49,882 --> 00:02:02,660
between visual and verbal. And so every time I try to read a comment, I would just get really confused and not know what was going on. And it wasn't until my mid thirties and I figured out that was going on

23
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:18,390
which makes me very sad because it is such an excellent medium and there are so many stories that I just have people tell me. So this is not like, unusual. I will sit people down and say please tell me this story about deadpool and this.

24
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:20,047
And then I'll just listen

25
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:31,757
because I want to... I want to consume the stories. I just can't do it in the medium provide And so I have translator. So you're like you like the story and the Barks, but maybe separately.

26
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:32,176
Yeah.

27
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:35,922
Well, we can we can look at those separately

28
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,187
in in this because this is a podcast. So, you know, it's we've got

29
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:51,015
an auditory medium to talk about something that's very visual, so that should be a good challenge. So you... It sounds like you you like some of the superhero stuff even if you don't read it directly.

30
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:53,008
I I do...

31
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:59,060
And I did... I did read... I saw I used to be a part of a podcast called educating Geek.

32
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:03,206
And it was instead of saying, oh, well, you haven't

33
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,762
seen red

34
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,652
whatever this. You're not a real geek. We would turn that on his head and say, oh, you haven't seen red heard whatever.

35
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:22,585
Let me introduce it to you. So I was introduced to the sand, which is not a good comic to be introduced to if you don't understand how to navigate

36
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:29,560
through the medium yourself, but I loved it. And I'm so excited that I get to consume the story

37
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:38,115
in, like, a movie Tv show. I can't remember what how that's being felt, but I'm really excited for that to come out. Yeah. Something look forward to.

38
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:44,030
Alright. Well, as mentioned, we are talking about Volcano Valley, and we...

39
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:57,504
At barb remarks, we start off with little little bit of background about the story. This con was published in the the cover date is May of nineteen forty seven. I guess that means it's actually April forty seven.

40
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:01,769
In the old series four color, number one hundred and forty seven,

41
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:09,334
it's been reprinted a number of times. And this one is one of the longer ones, actually, this one is thirty pages.

42
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:14,349
For a brief synopsis, this one involves Donald accidentally

43
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:18,256
buying what turns out to be a real plane,

44
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:22,220
believing it to be a worse surplus model for the net use.

45
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:27,294
And he quickly sells it to a g from the fictional country of

46
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:34,083
joins him on a plane ride and basically gets stranded in in that backwards country.

47
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:40,304
There's a lot more to it than that and we'll we'll get into that in our summary soon. But

48
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:41,939
a little bit more background

49
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:43,136
and trivia.

50
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:44,812
This one saw

51
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:46,766
it was rep

52
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:59,517
in a kind of an unconventional format I think the late sixties d's as a width... A Whitman big little book. I'm not very familiar with those, but saw that when researching it. And then

53
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:04,661
in reading about Barks something that comes up a lot is that

54
00:05:05,357 --> 00:05:05,857
he

55
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:07,706
he wrote a lot of these

56
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:11,992
far flung adventure stories in foreign lands,

57
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,164
largely based on his readings of national

58
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:15,980
geographic.

59
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:22,507
And is is widely known to not have really traveled very much until much later in his career.

60
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:26,138
But because he was based in Southern California,

61
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:26,834
you know,

62
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:28,529
from his Disney

63
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:33,290
animation days, he did make it across the border into Mexico for day trips.

64
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:34,643
So

65
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:43,509
I think that may have given him some background for this one, but honestly, I don't think the depictions of the characters and this one are they're probably not

66
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:47,629
based on those visits. They're more based on some

67
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:50,189
pretty widely held stereotypes.

68
00:05:51,024 --> 00:06:06,171
Of that time, things like speedy ones gonzales and and so forth. I did find the value range for this one. There was documented sale of a nine point four grade, which is a very good condition for seven thousand two hundred and fifty dollars.

69
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:12,698
Alright. So you know what, Sarah, I I feel the need to kinda take a moment

70
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:14,416
and acknowledge

71
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:15,255
that

72
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:26,931
I don't feel very warm and inclined towards this one and I don't think you do either. It's... You're in the newbie seat today, and it's it's a shame in a way

73
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,466
to to introduce you to Barks with this one because.

74
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:39,601
I don't have a lot of love for this one. I... I'm gonna go out of my way to find some things that I like about it, but

75
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:45,313
I am got. I actually didn't have fun with us. The the the content

76
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:59,643
it it was funny. And, of course, it's funny because this is not happening right outside, you know, our doors. So it's it's funny to laugh at how racist they were in nineteen forty Severino. I did

77
00:06:59,982 --> 00:07:00,482
though

78
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:03,135
enjoy the depictions of the volcanoes.

79
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:09,991
Because I did go to school for geology and my husband has Al volcano knowledge. And right now,

80
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:13,102
I spent most of my time watching

81
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:16,548
live streams as Al volcano and on Youtube.

82
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:21,816
So I... We had some really good discussions in our house last night about

83
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,188
salt versus

84
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:25,746
headache versus

85
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:35,834
sit and what soda means? Soda versus fantastic and and Al that kind of stuff. It turns out that there's some value in the volcano story.

86
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:38,194
I'd agree. I think

87
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:40,914
I I really like the high concept

88
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:53,485
a volcano valley itself if we're getting past some of the stereotypes. And I I I do wanna agree with you right away. I I... In ent the Internet, you know, it's not too hard

89
00:07:53,943 --> 00:08:05,024
to find people who will defend this. Story. Right? Because for for the kind of the reasons they usually do, and I I get where people are coming from, but

90
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:10,606
you know, we'll we'll go into why I I don't consider this one very redeem

91
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:15,485
in a way that that I do can it or some of the other problematic,

92
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:16,762
Bark stories

93
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,435
that this one's kinda unique, but

94
00:08:19,852 --> 00:08:26,310
I don't want to... I don't wanna go too hard on it because there is a... There there are some fun moments

95
00:08:27,564 --> 00:08:36,419
and some some good humor in this one. So talking about some of the background, you know, we can kinda split this into, like, historical versus

96
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:40,390
geographical this time versus geological, which is which is fun.

97
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,337
I mentioned this was released in

98
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:44,830
nineteen forty seven,

99
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:49,415
and I... I'm gonna think of this kind of Al the era of War ser.

100
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:52,426
Right? As as the war wound down,

101
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:58,891
this is something that there's this plot point of the the docs buying something accidentally

102
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:04,316
as war surplus that turns out to be a full on plane. And this is a trope that I've seen

103
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,170
in a lot of older media.

104
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:13,510
And, you know, I think that's kinda wound down by now, but in the decades after the war, I think war surplus was like this.

105
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:14,505
Huge

106
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:19,865
industry for a while as the government had to get rid of, like, un accountable amounts

107
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:20,825
of

108
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:22,105
equipment.

109
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:28,947
I I told you that there was kind of a crazy coincidence here that right as this one...

110
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,680
Rise were set to record this one.

111
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:35,634
A a guy for who writes for the

112
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:39,295
Geek website bleeding cool named Barks Sea.

113
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,850
Published a pretty detailed article about this story and you don't really see a lot of mainstream

114
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:46,350
stories about, like,

115
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:52,403
very specific bark comics. So I'm gonna acknowledge that I kinda wrote off his

116
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:53,855
background on this one.

117
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:56,642
Yeah. And it was a fascinating loop

118
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:01,642
researched article as well. Right? It wasn't just talking about the comic itself. Right.

119
00:10:02,614 --> 00:10:04,312
It was talking about how

120
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,709
more surplus

121
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:07,604
planes were...

122
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:12,390
Actually the thing that were bought sometimes by the dozens and

123
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:13,390
and

124
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,550
by

125
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,890
regular people for regular reasons.

126
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,885
Right. And and today that that would, you know, I don't I don't own be too.

127
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,685
Now that the government

128
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:25,825
stopped using no.

129
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:28,845
Although, I did look into it and

130
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,215
There are quite a few old fighter planes,

131
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:38,942
American Endpoint that you can get for less than it would cost to buy a lamborghini.

132
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:45,095
Wow. I mean, that's an opportunity. You know, you and I both lived in

133
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:49,539
the Phoenix area for a long time, and I'm sure you...

134
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:52,012
Like, I did drove past the

135
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:57,130
the, like, salvage yard near tucson, right? Where they do commission

136
00:10:57,706 --> 00:11:09,861
planes and and and so forth by the thousands? Because because Uncle Sam owns a lot of this stuff. Yeah. So, yeah. I I think I think it's fascinating. I think it's a cool

137
00:11:10,732 --> 00:11:12,567
I think it's cool way to kick off a story.

138
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:19,527
I wanted to mention a little bit about the good neighbor policy. Right? This was the United States approach to foreign policy.

139
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:20,699
That

140
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:23,819
Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt kicked off.

141
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:25,579
When

142
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,059
when the nazis were

143
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:33,541
ramping up. you know, they they wanted to make sure that they stayed that Latin America stayed aligned

144
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,419
with

145
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:35,475
the Us.

146
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:36,986
And

147
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:38,102
so

148
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:43,043
there was a lot of, like, friendly relations which kind of ended

149
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:49,967
ended in the run up to the cold war when the Us became even more pronounced

150
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:51,005
intervention.

151
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:52,379
But

152
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:57,114
it... It's really interesting if you look into like the history of Disney and Latin America.

153
00:11:57,993 --> 00:12:00,411
Because there was, like a a very famous

154
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,498
goodwill trip that walt and a bunch of the big... The big waves that the Disney Studios made.

155
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:08,536
I think in the thirties,

156
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:15,855
that was... Or maybe the... Oh, was nineteen forty two. And that was like a a government sponsored

157
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:17,670
goodwill trip.

158
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:18,865
That

159
00:12:19,524 --> 00:12:21,605
resulted in the release of Al

160
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:26,404
And the three Cabal. Do you know those old animated ones?

161
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,600
No. But is that where we get the

162
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:31,839
three ami.

163
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:33,600
Like, is that that error?

164
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:40,654
No. This is... Do you know the, like, Al Ami is Donald with a couple of South American

165
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,214
characters named Jose

166
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:45,675
Katy, I think from Brazil.

167
00:12:46,368 --> 00:12:54,242
And there's a mexican ru whose name I'm spacing on. These were like their war time film. So they were much shorter

168
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:57,971
you know, they it was what the studio did to survive, basically.

169
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,665
And, you know, they were taking this government cash to make these and a foster goodwill.

170
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,300
And the...

171
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,180
It worked pretty well. Right? Because those became pretty beloved Disney characters

172
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,995
in Latin America like, a lot of latin Americans really enjoy the

173
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:16,355
the three cabal

174
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:19,874
characters. Oh wow. And and so I

175
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,730
Who was the third if it was if it was Donald Duck and Jose Ga?

176
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,410
Oh, man. You're gonna make me remember

177
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:32,336
hon cheap though. Yeah. On cheap though, it's listed as Peace

178
00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:33,971
here, but I've never...

179
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:38,495
I've never heard that as his full name. But, yeah, It's it's pretty famous.

180
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:41,800
It's like a mix of live action and animation.

181
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:55,217
I don't think it's the best of Disney's movies around that time. But it's worth checking out. You know, if you've got Disney plus. So... Oh my gosh. Yeah. I'm not saying that I don't think that this was like a dictate or anything

182
00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:05,970
as part of that whole Disney movement, you know, to foster goodwill, but it it did come at the same time. So part of me wonders if this is kind of what was going around the Disney offices.

183
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:11,170
You know, this one doesn't strike me as much of a goodwill piece because

184
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:16,032
it is it it relies so much on on stereotypes.

185
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:22,185
And and I think people would fairly point out that, you know, these were widely widely held stereotypes

186
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,975
at the time and still are. That doesn't

187
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:27,265
excuse them, but it does help us.

188
00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:33,647
Understand them and contextualize utilize them. So So in my research,

189
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:35,603
I did a deep dive in

190
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:36,601
the Lazy

191
00:14:37,074 --> 00:14:37,574
Mexican,

192
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:39,450
the sleeping Mexican

193
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:40,448
stereotype.

194
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:43,402
And a few years back

195
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:45,797
journalist plus out.

196
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:49,463
Who have Al asked a Mexican fame.

197
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:52,956
Wrote a really good piece about it giving a lot of

198
00:14:53,893 --> 00:15:03,466
history and context and and and how it's how the sleeping Mexican is viewed in in the Us versus how it's viewed in Mexico

199
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,113
itself. And and just to interrupt the this

200
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,099
specific image you're talking about is the classic one of

201
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:12,211
usually a Mexican man

202
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:13,124
like,

203
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:20,736
Didn't about it running back sometimes against this tomorrow because that's what you do Sure. And is his

204
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:21,735
is

205
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:26,524
is pulled down to cover space, and he's he's he's sleeping he's resting.

206
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,740
Exactly. Taking a Si. And and so

207
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:35,954
One of the things that I found interesting was that obviously, the the lazy Mexican stereotype

208
00:15:36,294 --> 00:15:38,609
pre existed this character

209
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:47,804
or this this image. And and it's it's a popular image north and south border. South of the border, they they see it as

210
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:54,804
a man resting rightfully after a hard day's work. But then we get more and more tourism.

211
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,899
To the border areas.

212
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,939
And these images turn into gucci

213
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:02,579
souvenir and

214
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:03,514
that

215
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:05,471
instead of the Americans

216
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:09,182
seeing it as a a hardworking person

217
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,818
rightfully taking

218
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:11,755
rest. Yeah.

219
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:14,349
They apply their

220
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:19,569
stereotype to. Right. So it's it's losing... It's losing the nuance.

221
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:21,401
And it's only

222
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:22,278
packaging

223
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:27,582
kind of the after version. I I didn't read the same article, but I found some of the same

224
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,800
discussion about this kind of either reclaiming or contextual utilizing that.

225
00:16:33,518 --> 00:16:35,613
Because again... And and there are a lot of

226
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,412
people artists especially who's say... No. We wanna reclaim. We want to

227
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:49,516
redefine this as somebody who has worked extremely hard and do deserves reps. But of course where Americans

228
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:51,126
and American Capitalism

229
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:56,186
specifically says no risk even if you worked hard. And and no Nuance either.

230
00:16:56,722 --> 00:17:06,945
And no no so that's gonna be a hard sell. Right. And Mike you mentioned, you know, the community is not like monolithic. You you find people Right It's not hard to find people

231
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:18,874
Mexican American people or Mexican people who actually love this imagery. But again, they understand the New ones. I would say. Mh. It it's the same way that money Mexican Americans and mexicans

232
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:28,609
truly love, like speedy south But, again, you know, there's not a lot of room for a new one. So But sometimes we're just thrilled to see some representation

233
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:30,249
even if it's terrible

234
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:31,583
right.

235
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,304
There's also that. Right. When when you're thrown when your throwing straps,

236
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,055
and it's all you've got, it it tends to look better.

237
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:40,248
So

238
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:54,421
just a little bit more background before we go into the story itself. I I usually talk about notable appearance because we don't have any long running characters and this one other than the Ducktales themselves. The representative

239
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:55,358
from

240
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,903
Is major pablo Money

241
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:00,058
And

242
00:18:00,674 --> 00:18:03,883
you had pointed out, would you mind mentioning what is

243
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,395
problematic about his very name. Right. So

244
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:09,615
Means it could be morning.

245
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,735
It could mean tomorrow

246
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:16,140
there along with the lazy person, placing Mexican stereotype.

247
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,494
There's this pro procrastinate.

248
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:30,907
Right. Right. So I'm gonna put off... Oh, I don't need to do it today. I'll do it money on. And you pointed that out can I... I had always thought of that as as morning. Was that's how I was translating it. So

249
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:38,351
we've got major Pablo Money, and then we talk... I'm I'm starting talk in these episodes about

250
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,445
what version of the characters we get because Donald is kind of an avatar.

251
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:52,304
That Barks kinda turns into... He... He changes his personality a little bit depending on what he needs him to do in the story. And in this one we've got kind of the very sophisticated

252
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:55,297
Donald who's very easily tricked.

253
00:18:56,154 --> 00:19:00,025
But then later on, he's he's more like stubborn and determined.

254
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:00,640
Alright.

255
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,580
Without further I do, I am going to launch into the story if you're ready. I'm ready. So

256
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,795
volcano Valley opens up with the Nephews asking donald for a model plane that regards to being over overpriced when he says

257
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:21,834
instead of buying that, he wants to get one from the war surplus people

258
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:26,195
for much less. So they've got a male off for that. And

259
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:30,995
weeks later, they get notified that they can go pick up the plane from the Worst

260
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:31,855
Depot.

261
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:33,355
And so

262
00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:38,499
they head out pondering, you know, what why do we have to drive out to pick up this model plane.

263
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:44,622
You know, we the reader probably already figured out, but there's some confusion with the agent

264
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:49,510
when they go to pick it up, and he reveals that no. They have

265
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:54,838
purchased a number b one nine seven x dash n g

266
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:56,752
plane that...

267
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:00,679
I think it must be based off the b two Barks?

268
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:06,941
No. B seventeen. A b seventeen box. Okay. So they... They are the proud owner

269
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:07,940
of

270
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,858
a government surplus

271
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:18,538
Bomber from the war. For for only two dollars and fifty cents is how much they ordered it for. An item didn't... In

272
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:21,212
I did the calculations or

273
00:20:22,842 --> 00:20:23,342
inflation,

274
00:20:24,118 --> 00:20:32,809
the original model that they wanted it on page one was fifteen dollars, which would be the equivalent of about a hundred eighty one dollars now. And they're

275
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:37,124
they're discounted two dollar and fifty cent model would be about

276
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:41,571
thirty dollars and eighteen cents. Tara. There we go.

277
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,422
So a good a good deal at any price.

278
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:46,996
So Donald is

279
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:50,602
Yeah. It hasn't really kicked in for him that he's gotten a good deal.

280
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,440
And

281
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:57,399
we see in the background a foreigner owner who is easily identifiable as

282
00:20:57,936 --> 00:20:59,433
he's supposed to look Mexican.

283
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,080
Right? He's got this about bay. He's got

284
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:04,354
not quite a wide brim,

285
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:06,646
but a white very wide rim hat.

286
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:07,824
And

287
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:11,054
he offers to buy the plane

288
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,984
for three dollars

289
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:20,505
which Donald realize hey that's a nice profit. And before he can do that, the nephews point out, you know, this is military.

290
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:23,276
Equipment, you can get a lot more from it.

291
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:24,815
And Donald

292
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:29,342
says that he's gonna have to do better than that. At this point,

293
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,779
the foreigner

294
00:21:31,595 --> 00:21:32,593
that he comes from vol,

295
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:35,327
a poor country

296
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,640
and he's gonna make a grand offer of three hundred thousand volt.

297
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,354
So I wanna take some time to talk about the guy who's...

298
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,747
Who met them at the desk and and told them,

299
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:50,922
no, your airplane is real.

300
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:53,996
Good luck taking Al home and also no refunds. U.

301
00:21:55,568 --> 00:22:00,262
I have some questions for you. Shoot. Is he the same species as

302
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:01,480
Pablo ban?

303
00:22:02,093 --> 00:22:11,127
Yeah. So you are in the newbie role. This is one of those things that's just kind of like background to people who've read a lot of these steps dot com, but

304
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,057
these are all humans,

305
00:22:13,474 --> 00:22:16,088
basically. Right? They're they're animal humans.

306
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:19,557
It's very rarely Barks upon

307
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:26,559
what they happened to be. But what Barks usually does is he defaults to a dog like character.

308
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:30,050
When when he's got background characters. That's

309
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:41,012
ninety percent or something. Yeah. That's the dog knows. We are supposed to read them all as basically humans. They they'll be referred to as Ducktales sometimes. But

310
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,007
but yes. And so

311
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:47,156
he's very clearly, you know, high status

312
00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:58,669
you know, well groomed. His hair slipped back. Mh. His ears are are pretty well formed. He's wearing a suit and then contrasting him with Pablo,

313
00:22:59,765 --> 00:23:00,625
as a newbie,

314
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:04,616
I was wondering are they supposed to be the same

315
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:15,344
species if so, you know, Palo has floppy, less defined ears. He definitely doesn't have a slick back hair. But he does have that circular

316
00:23:15,923 --> 00:23:16,423
dog.

317
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:22,755
Right. Yeah. I I'd say, yes. We're supposed to see them as both essentially dog like humans.

318
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:23,829
But,

319
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:26,666
yeah. I I'd say that's a good pickup on

320
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:30,062
on the fact that Barks has has drawn them

321
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:32,972
everything about him kind of Scrooge,

322
00:23:34,128 --> 00:23:38,177
Lazy Mexican. Right? Yeah in the kind of classic stereo.

323
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:38,873
Yeah.

324
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,459
So they they have some intro introduction Donald.

325
00:23:43,198 --> 00:23:46,575
Again, he he thinks he's getting a much better offer.

326
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:51,945
We've read enough of these Barks seen enough of these to to know some of the tropes.

327
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:55,705
Right? And we know it's coming even if Donald doesn't, but

328
00:23:56,164 --> 00:23:59,024
he introduces himself as major Pablo Money,

329
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,499
He says vol Has most honor son.

330
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:06,039
He gives him the wide of

331
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:07,813
and

332
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:16,146
he major Pablo offers to take them for a plain ride if they'll pay to fill up the gas

333
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:20,960
Donald, you know, he feels like a rich man with this big what. So he

334
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:24,159
gladly agrees. And then the

335
00:24:24,554 --> 00:24:28,694
gas attendance tells him he owes twelve hundred dollars

336
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:30,334
Donald

337
00:24:30,914 --> 00:24:31,269
is

338
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:33,389
about to learn his lesson

339
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:35,649
because the guy tells him that

340
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:41,940
Are worth and the stack of these got is conveniently worth about three dollars.

341
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:43,678
So I looked into

342
00:24:44,337 --> 00:24:45,716
the cost of

343
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:52,518
fuel at the time. I don't know if Carl Barks as far as to look up jet fuel prices

344
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:55,530
So he definitely didn't have Google no.

345
00:24:56,503 --> 00:25:02,231
Right. And I couldn't easily find them for as well. So I just looked up gas

346
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:03,428
which was

347
00:25:04,165 --> 00:25:05,239
about seventeen

348
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,099
cents per gallon.

349
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:10,519
And oh these seventeen hundred gallon

350
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:20,855
tanks could give you a range of eighteen hundred fifty miles. So the gas is not quite... The gas capacity and the guest cost may or may not be plausible,

351
00:25:21,274 --> 00:25:22,934
but if they're only flying to Mexico,

352
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:27,518
and back on that tank of guess, that's totally false. Yeah. I'm not too far off.

353
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:29,255
Still Al lot of

354
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:30,470
either way.

355
00:25:31,203 --> 00:25:37,183
Yeah. I was thinking about some Zimbabwe and how their currency just got massively dev Al. Right.

356
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:41,007
Replacement overnight, and they were carrying around

357
00:25:41,385 --> 00:25:45,633
stacks and stocks and stacks and meal arrows. I was... I was surprised that they

358
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:49,794
he fit thirty thousand three hundred thousand facilities in In that.

359
00:25:50,771 --> 00:25:51,988
Right. So

360
00:25:53,002 --> 00:25:55,135
Donald in a jam here, and

361
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:56,888
he basically

362
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,015
is forced to bargain with the guy

363
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,069
to give him his car.

364
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:10,287
The guy looks at it very app amazingly, and this is already Donald car, you know, where a few dozen Barks stories in.

365
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,420
We're only at our, like,

366
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:19,771
we don't have too many of the long adventure stories. But this this is the characteristic shape of Donald car.

367
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:26,954
And I think this is the most detailed that he ever get with it. But this is kind of beloved among fans, the the details

368
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:32,034
of his car. Although it's usually shown as red and and then blue here. So

369
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:34,980
And it it instruct me too that he's very, like,

370
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:37,673
understanding about having been

371
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:38,868
been taken

372
00:26:39,524 --> 00:26:40,024
by

373
00:26:40,561 --> 00:27:01,087
by this guy because, you know, he's he's still going for his plain right. He's obviously up upset, but not so upset that he's not gonna get on the plane. And we have a little moment of jealousy as they fly over Ducktales, than Nephews are asking. Hey, Isn't he turning south and Donald is too busy trying to see if someone's car is at Daisy house.

374
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:03,181
I I did

375
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:05,055
notice that he

376
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:06,132
called

377
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:07,607
Pablo Money

378
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:08,699
mutually

379
00:27:09,118 --> 00:27:10,556
fed crook Yes.

380
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:16,025
I think I'm bought Al each Lease. A lot of us meaning not just

381
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:19,910
south and borders. Right. Probably they're delicious.

382
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:20,986
Agreed.

383
00:27:21,703 --> 00:27:26,206
Probably a lot fewer at this time. Right? I'm guessing it was on too many American.

384
00:27:27,502 --> 00:27:28,960
Non hyphen American

385
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:29,898
dinner table.

386
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:33,410
But they didn't have ubiquitous Taco bell. Yes.

387
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:38,470
Alright. So the plain ride is basically

388
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:41,301
an excuse to get the

389
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:42,929
Inducks

390
00:27:43,248 --> 00:27:45,465
unaware of where they're really going because

391
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:53,003
pablo does loop the loop and they don't have any safety belts back there. So all four Ducktales

392
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:55,221
land on their head and pass out

393
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:56,419
for

394
00:27:56,918 --> 00:27:58,915
a pretty significant period of time.

395
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:05,143
And when he looks outside the window, donald sees that they're flying through a huge mountain range

396
00:28:05,762 --> 00:28:08,433
and freaks out and he goes up to the

397
00:28:08,811 --> 00:28:11,503
cop to see what the deal is,

398
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,132
and he learns that pablo is literally

399
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:23,025
Al asleep at the wheel. Has it fiesta to time work. That's... Yeah. They we're gonna find out all about both Kenobi and Cs does.

400
00:28:24,223 --> 00:28:25,615
Because he wakes him up

401
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:32,081
or he tries to wake him up, but Pablo tells him that, you know, we... I've got eleven more minutes

402
00:28:32,658 --> 00:28:35,049
because in Louisville Pan, we always si

403
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:36,524
until two.

404
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:42,146
And so Donald tries to take over, but the controls are locked. And fortunately

405
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,192
before they crash into a huge range.

406
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:51,097
Cs to time is over, and he gently climbs over the mountains.

407
00:28:52,408 --> 00:29:00,852
I will note that the art as they fly through the mountain range and, like, through the waterfall, I really liked the art for this part Alright. So

408
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:04,385
So the nephews are in a prayer posture,

409
00:29:05,085 --> 00:29:09,559
which we don't always see. Donald and f have been praying for their lives, and

410
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:11,756
they they yell at

411
00:29:12,135 --> 00:29:19,273
pablo to take them home, but he indicates that he's lost. And then they see some volcanic eruptions,

412
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:24,604
which Pablo celebrates because he realizes it means that they are at his home in,

413
00:29:26,358 --> 00:29:30,780
they see the the picturesque little capital tucked away in a Valley.

414
00:29:31,274 --> 00:29:38,717
And they comment on how small it is. And and they go in for a landing before Donald can tell him, you know, that

415
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:44,674
he needs to go home, and he pablo says, sorry, And yours, I must have forget.

416
00:29:46,168 --> 00:29:48,662
His seems of language is really interesting.

417
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:55,195
Not just the, you know, ee instead of i to right to indicate that he has an accent.

418
00:29:55,655 --> 00:30:00,726
But he had it really funny if you... I forgot to bring it the company had a really funny.

419
00:30:01,184 --> 00:30:02,882
And we get a lot of inconsistent

420
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:07,951
accent stuff. And and, you know, we just had a story set in India

421
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:11,925
which I wouldn't say it was like a a paragon of cultural

422
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:24,945
awareness. But it it really Al least wasn't, like, There was there wasn't much that was, like, overt virtually insensitive, and he didn't go for any kind of pigeon accent in that one. Oh, the and the it was

423
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,465
up at the very beginning when he was...

424
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:37,960
And he was talking to... When he was offering the them the deal for the for the claim. Mh. He said gee. I will give something.

425
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:42,144
I will give you. Where that Al wrote is gi is not

426
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:43,580
realistically accurate

427
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:50,970
substitution. You know, the I think that one would be a little bit closer than most of what. Right? Because because we don't have a v

428
00:30:51,426 --> 00:30:58,801
not like an English v in Spanish. So I'm wondering if you would d voice that. I feel like, with my regular my relatives,

429
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,769
I've heard it more with like, deep Right. Like, it it's turned into a beef

430
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:09,322
instead of enough? That might be a little more likely. That... That one is not at least off

431
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:13,490
off target. Some of some of the accent is definitely.

432
00:31:14,826 --> 00:31:16,244
Right. Like... Accurate.

433
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:24,859
Kinda character drives my people you get the accent. Right. Yeah. And there are moments where he does some accents in these that are much better than this.

434
00:31:25,298 --> 00:31:26,216
But at any rate.

435
00:31:27,374 --> 00:31:33,404
Alright. So they bring for a landing and Donald starts to see some of the top

436
00:31:33,984 --> 00:31:34,724
of Vulcan

437
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:37,445
and clearly wyatt it has his name

438
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:44,399
pablo reassure the Ducktales not to be afraid of these little volcanoes because they won't hurt you.

439
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:47,549
But we get a nice bit of fore bow

440
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,561
that if the big one over there old

441
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:59,789
Ever blows his top then you gotta run like the dick. And, you know, I I. The going yeah. Vegan.

442
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:01,761
And I like to focus

443
00:32:02,217 --> 00:32:07,957
on this volcano stuff because I have a lot more goodwill for this part of the story. Right? I think this is Mh.

444
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:24,355
There are basically two things that this story depends on the the two platinum elements that it rides on. One of them is the inherent laziness of the people and the other is their geography. And, you know, they can't affect their geography. So Yeah. And it's...

445
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:26,830
It's it it's not, you know,

446
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:37,865
common to have fields and fields full of active volcanoes in that way. Usually, it's just one or maybe to do new at a time that are going off

447
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:46,280
Sometimes you can have different events, that they're gonna be a little bit more of from the same chamber, but they're gonna be a little bit more... They're gonna be closer together

448
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:58,067
geographically. But he does get it pretty close that, you know, there are very many volcanoes that have this specific shape. Mh Which is, you know, like, kind of tall and pointy. And that they do

449
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,851
sp gases and rocks and and

450
00:33:03,228 --> 00:33:08,009
they're are kind of these like mo, but still kinda solid what they call ph

451
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:20,089
that they just shoot through the air. They're really pretty to look at from the car. Pretty destructive if you're close to. Clearly for a volcano fan. I I... I Al a fan of volcanoes.

452
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:34,359
I do like the little baby volcano everywhere which we get to on starting on the next page. Right. Right. I'm a big fan of those too. Yeah. After he worn them about old Photo C, they're kinda

453
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:35,595
at the different

454
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:39,301
small volcano and they get smaller and smaller

455
00:33:39,678 --> 00:33:41,414
until they see some cute little baby

456
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:43,702
and all the Inducks get,

457
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:57,092
you know, little mini options under their backside size. That's a fun gag. Yeah. And I didn't buy I gloss over. I meant to mention we're talking about the background that, you know, in that leading cool article I read.

458
00:33:57,551 --> 00:34:02,776
He had suggested that the... This fictional country is based on the actual

459
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,248
Al of the volcanoes

460
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,896
in the On dog web volcanic fields of Peru.

461
00:34:09,509 --> 00:34:12,444
That's like the place actual nickname, Al of the.

462
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:14,600
I I like think that

463
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:18,073
I also wanted to point out a really interesting

464
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:19,191
volcano

465
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:35,270
contemporary temporary to this. And I... You said you you don't think you've remembered this episode of reading Rainbow where they run a story about a volcano that if appeared in the middle of a corn field. But there was this children's story back in the eighties,

466
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,190
and it's based on

467
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,483
a real a real event. For the south and Mexico,

468
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,436
so not close to the border in the Us. But

469
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:44,912
it's body

470
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:50,960
is what it's called. It just literally it has them opened up in this guy's corn field.

471
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,920
And the obnoxious

472
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,280
volcanic gases started to

473
00:34:55,635 --> 00:35:03,247
come out of it and then, you know, ash and and rocks and it is turned into Al in the middle of a corn. And that

474
00:35:03,706 --> 00:35:09,442
was the first time in kind of modern history when they were able with, you know, semi more

475
00:35:10,296 --> 00:35:10,796
scientific

476
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:18,451
instruments and and and methodology and knowledge to what the birth of a avant volcano.

477
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:22,398
And I mentioned in it Carl Barks had been...

478
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:31,828
Had it paying attention to national geographic that they would have done some coverage of it. So this those... That that really captured. I think the

479
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:39,947
could've have captured his imagination in the way that he translated it into this even if, you know, the Mexican volcanoes were

480
00:35:40,525 --> 00:35:41,025
not

481
00:35:41,364 --> 00:35:41,864
specifically

482
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:47,275
where he said it. I did remember in that water fault that they wonder there was a little

483
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:50,055
a pocket or a a yam Mh.

484
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:55,808
Off in the corner. So that does kind of... Even if the stereotype is purely Mexican

485
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:02,866
geographically, it does look right. And and I would I would contend that this setting is basically

486
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:08,306
supposed to be like a hand latin, you know, kind of everything thrown into the hopper.

487
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:15,006
It it stands out as mostly Mexican. But, yeah. It looks very pan latin to me. Alright.

488
00:36:15,765 --> 00:36:16,265
So

489
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:18,362
the the Inducks

490
00:36:18,402 --> 00:36:19,875
do not wanna stay there

491
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:26,575
They are freaked out by the all these volcanic options, and they head to the train station to leave

492
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:30,059
and this is when we kinda run into the big stereotype

493
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:32,536
that everyone involved Can

494
00:36:33,355 --> 00:36:33,855
is

495
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:34,893
really

496
00:36:35,312 --> 00:36:36,092
too lazy

497
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:36,931
to

498
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:38,821
to do anything.

499
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:47,044
And the conductor here says that he's not gonna sell him a ticket unless he does something to make himself a National Hero,

500
00:36:48,576 --> 00:36:52,463
Law. Let let me know, Sarah, if you have anything to say

501
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:58,788
over the next... I might condense these next few pages a little bit, because I don't know that there's

502
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:02,219
too much to go into Ducktales

503
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,117
in these as they're just

504
00:37:04,816 --> 00:37:05,316
struggling

505
00:37:05,655 --> 00:37:06,155
to

506
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:08,392
basically get past

507
00:37:08,931 --> 00:37:09,751
everyone's laziness.

508
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:12,965
And do something to make themselves

509
00:37:13,305 --> 00:37:17,165
the heroes that they need to. I I did wanna point out the caller.

510
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:32,545
Right the the the set is are are not as detailed as as a real setup. It would be, but, you know, there's the the guy and the blue umbrella with the yellow and red setup and and and there. Oh red setup up with a green,

511
00:37:34,498 --> 00:37:36,436
And then the the potter is obviously

512
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:38,473
thirty five prints as well.

513
00:37:39,052 --> 00:37:46,345
I I did enjoy those colors splash Yeah. I really like that panel especially where they're where he's pointing out, you know, they could

514
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:55,770
invent soft sidewalk. For the loafers first to sit on. It's the content is not great, but the panel itself is really nice. And it yes.

515
00:37:57,343 --> 00:38:10,310
And and you can see Donald getting kind of more and more and more angry. And and this is one of the times when I had to Barks switch right? Get over my problem with only reading the words and look at the pictures.

516
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:15,982
Because he's saying like, you left a shin a lot like this, to come to America,

517
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:22,126
and I was like, oh, is he being nice to them? Is this supposed to be like oh, I'm I'm really

518
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,380
on their side, and then later on, he says,

519
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,260
to think that with all this

520
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,480
swell countries around here,

521
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,435
you know, we end up here.

522
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:35,695
Right. And I was like, oh, does he really think it's well? Oh, no. I need the stuff.

523
00:38:36,335 --> 00:38:48,069
Test switch and look at his body language. Oh, yeah. Lynch up is his shoulders are all the way up to his ears. It's fist are cl and he's shaking Right. Yes. Not being...

524
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:52,574
Yeah. And the sarcasm is he's not confusing there. Yeah. So

525
00:38:53,071 --> 00:39:03,030
so the Inducks are gonna leave they they're just gonna head to the coast, but, you know, they figure out that they have to go through the worst of the volcano fields.

526
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:11,296
And so we get this sequence coming up where they're resigned. Right? They have to figure out a way to get

527
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:22,009
to become a national hero. And... Not until Donald takes his first name. That's right. Yes. Which is because he chooses violence.

528
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:26,157
He says, he says why i can't you lazy?

529
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:32,857
Look why can't your lazy loafers first do something to benefit themselves pablo points out that rest is good for you.

530
00:39:34,214 --> 00:39:36,130
And then Donald chooses his violence.

531
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:49,330
Tries to fight pablo, but Pablo pretty easily defeats him and Donald ends up being the one. Right. And he takes Al. I'm unwilling nap I do like the gag that we can't see Pablo

532
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:58,098
in that cloud of fighting dust. Right? Because it would do look weird to see him actively fighting. So that's a nice. And the the the vulcan

533
00:39:58,594 --> 00:40:04,455
are still, you know, not even lifted. Their heads up. They're still wrapped up in there and still resting.

534
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:07,004
Unpaid. They're aggressively

535
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,758
aggressively lazy.

536
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:10,034
So

537
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:13,423
we we see a couple of their attempts basically

538
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:14,713
to

539
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:16,386
impress someone

540
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,971
and and they basically end up

541
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:26,043
worse on right? They try to impress the president by showing... Teaching them how to milk a cow,

542
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:29,090
which is pretty insulting.

543
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:31,625
To think that they don't know how to mill a cow.

544
00:40:32,065 --> 00:40:34,405
We get a pretty great site

545
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:35,365
of

546
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:36,365
a

547
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:37,539
volcano

548
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:50,303
induced earthquake turning the milk into butter. So, like, if you take out all the background, that's that's pretty funny. I like And and earthquakes are a regular part of

549
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:58,697
volcanic region life. And and so I I thought that one was just pure purely funny. Yeah. The

550
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:04,869
earthquake shakes the cow and the milk and. There's... Now there's butter and right outside of the cow.

551
00:41:05,603 --> 00:41:06,801
Yes. Inside the Al.

552
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:08,438
That sounds unpleasant.

553
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:15,818
And then I liked his attempt to teach the mayor's wife to to use one of the mini volcanoes to cook.

554
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:23,434
Yes. It he his it's his next attempt to to become a national hero is to mans

555
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:24,130
cooking.

556
00:41:24,824 --> 00:41:39,420
To the president's life by suggesting that she used the baby volcano that are everywhere as a heat source. Right. She knows better she warns him that it's not safe but donald is in full on white save mode and this dismiss as indigenous knowledge.

557
00:41:40,274 --> 00:41:49,922
To his detriment because, of course, the flying pit, the frying hand go flying, and then the food lands on the president hit. Yes. Uncomfortable, but true.

558
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,137
And and then the president

559
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:58,182
is ra from his slumber enough to to clear him a national menace.

560
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:05,074
I I really like that panel specifically where he's pointing at him covered in whatever was being cooked.

561
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:08,629
And and that news goes around the town

562
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:13,149
that he... We've... They've got a national menace, and it's mostly

563
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:18,330
because everyone is considering how much work it means for them.

564
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:19,128
Right?

565
00:42:19,965 --> 00:42:20,744
The judge

566
00:42:21,162 --> 00:42:27,180
is bim that he's gotta hold a trial, the x Huey, nurse is the malone that he's got work him in the salt minds.

567
00:42:27,877 --> 00:42:30,171
And Donald is quickly arrested

568
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,561
and brought to a courtroom room

569
00:42:34,154 --> 00:42:41,966
helpful labeled with the judge and the journey box and the council and so forth. I it it's out to me like his detain in Vulcan.

570
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:44,097
Was kind of extra

571
00:42:45,273 --> 00:43:00,897
until now. Now he finally gets his day in court. Otherwise, they... you know, it's pretty much they were... They were imprison him And now he's finally getting his day in court. Although, they don't really care too much about town, Right? Because it's perfectly fine in

572
00:43:01,235 --> 00:43:02,791
if your council is sleeping.

573
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:05,167
Or if you only have

574
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:06,404
a single

575
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:07,380
juror,

576
00:43:07,954 --> 00:43:09,895
because all of the all of the other

577
00:43:10,515 --> 00:43:21,654
didn't want to be in the jury box because the chairs are too hard to sleep in. Right. And then this is pretty fascinating. Right? We've got some some pretty over imperial where donald.

578
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:24,705
His is pointing out. You know, I'm an American.

579
00:43:25,045 --> 00:43:26,105
I've got rights

580
00:43:26,445 --> 00:43:26,945
and

581
00:43:27,925 --> 00:43:32,439
I guess this is not really too far off reality right around this time. But

582
00:43:33,016 --> 00:43:35,830
the judge is like, well, you gotta approve it. And,

583
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:39,320
you know, the next tried asked Donald for his papers.

584
00:43:39,935 --> 00:43:40,615
Yes. Yes.

585
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:53,464
And and they try to get Pablo to vouch for him, but of course, Pablo has taking the si fiesta and the nephews couldn't wake him. And so they're going... They're going through with this Sham of a trial.

586
00:43:54,023 --> 00:43:59,052
And the only alert guy in there to Donald Dismay is the states lawyer. His lawyer,

587
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,526
his counsel is fast to sleep.

588
00:44:02,742 --> 00:44:05,516
The state slayer wakes up the the j

589
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:08,166
who turns out to be an ex patriot

590
00:44:08,504 --> 00:44:10,720
from from Texas. Are you

591
00:44:11,618 --> 00:44:15,071
That this is pretty great. Right? The prisoner claims to be an American.

592
00:44:15,784 --> 00:44:20,879
Says the states council. Are you not to on American Texas text?

593
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:23,495
And and that's that's hilarious.

594
00:44:24,907 --> 00:44:26,045
Texas texts

595
00:44:26,503 --> 00:44:31,525
was is definitely an American at least before he was running out of San Gladstone.

596
00:44:31,905 --> 00:44:32,405
And

597
00:44:33,025 --> 00:44:39,865
the the lawyer asks him as a former American, do you see any wrong in finding this other American guilty?

598
00:44:40,598 --> 00:44:41,457
And text

599
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:48,331
says that he needs to ask Donald the question. He has that, he Barks him is you all from Texas partner?

600
00:44:49,024 --> 00:44:52,880
Donald says no. And and Tech says he ain't from Texas.

601
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:56,236
So I'd say the var and could be guilty of anything.

602
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,688
I read that to my husband.

603
00:44:59,067 --> 00:45:00,146
Who is from Texas.

604
00:45:00,945 --> 00:45:03,084
And he was like, oh, great. Now we have

605
00:45:03,423 --> 00:45:03,503
Al

606
00:45:04,262 --> 00:45:05,921
as well as American exceptional.

607
00:45:06,475 --> 00:45:06,755
U.

608
00:45:07,755 --> 00:45:10,415
And I'd say this is in keeping with Barks

609
00:45:10,715 --> 00:45:12,335
depictions of of texas.

610
00:45:13,195 --> 00:45:13,695
And

611
00:45:14,435 --> 00:45:16,095
I I do think it's hilarious

612
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,105
Again, it's it's a big stereotype.

613
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:20,103
But...

614
00:45:20,681 --> 00:45:21,540
You know, the

615
00:45:21,878 --> 00:45:24,813
I wouldn't call the stereotype if it's true.

616
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:36,398
They Texas is... I have so much family there. Zach family is from there. Spent so much time for there. And when you're there, you are never allowed to forget that you're there. Right?

617
00:45:37,316 --> 00:45:40,211
Texas this. Texas that like, Texas exceptional,

618
00:45:40,828 --> 00:45:48,926
is that... It's just like a micro quality of America. Right? They the disregard for outsiders, the internal exceptional

619
00:45:49,863 --> 00:45:54,570
And so, of course, the Text exceptional Trump the American exceptional.

620
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:57,470
Yeah. And I vouch for that too. Perfectly accurate.

621
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:59,250
As someone who's working

622
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,730
virtually in Texas

623
00:46:02,722 --> 00:46:03,940
I I agree.

624
00:46:04,517 --> 00:46:15,730
But honestly, this is probably one of the, like, nice or more egalitarian parts of the story. Right? Because here we've got text and on American who who has adapted to the

625
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:16,670
ways.

626
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:26,722
And he's found his... He's found his home. Or or the volcanic gases have boys and stay along with everyone. Oh, I I like that thesis.

627
00:46:27,058 --> 00:46:27,776
There you go.

628
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,330
Maybe that's...

629
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:31,190
Maybe that explains Al all.

630
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:35,730
Alright. So Donald is imprisoned, and the Nephews are

631
00:46:36,405 --> 00:46:40,062
you know, we're very accustomed to the Nephew saving the day, but

632
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,097
it is not to be because they get not conscious.

633
00:46:44,796 --> 00:46:45,195
Again,

634
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,923
by many volcanic corruption.

635
00:46:48,361 --> 00:47:01,319
And Donald, we get a nice site of Donald Severino the kids taking a Cs to two just like the guard. And of course, Donald makes everything about him and instead of being concerned that there are three children

636
00:47:01,657 --> 00:47:04,789
outside of his window who are lying in weird poses.

637
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,080
He

638
00:47:06,617 --> 00:47:10,227
assumes that that they've... That the... Whatever is infecting,

639
00:47:10,685 --> 00:47:12,979
you know, the laziness that's impacting the vulcan

640
00:47:13,795 --> 00:47:23,151
and Has affected his children and it is great with they. Business. Yes. To be a fair doll has seen a lot of what the nephews are capable of. So

641
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:32,370
it... I'll defend him a little for not being too worried because we've seen them rescue him at this point by by piloting a snow claim by themselves.

642
00:47:33,025 --> 00:47:36,620
He has imprisoned. Right? He is facing life and imprisonment.

643
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,718
At any rate, the next morning,

644
00:47:39,577 --> 00:47:43,743
they wake up to find the jail or come to bring him to the salt minds.

645
00:47:44,222 --> 00:47:44,722
And

646
00:47:45,658 --> 00:47:53,392
he locks the nephews up so they don't interfere. And, you know, at this point, it is nature that Intervene.

647
00:47:54,128 --> 00:48:01,543
But not... But first, they full the same thing that they pull page out of the Karen here in Handbook just like Donald did earlier.

648
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:17,281
You can't do this to us, we're junior members of the Their club Bear rangers. That's true. At least they're not playing to their Al. Right? This is the precursor that their famous membership and the junior would. Barks hadn't U. Hadn't created that yet.

649
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:29,454
I did I did find it interesting that, like, we're we are part of this group. You can we immune from whatever is happening because we are part of this group, you know, whether it's wrongful

650
00:48:30,031 --> 00:48:42,404
imprisonment or or what? But it's not that this violates, you know, international treaties is is I'm a member of this group. Yeah. I mean, American Exceptional was very wrong at this time.

651
00:48:42,742 --> 00:48:50,879
You know, I have to, like I keep... I keep thinking to myself i better be careful like, not to not to be too critical

652
00:48:51,217 --> 00:48:52,594
of of our country

653
00:48:53,012 --> 00:48:57,702
in this podcast. And then I think to myself, well, you know, seventy percent of my readers

654
00:48:58,055 --> 00:48:59,033
are from

655
00:48:59,410 --> 00:48:59,910
Scan

656
00:49:00,526 --> 00:49:02,440
and the low countries, which is like,

657
00:49:03,676 --> 00:49:12,941
which is where people care about Disney comics. So Maybe I should. Maybe I need to fashion it even more. I I guess I do like that nature

658
00:49:13,281 --> 00:49:20,396
intervene here. You know, it seems very fitting. Right? Al earth way possible. Yeah. Al earth earthquake of Volcano and

659
00:49:20,736 --> 00:49:20,936
earthquake.

660
00:49:22,108 --> 00:49:25,380
Demolish is the jail, the Ducktales are able to get free.

661
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:28,833
They dash past their... The jail

662
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:37,735
and the jail take just a moment to wonder what they're gonna do and realize that, hey. Now they're out of a job, and this is great.

663
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,790
So we can celebrate with what else?

664
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:44,491
C does. Yes. One big si.

665
00:49:45,364 --> 00:49:48,453
So we are... Have come to the point where

666
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,446
expected old federal

667
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:52,376
chimes in.

668
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:53,570
Fe,

669
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:56,610
the the dreaded giant volcano

670
00:49:57,151 --> 00:49:58,510
is starting to Rumble.

671
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,610
I didn't mention that old Fe

672
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:04,745
has like a a very grumpy looking visit. Right?

673
00:50:05,445 --> 00:50:06,146
It's very

674
00:50:06,725 --> 00:50:10,806
personified. This is a great panel. Right? It's showing and showing it rumbling.

675
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,120
I do like this one a lot.

676
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:17,380
And so they remember what Pablo said that they get ready to run like, the dickens.

677
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,901
But they're like, well, let's wake come up.

678
00:50:20,715 --> 00:50:22,134
We can be national heroes.

679
00:50:22,632 --> 00:50:23,851
We'll save their lives.

680
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,427
You know, those are both good things.

681
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,214
But, of course, these walking stereotypes

682
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:31,331
are

683
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:40,006
in Si mode and they are not to be woken up. And so they do find pablo, you know, they're the closest thing to a local

684
00:50:40,424 --> 00:50:40,783
friend.

685
00:50:41,741 --> 00:50:43,957
They can't wake him up, but one of the nephews

686
00:50:45,466 --> 00:50:48,675
suggests to ram a handful of peppers down his.

687
00:50:49,331 --> 00:50:57,476
And that does wake pablo up. You know, he opens his eyes wider than he has at any point in the story and economically

688
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,176
punches is throat.

689
00:51:00,511 --> 00:51:01,851
Dives into a fountain

690
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:02,651
and,

691
00:51:02,951 --> 00:51:07,731
you know, he... He's awake though, and he realizes what's gonna happen with the old Fe.

692
00:51:08,325 --> 00:51:08,984
And they

693
00:51:09,322 --> 00:51:16,878
they devi a plan. They see a bunch of baskets full of some stuff and and they're gonna drop it in the volcano.

694
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:22,345
To see if they can plug it up and and Sarah as a volcano fan,

695
00:51:23,104 --> 00:51:27,335
what do you think about their plan? Clearly,

696
00:51:27,873 --> 00:51:33,481
that's what everybody is missing. Right? Everybody else in the world. They're building these

697
00:51:33,859 --> 00:51:34,878
retaining walls

698
00:51:35,256 --> 00:51:36,250
in in

699
00:51:36,628 --> 00:51:40,161
to try to keep... To try to Al least channel the lava or

700
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:43,691
keep it away from certain areas they're worried about for the lava flow.

701
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:44,804
Affecting

702
00:51:45,181 --> 00:51:48,908
infrastructure and roads cutting off, you know, a road that is kinda

703
00:51:49,324 --> 00:51:51,116
necessary to and nearby town,

704
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:56,785
had they read this, so they would know. Yeah. They have a good road map. And I'm not

705
00:51:57,404 --> 00:51:59,182
of baskets of whatever.

706
00:51:59,562 --> 00:52:02,276
They kinda done that. And I'm not gonna go too hard

707
00:52:02,816 --> 00:52:04,596
on this because, you know, every

708
00:52:04,976 --> 00:52:05,476
every

709
00:52:05,976 --> 00:52:08,096
episode, we get a little bit of cartoon logic,

710
00:52:09,029 --> 00:52:11,284
Oh, yeah. And and so that's fine.

711
00:52:12,021 --> 00:52:16,152
But is pretty funny. So so they managed to dump those baskets

712
00:52:16,505 --> 00:52:25,126
of whatever in and it seems like they've saved the day. And then they... It occurs to them to fly back and check, you know, hey, what was in those baskets?

713
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,100
And they realized that it was full of popcorn

714
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,480
and of course, we dropped popcorn into Lava,

715
00:52:33,935 --> 00:52:38,063
I'm gonna I'm gonna out on a limb with my extensive volcano

716
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:43,306
knowledge, which is not much. And say that those kernels are melting on contact.

717
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:50,201
Oh, they're pricing. Yeah. Although this does give me an idea. We have clients to go visit the on Al

718
00:52:51,015 --> 00:52:57,836
later on in the autumn or the maybe even in the summer. You can bring some popcorn. You you do that. You do that for pablo and the docks.

719
00:52:58,490 --> 00:52:58,990
And

720
00:52:59,447 --> 00:53:00,466
so we get...

721
00:53:01,004 --> 00:53:03,778
You know, this is a pretty pretty fun gag where

722
00:53:04,236 --> 00:53:06,391
Vulcan gets covered by snow,

723
00:53:07,005 --> 00:53:12,812
and the Ducktales are like, oh, no. I'm never gonna be a national hero. I'm still gonna be Al national

724
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,186
Man. I'll never get out of all Ken.

725
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:19,040
Ben pablo cheerful says, oh, yes, you're gonna get out of Al.

726
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,160
I can't dare show my face there.

727
00:53:22,855 --> 00:53:25,395
Anymore, and he's got a pretty great attitude about

728
00:53:25,935 --> 00:53:32,970
from his beloved homeland. Oh, I mean, at this point, he's gonna be a refugee to Yeah. That's true. If if his he can't...

729
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:34,650
If he's is fleeing

730
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:39,979
persecution based on covering his beloved hometown in popcorn.

731
00:53:40,396 --> 00:53:49,120
Yeah. I guess he's got that understanding. Becoming a national menace. I think that's pretty good grounds for being becoming a refugee. That's a good point.

732
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,355
And then at the end, you know, they go to celebrate,

733
00:53:52,732 --> 00:53:59,013
but we get a nice site where the... All the excitement of it all has been too much donald, and

734
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:16,667
he is taking a Si to at the at the bottom of the plane. And this first time really sleeping sleeping. Aside from being knocked out. And he's gotta a married couple days. He's got a very satisfied looking grim on his face. So I imagine it's a it's a good si.

735
00:54:17,259 --> 00:54:18,197
Alright. So

736
00:54:18,574 --> 00:54:19,632
that is

737
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:21,387
the story content

738
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:22,383
of

739
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,837
Volcano Valley.

740
00:54:24,754 --> 00:54:31,738
Thank you for helping me out with that one. We're we're gonna transition now to talking about the general consensus

741
00:54:32,237 --> 00:54:33,395
and our own thoughts.

742
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:37,390
I always check sarah the the aggregate

743
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,110
website index

744
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:43,645
which is great because it gets us a pretty good feel for how the and

745
00:54:44,942 --> 00:54:52,969
regards this story as everyone who wants to vote on it. And this one got a seven point six out of ten,

746
00:54:53,428 --> 00:54:55,326
which ranks it as

747
00:54:55,705 --> 00:54:57,884
storing number two hundred and fourteen

748
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,840
out of roughly forty thousand

749
00:55:01,154 --> 00:55:09,838
seven hundred stories that have been ranked on Inducks. So that's very high. Most of the Barks stories do rank very high

750
00:55:10,415 --> 00:55:15,636
but even relative to the other Barks stories, that one is only

751
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:20,183
out ranked so far by the stories that we've done

752
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,273
for tear of the river

753
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:25,285
continues to be our highest with a seven point seven.

754
00:55:25,844 --> 00:55:26,543
And last

755
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:32,360
episode Mah raja Donald has the seven point seven a slightly lower seven point seven.

756
00:55:33,236 --> 00:55:43,193
So this one is apparently very well liked by the fan. So I wanna acknowledge that a lot of people do like this one. In googling

757
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:48,564
for this story. I do find that there are a lot of people who have written.

758
00:55:49,002 --> 00:56:05,273
Anyone who's written about it in the last ten years or so. There's at least some of the kind of conversation that you and I have had. So I do think it's probably getting some critical reassess, but index has been around since pretty early days of the Internet. So I don't know. I I haven't been

759
00:56:05,649 --> 00:56:06,149
secretive

760
00:56:06,685 --> 00:56:15,035
about this one. You know, I... In researching this, I found a thread with some back and forth between the reviewer and some.

761
00:56:16,587 --> 00:56:20,713
And so there are definitely people who are gonna go to bat for this one. But

762
00:56:21,449 --> 00:56:29,860
I think that to me, it's very obvious. That the fundamental problem with Volcano Valley is that the story is absolutely

763
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:31,096
dependent

764
00:56:31,648 --> 00:56:34,979
on this racial stereotype. Right? Like, that is...

765
00:56:35,436 --> 00:56:40,420
I mean, it's even kind of secondary even though the title is Volcano Valley,

766
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:44,204
I would argue that the the laziness

767
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,038
of the inhabitants

768
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:50,878
is like the main plot to this one. And so for me,

769
00:56:51,615 --> 00:57:00,192
while I do enjoy certain gigs and some of the art and parts of this, that overall makes this one pretty much pretty much you're redeem.

770
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:06,416
How about you, Sarah? I was thinking about ways that it could be different

771
00:57:07,608 --> 00:57:15,232
and that I would not find it problematic. Right? And and the biggest thing... Like these These gigs aren't

772
00:57:15,889 --> 00:57:18,105
not funny. Yeah. But

773
00:57:18,443 --> 00:57:19,382
because it's

774
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:20,221
very

775
00:57:20,718 --> 00:57:22,909
dependent as you said on this stereotype

776
00:57:23,246 --> 00:57:24,703
that I'm just woah.

777
00:57:25,161 --> 00:57:31,935
If this... If they were in, like a suburb cleveland one This would be pretty funny. It it... Is it where... If if they were just

778
00:57:32,675 --> 00:57:33,175
sleeping,

779
00:57:33,755 --> 00:57:40,610
they're just sleepy people instead of lazy people even. I think that would be funny because this whole, like,

780
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:43,750
laziness even if it were not

781
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,470
dependent on a racist stereotype.

782
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,941
Would still become a problem. So if it was just like, oh,

783
00:57:50,699 --> 00:58:07,125
we just want to sleep instead. It doesn't speak to our character. It's just the thing that we like to do then maybe it would be funny. They were right around and there was a volcano about to blow and they couldn't like anybody up. Can I ask you this? You you had a good thought, like, what if what if it was

784
00:58:07,785 --> 00:58:13,825
that it was the volcanic fumes or something or... Or what if, like, later on, Barks will do a lot of, like,

785
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:17,571
alien races or or hidden underground

786
00:58:17,988 --> 00:58:20,322
race. You know, what if these were like aliens

787
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,957
and they weren't connected

788
00:58:22,295 --> 00:58:25,182
to the specific stereotype and it would have been funny then?

789
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:26,679
Anything is.

790
00:58:27,017 --> 00:58:30,189
Sure. And you know, as long as they weren't, like parallel

791
00:58:30,647 --> 00:58:33,155
to right if they weren't thinly veil.

792
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,825
Right. Yeah. So it

793
00:58:36,441 --> 00:58:41,739
it could be funny. And i'm sure it was funny sure they didn't see the harm that it did.

794
00:58:42,355 --> 00:58:48,450
I'm sure that there are a lot of people who still can't see the harm that these Inducks stereotypes types do. Right? Because it's not

795
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:53,258
advocating for, you know, worse things being done to these groups. Right.

796
00:58:54,175 --> 00:58:59,283
They're there are very few your leaf lean clean in the sense of

797
00:58:59,622 --> 00:59:00,721
not based on

798
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,078
racist or even able to stereotype

799
00:59:04,577 --> 00:59:05,930
jokes within this

800
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,526
comment and that

801
00:59:07,942 --> 00:59:20,095
that really would make me rank it quite a bit lower. For try to rank you know, this would be... In... It would be take last place in all of the one Barks stories that I've read.

802
00:59:20,815 --> 00:59:21,095
Sure.

803
00:59:21,629 --> 00:59:22,129
Although

804
00:59:22,546 --> 00:59:23,583
unfortunately, it's also...

805
00:59:24,739 --> 00:59:25,098
What's that?

806
00:59:25,975 --> 00:59:39,205
Unfortunately, it's also the best one you've read. So... Yeah. It will vary easily be disappointed Al the number one that I read. Well, we'll have to bring you one. We'll have to bring you back. Because I'm pretty confident

807
00:59:39,582 --> 00:59:40,082
that

808
00:59:40,818 --> 00:59:49,388
that you'll enjoy. Others of these. And I don't wanna... I don't wanna be too hard on it. I do you think it deserves... I I do think it deserves criticism.

809
00:59:50,764 --> 00:59:56,388
But but... Yeah. You know, I I think back to when I read this one is a kid. And I wasn't very...

810
00:59:57,484 --> 01:00:00,718
I wasn't very just minded as a kid,

811
01:00:01,476 --> 01:00:03,693
what ten year old is, generally. But

812
01:00:04,231 --> 01:00:08,557
but I remember not being a big fan of this one just for story reasons.

813
01:00:09,155 --> 01:00:13,745
So I don't think that my opinion of it is being colored too much. Although,

814
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:17,468
Again, I do like the volcano stuff in this a lot.

815
01:00:18,504 --> 01:00:22,192
I don't want to dwell on

816
01:00:22,705 --> 01:00:23,184
what...

817
01:00:23,663 --> 01:00:25,242
I usually have all section

818
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:28,578
here about what is either dated or archaic.

819
01:00:29,337 --> 01:00:32,090
But we already went into some of the cool war

820
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:34,530
stuff, and then we've

821
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:39,310
definitely tread well on what's retro grade and problematic with this story.

822
01:00:40,404 --> 01:00:45,979
I do think this is a low water Barks for this one because even though there are gonna be some other

823
01:00:47,037 --> 01:00:48,256
really cri

824
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:50,390
stereotypes and characters.

825
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:52,990
This one alone

826
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:57,090
has a plot that's dependent on it. So fingers crossed.

827
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:02,605
I don't think there's a ton of educational value in this one and that's not me being

828
01:01:02,985 --> 01:01:16,965
trying to bring it down even more. I just don't think that I didn't really learn much from this one. Sarah, did you have any panels that stood out as, like a favorite panel besides some of the ones that we had already mentioned.

829
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:19,545
I said earlier, I really liked

830
01:01:20,485 --> 01:01:21,265
the colors

831
01:01:21,685 --> 01:01:22,080
that

832
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,698
show up in in.

833
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:27,594
And of course, being in Arizona,

834
01:01:28,012 --> 01:01:29,365
I do love

835
01:01:29,784 --> 01:01:32,398
depictions of snow. So that very last

836
01:01:33,134 --> 01:01:47,596
panel on the one page where the popcorn had Right. Made it look like it was snowing on the phone, trees I really liked those. You know, I I'd like to... There was this one where they... Oh, even that pile of rocks as a volcano. This

837
01:01:48,376 --> 01:01:55,255
But was this kind of adorable and then the... When they were all getting boost by the little tiny baby volcanoes?

838
01:01:55,749 --> 01:02:02,467
That was fun. That was really cute. Right. I really enjoyed the court like, just the layout of the court scene

839
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:06,888
when he's brought for the high cord of Vol. I thought that was a cool panel.

840
01:02:07,846 --> 01:02:12,476
I really like the splash panel that was at the very very beginning.

841
01:02:13,411 --> 01:02:14,630
That shows them

842
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:19,550
running from volcanoes in general. That one was really cool. And

843
01:02:20,504 --> 01:02:34,881
I feel like there was at least one more. A lot... A lot of the panels as they're flying on their weight of Al. I think I already mentioned the waterfall one. I did like that one quite a bit. And then, you know, as they land involve Ken when they see it in the valley, that's a very pretty one.

844
01:02:36,013 --> 01:02:37,869
Despite what I might think about the country

845
01:02:39,364 --> 01:02:39,864
itself.

846
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:47,895
And it's depictions. That looks pretty cool. And and... Yeah, like you said, most of these little volcano ones, there... It's just it's a very whim cold.

847
01:02:48,352 --> 01:02:56,803
This is a very Barks part of the store, you know, the things that he does with the ball tandem. So I wish it could have leaned into that and away from the stereo.

848
01:02:58,098 --> 01:03:02,067
Sarah, I really appreciate you coming on. Do you have any

849
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:08,520
further thoughts, anything that you didn't get to mention that you wanted to say? I did wanna point out that

850
01:03:09,515 --> 01:03:11,850
ice in eyesight. I'm obsessed.

851
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:15,401
Like they do have a

852
01:03:15,979 --> 01:03:18,768
red that they make using geothermal.

853
01:03:19,425 --> 01:03:30,905
So they obviously don't put it on the volcano. But they have so much groundwater that's geothermal normally heated they will go near to you with their most spraying, dig a hole, wrap up the

854
01:03:31,282 --> 01:03:39,450
red that they're about to Barks in foil and then bury it for a period of time. Nice. So there is cooking.

855
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:42,124
You can cook with geothermal.

856
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:45,672
Donald just needed to use more like indirect

857
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:53,130
Exactly. He shouldn't have used the volcano as a hot. He just... He should have used it as. Excellent.

858
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:58,210
Yeah. Thank you for that. So again, hopefully, we can have you back for a a good one.

859
01:03:59,345 --> 01:04:03,325
Thank you to to the listeners for joining us. Hopefully,

860
01:04:04,065 --> 01:04:07,340
hopefully, my criticism is this story isn't too alien eliminating

861
01:04:07,919 --> 01:04:13,014
If you have other thoughts, if you'd like to defend this story, then

862
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:15,931
feel free to reach out

01:04:23,898 --> 01:04:27,350
And you can join us next time on mark's remarks when

865
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:30,515
I'm I'm so excited because

866
01:04:31,412 --> 01:04:40,486
I get to talk about one of my all time favorites. Next time, which is ghost of the g. So I think this is gonna be a a a wonderful turnaround

867
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,360
So thank you, Sarah, and thank you listeners.
