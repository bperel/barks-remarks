6
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:04,635
Khan,

7
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:07,715
you are a fan artist

8
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,930
from Norway. Do you wanna introduce yourself and maybe just mention a little bit about your

9
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:22,125
history with the economics? Yeah. Hi, Mark. It's great to be back again and on my own man who also grew up with Barks amazing chrome.

10
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,160
And a huge fan especially,

11
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,880
especially of local screw venture adventures. Yeah. My history with the fan art and

12
00:01:30,194 --> 00:01:32,965
so is that I back in two thousand and twelve

13
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:34,281
participated in

14
00:01:34,657 --> 00:01:37,987
make your own car for the rich down Magazine

15
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,360
and I got a little five page

16
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,360
story and published. And

17
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,320
I've written some pre face

18
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,654
texts for a book and been on this

19
00:01:47,993 --> 00:01:52,608
in Way to talk about drawing and I'm think I made

20
00:01:53,027 --> 00:02:03,104
six stories that has been published. So far? Yeah. Excellent. So so more than just a fan artist, you've you've gotten to be published. Very... That must be really exciting.

21
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:08,818
Very thrilling. I I really enjoy your art. You put out a new... Just just yesterday. You had a really cool

22
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:11,950
new image of screws that I really like

23
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:13,984
and and you mentioned

24
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:18,130
Disney channel. That's an appropriate thing to talk about. Right? Because

25
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:22,610
duct, I I assume that's where duck paired in in Norway.

26
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:24,364
Yeah. And also

27
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,637
Yeah. It used to error on

28
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,569
our main channel.

29
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:39,543
Mostly, I think before we go even there's general. Right. Yeah. Kinda the same over here in the Us where it would aaron and Inducks indication and then eventually on Disney channel.

30
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:41,697
But this is a pretty famous

31
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:46,185
stuck story as far as as, like, Ducktales itself goes.

32
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:54,745
I'm definitely planning to mention the the episode. So so let me ask you before we even get into the story, the the

33
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:59,265
distinct thing about this story is the presence of the

34
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:02,119
creature, the the obama snowman,

35
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:08,950
aka k, the Y. It's it's got a lot of lot of names from around the world, different culture

36
00:03:09,785 --> 00:03:14,765
you know, big foot is kind of on another version of it. But I'm wondering

37
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:17,525
what what is your, like, first pop culture

38
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:33,657
experience with the obama snowman or yet or whatever you wanna call. That's because what feeling because I didn't... I've given you some thoughts. And I think my first experience with the the, the abdominal snowman, I think that was actually the first time I also

39
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:35,568
and encountered Uncle Scrooge

40
00:03:36,287 --> 00:03:37,805
in the duck election.

41
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:38,404
Okay.

42
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:55,551
So so that actually was your first encounter with it. That's pretty cool think so. Yeah. Very neat. I think this probably would have been my second third. This this is like a a big pop culture trope. Right? A lot a lot of shows will maybe have an episode

43
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:57,027
a a nice winter

44
00:03:57,364 --> 00:04:02,984
episodes sat in in the Hi himalayas, which is usually where the snowman takes place.

45
00:04:03,324 --> 00:04:25,170
For me, there's a very famous stop motion cartoon in the Us by by the production company rank and Barks. The root off the red nose is Reindeer deer, Cartoon. Is that is that something that is known in Scan at all? Yeah. We have a lots of other with with the rudolph the the red nose rain there. I can think of men

46
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:26,007
cartoons

47
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:31,008
with I can't remember anyone with the bum snowman or.

48
00:04:31,947 --> 00:04:47,240
So so in the states, this is probably like one of the three or four most famous Christmas cartoons. There's like this one very specific version of root off the Red nose rain reindeer. Like I said, that's stop motion. And it has a really

49
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,880
comic version of the

50
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,333
snowman that they call the bundle. It's it's a fun

51
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,836
characterization, and it's kind of... It kind of is gonna play in with the the comic

52
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:07,520
and very goofy depiction in in this story. But... Yeah. Yeah. This is like this is a story that the story of the

53
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:15,990
snowman the myth, I guess, is always kinda fascinated me as a kid, right? The idea of this, like, creature, this Al Barks feature

54
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:18,357
that hides up in the mountains.

55
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:36,860
Did you... Did you happen to do any research like I did into kind of the origins of the myth? Yeah. I I did some research and go ahead and get ready and here... Here's what I'll do. Why don't I introduce the comic, right? Because we're gonna talk about when this was published, which was kind of like a kind of a hot time

56
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,499
for for the

57
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:47,708
snow. But our our story today, again, the full title is the lost crown of Youngest khan. Has got a nice

58
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:53,669
exclamation point at the end of it just to make it extra exciting. This one came out

59
00:05:54,129 --> 00:06:12,477
and it had a cover date of May of nineteen fifty six. So we're we're into the second half of the fifties at this point, you know, we're kind of getting farther away from World war two, which informed some of Barks earlier stories and we're kinda going into, like, an area of kind of cold war paranoia,

60
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:20,921
which is gonna be kind of the backdrop for some of his stories going forward. This one was published in the uncles screws number fourteen,

61
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:27,302
and it it hasn't had as many reprint at least in the United States as many

62
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:37,820
comparable uncle Scrooge events. It's it's only eight of them including the original one. And a it's a fairly short screw as well. It's only nineteen pages.

63
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:41,527
So, Nicole, we mentioned that this takes place in nineteen

64
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:43,442
fifty six.

65
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,970
This was published to nineteen fifty six what did you learn about the

66
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,729
Yeti Myth? Around that time? Yeah. As you said, Mark, the story is made then it's actually made in nineteen fifty five

67
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:11,939
right. Published in fifty six. And that's the eight of the safe conservative American family life and with the rest of the cold war and leaning in the back ground. Yeah. But the the people know to get some excitement as long as this was in control forms and only for a short time. So news

68
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:26,605
broadcast on television really got into this the time with reports of the for the bum snowman. Mh mh And I found out that the the british explorer eric shipment from many huge footprints in on the mainland

69
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:33,573
glacier of amongst everest nineteen fifty one, and the new support true themselves and this and

70
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,849
rev old legend of the Y. The huge

71
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:39,780
more than two meters tall, Al ply feature of

72
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:44,485
Mountains, they're encrypted similar to the American Source.

73
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:49,285
And one of the local names for the essay actually can be translated to folds,

74
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,905
full smelling slow man.

75
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:56,540
Neat. So yeah I didn't I didn't catch all of that. I did see of an expedition

76
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:08,623
a couple years after that, I think Or around that time where they reported finding what were supposedly the the hairs from from a Y pe or something Did you see

77
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,856
about the story published by Isaac Al off. No. I I found some stuff about

78
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:22,970
nowhere, actually in nineteen fifty five when while Barks is looking for a Plot for fourteenth Scrooge adventure. And the news report

79
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:30,300
provided in mid long. The stories was really catching on again with reports of a borders which I for

80
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:41,089
of new giant footprints in the tv tibetan mountains and bbc and television made ninety minutes program named the creature, which hammer films two years later,

81
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:50,488
remade into a moving named the bamboo snowman ma'am and the new coast or said worksheet shit with someone brave. A timeless territory to freeze you receipts.

82
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:55,673
That's great. I wonder if that... It's kinda neat how there's, like, it's this...

83
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:06,776
It's one of those ideas that seems to occur in parallel and different cultures, kinda like a dragon and, you know, there's so many cultures that have this, like, head space for a giant

84
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:07,614
mysterious

85
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:23,318
Al ply creature. And you can imagine this coming from, like siding in in like In North America, if you ever investigate any of the sas watch siding, it always ends up being a bear that has lost its hair for some reason.

86
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:30,554
So I imagine in the Is it's probably similar but maybe with the Y or or the like. As far as

87
00:09:31,532 --> 00:09:38,386
one other pop culture thing is that isaac Al of of the famous sci f writer he had a short story, I think, published

88
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:42,277
everest. In the fifties in the early fifties. That helps

89
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:43,475
this

90
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:48,150
where apparently apparently when they... When an expedition discovers

91
00:09:48,584 --> 00:10:09,379
y in the Himalayas, they actually turn out to be martian but they're in the Himalayas because, like, that's the kind of that's the kind of atmosphere they can tolerate I thought that was kinda cool. It. So that's that's kind of the the cultural background that I've got for this one Al I I found surprisingly little about, like, the actual

92
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:12,346
production of the story by Barks.

93
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:16,296
So do you know anything about the production? Well, not much

94
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:20,490
except that. Of course. He watched the news and he got fairly

95
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:30,516
simple straightforward Id for... Yeah. Straightforward treasure. Yeah. It's kinda like explorers go out. They find the pressure and the return and similar fashion

96
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,850
lost world. Yeah. It does

97
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:45,459
seem reminiscent of that. I I gonna talk about it when we get there, but I I find it interesting that this is one of those times It's unusual how screwed is gonna send a team out. Yeah. This is more of

98
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:50,870
getting the t Barks career Right. Not it. It's a recovery mission.

99
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:58,444
I I guess the other bit of historical background, you know, Severino everyone knows who Gin Khan is. Right? The famous

100
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:00,320
leader of the mongols

101
00:11:00,737 --> 00:11:30,216
who ruled over much of eurasia many centuries ago. Now as far as the question, did he have an actual Crown. I I looked that up. No. He did... Doesn't seem to have. I I saw a cool image of of his wife's Crown, and, of course, it doesn't look anything like the one we're gonna see in this story. It's it's a very... It's a very European looking crap. But, yeah, It's it's neat that Barks created a whole treasure. For this. Because now if you like Google, if you just Google the words,

102
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:40,686
crown of gang this Khan it leads to Barks and Ducktales and nothing. Alright. So we always take a moment. I like to take a moment to pan to international listeners.

103
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:49,239
By mentioning some of the title translations from around the world, This one's just not that interesting. I'm... I I really find it intriguing.

104
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:54,495
When they go with kind of one countries and their the translators go with

105
00:11:54,832 --> 00:12:05,272
unexpected titles. But for the most part, this one is just gonna end up being different variations of the lost crown of getting this khan or the the treasure of the ab ama

106
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:06,524
snow monster

107
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,841
or or whatever. So

108
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:19,911
since since I've got a Norwegian guest on Miguel, why don't you tell us the the Norwegian title. Yeah. The no norwegian entitled for the stories but very straight

109
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:26,677
translation is just jen cons top the q, which just means the last chrome of Gen khan. Right.

110
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:30,900
And then I will do... Let's see and...

111
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,700
I... I'm most comfortable with Spanish. So in Spain and Mexico,

112
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,740
this is a very straightforward

113
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:51,160
La corona compared to be they again this kind. That said, let's let's go ahead and launch into the story. Alright. So Mick, the the loss crown of Khan. Now we usually open

114
00:12:51,579 --> 00:13:01,374
with Scrooge in his money Bin. In these adventure choice. And and this one is no different. But it is a little bit different that Scrooge is doing something

115
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:03,054
fairly pedestrian.

116
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:08,013
He is me an old clock that he's got... It's an old

117
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:14,684
pocket watch. Style clock. And he is... He's just listening to it

118
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:22,236
reassuring ticking. And thinking about how much he enjoys this very cheap watch. That helps him go to sleep.

119
00:13:22,574 --> 00:13:29,160
Any he any drifts off to sleep in his pile of money. It's a very... It's a a very neat image.

120
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:34,034
And then Bark uses some narration boxes to transition us

121
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:50,390
away to the other side of the world and he says Can can you tell us about that that narration box? Yeah. Uncle unsecured wouldn't feel so snug if you knew that thousand of miles away the sandals feet of for very runners are petting or the lu

122
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:59,851
of the Inducks mountains bringing bad news. Yeah. And and so we get... We get this trope that we see a lot in in media

123
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:01,405
where it's one messenger

124
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:10,065
past along some information to another messenger in a pretty treacherous place where you can't really use the telephone or anything like that.

125
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:24,198
It's it's very intriguing, I think. What do you think about this this first sequence? Alright. I think it's really interesting. You it certainly brings this sense of mystery. What is this bad news and what is this danger that on the Scrooge

126
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:37,324
meet on this new adventure. So it it really brings the red to the story. I think from on from the very first page. Yeah. I agree. It's it's some good storytelling, right? Because it is both intriguing

127
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:45,244
and it also kinda gives us this neat little preview. Of the setting itself without having to like just use

128
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:46,081
exposition

129
00:14:46,418 --> 00:15:01,215
dialogue to do it. Yeah. I really like first opening panel with Scrooge flying there in the pile of coins because it's it's an early establishing of the stores big you're running joe the sheep watch that costs Scrooge a dollar. Because this is gonna be

130
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:05,224
pretty important Right. Plan. I'm glad you pointed that out because

131
00:15:05,923 --> 00:15:09,260
right away in that very first panel, we can actually

132
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:16,226
quote here, we read the clock ticking and that's gonna be kind of an ever present thing. And

133
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:23,149
it's it's a nice kind of poetic narrator box that introduces it. To a watch that ticks loudly

134
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:37,454
and a strange den of the roof of the world our two men that end danger the safety of uncle Scrooge in his newest adventure. It's it's a very intriguing open too. So on the next page when

135
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:38,852
when the messenger

136
00:15:39,191 --> 00:15:40,850
service, like eventually

137
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:42,747
arrives to uncle Scrooge

138
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:44,225
via telegram,

139
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,139
we we just see him very

140
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:52,234
dismay and surprised saying great stumbling could apostrophe.

141
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:58,094
I hadn't expected this to happen. And and he allude to needing to

142
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:01,659
deal with whatever this matter is in person

143
00:16:02,117 --> 00:16:12,545
and we see him like, he and worrying about how he can trick Donald and the boys. Into joining him because he knows that they wouldn't if asked

144
00:16:12,925 --> 00:16:26,870
and and so while he's pays saying we do transition to Donald and the boys. You wanna tell us make what they're up to? Main meanwhile across tom And his Nephews are watching the news guest. The broadcaster is telling about once again, stories are copying

145
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:41,482
about the mysterious bum snowman asia. They sitting there in the living room and watching television and the new report telling about the footprints of one of the frightening to reach your creatures at the twenty three thousand some feet on the

146
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:45,772
So I like the name of that plateau.

147
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:50,700
It's it's a pun. Right? In in English, it's gas and.

148
00:16:51,480 --> 00:17:16,539
But it definitely kinda has that south Asian South Central Asian field to it. This is a trope that is not... You know, the the whole, like, the story is gonna get explained and you introduce it via a news cast don't think it's the best trope. It it it seems very like happens stands, a little overly coincidental to me but that's fine I think it's actually a good thing because

149
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:17,555
Barks.

150
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:21,580
The the big thing Barks is gonna do, but the story is it's gonna

151
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:34,581
make fun of media of television and how day hyper up stories and kind of make Al legend that's it's not not necessarily true. So for the story and the story Barks want to tell. I think is important to get the

152
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:48,094
in on the beginning. Right you yeah with what I agree with your Barks. That's that's not the best way. But for this particular story, I think it works and it's necessary. You're you're right. You're you're definitely right because it's it's gonna book and with the gag,

153
00:17:48,433 --> 00:18:07,224
the the gag and. So that's a very fair points. So we transition back to screws where he has decided on the next page. So the only... The only option for him is to trick the boys into... Into coming with him. He's gonna promise them, like, enjoy ride on his plane. And then once they get airborne, he admits to Shanghai.

154
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:14,239
But but then he's gonna give them the option if they really want when they arrive at their destination in Al,

155
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:27,770
when they arrive and Ka, they can decide to to go back. Mcgill, this is definitely not the first time that he's tricked them into it. It it feels like one of the more gentle times though that he

156
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:42,225
tricks his nephews into coming on Al adventure. Yeah. Huey, usually often try to rigorous way out of paying them thirty cents an hour and we're also saw in the men the that he then trick them to not even take care payments for

157
00:18:43,179 --> 00:19:00,579
Yeah. This time, it is gently gives them the option of returning home, but then they will feel like they are chicken. So Right. And and after what promises to be, I I would assume, like, a twenty hour plane right? So while while they're in the air and then the net user are annoyed.

158
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:07,012
Screws explains just what the heck is going on. And he tells them about how he had a caravan

159
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:10,421
a month ago, that was in Outer mon

160
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:21,048
crossing the Inducks Push Mountains, and he says that the acts were loaded mostly with hides and wall but that one of them had a treasure of unbelievable richness.

161
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:22,005
And

162
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:28,485
this is the part we had alluded to on the next page he talks about how his agents. He had his agent

163
00:19:28,785 --> 00:19:43,012
scouring Asia for years to find this treasure and and when they... When the caravan van camp out, in an ic pass, the treasure is gonna end up being stolen We already mentioned that it's a little bit weird

164
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:46,505
that you know, Scrooge has his quote agents

165
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:55,080
seeking out a treasure. That's not very... That's not kind of the classic trope that a lot of people who who enjoy these comics

166
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,280
and duck,

167
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:10,506
especially like the second duck series. That's not what they think of when they think Scrooge. Try. He he usually does it directly. Yeah. The new doctor has re reboot made it into that screwed she's even more in for that adventure and for the themselves.

168
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:19,935
Personally thing it's Scrooge is definitely Severino which is for Richard's sake because. Yeah. Yeah. That that that aspect of the second

169
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:24,815
really robbed to me a little bit the wrong way that, like, obsession

170
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:26,270
with Adventure

171
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:50,432
rather than treasure. I I I feel like they they almost wanted to make a show out of the original theme so there. I can definitely see that. I remember the tour that that the top there was basically just Scrooge one to two climb of mount Severino, I think it was and Right. The only only the reason was to prove that it could do it. There was no economical profit to gain from it. So Right.

172
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,051
Isn't

173
00:20:52,964 --> 00:21:01,530
And and so we get a nice little reveal here. Right? Donald is is busting to find out what this fantastic treasure was that

174
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:08,188
quote that you rate it more valuable than hour time. And he reveals that it was the lost

175
00:21:08,524 --> 00:21:10,554
crown of Gen hot.

176
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:18,530
It's a pretty cool panel of two of the she holding up that crown. It's really is. I it's really glowing in my

177
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:24,252
of in my. Yeah. I I would say that this is probably one of the coolest

178
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,165
treasures that the Ducktales have gone after.

179
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:36,735
And and probably, like maybe the need kind of original bark treasure. Because as we say, this is not like a historical or a mythological

180
00:21:37,355 --> 00:21:40,866
artifact. But it just... It's just feels I icon. Definitely.

181
00:21:41,324 --> 00:21:46,652
And and it's got a really cool look to it. Al as a duct fan, I feel like the look of the actual

182
00:21:47,164 --> 00:22:00,390
treasure itself is really iconic as well. I also really like the pacing of how Bark has screws reveal what's happened, you know, that he goes on to explain that something has happened to the treasure

183
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,242
during the night in the Ic pass, the crown was somehow

184
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:13,005
stole. And and he basically wraps it up by saying he needs their help to to track it down. Yeah. I can we can also mention that.

185
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,380
Here do

186
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:44,855
Ask how did your agents happen to find it. Al to huge just transfer never mind that's a story for another time. Right now, I'm more interested in finding it again. And of course, Don Rosa would make an explanation for how the agents found the crown and back do some rights that could say. Yeah. Well, and will definitely get into that follow ups story as well. I... I'm definitely excited to talk about that one. And and then I guess I should also mention that Scrooge

187
00:22:45,415 --> 00:22:47,895
description of the crown is pretty interesting.

188
00:22:48,495 --> 00:23:03,365
What is the what is notable about the crown itself? Yeah. Yeah. It's crust with Al thousand jewels, one for every city that it conquered. So that's neat little flourish. Right? That that makes the crown, I think, feel even more

189
00:23:04,025 --> 00:23:05,645
special, more impactful

190
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,570
Right? It it feels... Now it feels like Al even more bloody.

191
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:12,879
Fact. Yeah. We can we start to fastest

192
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:18,915
about all the people that's not the one time to do for every new. Right. Because,

193
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:22,226
you know, it it is it's definitely not legend

194
00:23:22,643 --> 00:23:24,937
about how the khan went about conquering.

195
00:23:26,565 --> 00:23:27,065
Cities.

196
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:29,035
So when they do arrive in Al,

197
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:33,814
you know, the the the Ducktales have not been convinced initially.

198
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,199
It sounds like too much of a task for them. But

199
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:39,116
as

200
00:23:39,612 --> 00:23:42,918
as they see screws walking off, on his own.

201
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:46,587
They they they do kind of predictably

202
00:23:47,044 --> 00:23:52,585
start to feel, you know, guilty about letting an old duck go off and the awful now alone.

203
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:59,630
What do you think Miguel about about what the Nephews say here? I I love this plan this impressive

204
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:07,774
I love this part of the story. And the boys say besides, we are not cities. Turbo brown is short ton. And then they're really

205
00:24:08,152 --> 00:24:21,614
research and wait on the, we'd like a crocodile adventures sells and Scrooge things hey I knew that come along and like, I really like the fly smile and Scrooge choice in this panel because it really looks.

206
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:45,811
Yeah. It is fun seeing that. Live version of Scrooge who knows how to get what he wants and and make make the other characters think it was their idea. So I I don't know if it carries over in Norwegian, but the word sis That's something that was like it it hasn't really aged well. These days, but it was like, super common lingo back in the fifties and sixties

207
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:53,515
and later, it's it's a word for, like, an a feminine little boy. It would be coded as It would be coded as a little bit home homophobic.

208
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:57,498
Today, it wasn't like specifically thinking about

209
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:07,855
about that because, like, that wasn't even talked about that. But but it definitely had that kind of coding. But again, you you could find that in any number of comments from this time. So

210
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:22,981
I I like this term roof of the world for the Himalayas is. Right? We'll see that in the comics a few times and now we see the docs para out over the roof of the world, and we transition pretty quickly to the site where the crown

211
00:25:23,717 --> 00:25:29,773
disappear. Where it's just one guard who's kinda stations to keep the clues intact.

212
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:31,384
And we see Scrooge

213
00:25:31,942 --> 00:25:34,765
talk at him in in local language, which

214
00:25:35,544 --> 00:25:39,636
I think Barks is using some basically chicken scratch to to represent,

215
00:25:40,094 --> 00:25:42,968
but but at least we're spared from any kind of, like,

216
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:44,267
gibberish

217
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:45,638
like language.

218
00:25:46,015 --> 00:25:49,945
I did some research on on Al language area. And I I think we're

219
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,059
want this to be

220
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:54,172
most likely the she power

221
00:25:54,605 --> 00:26:01,416
cher bar or share language, which is the the basic language spoken in And the Indian status of

222
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:02,487
Severino

223
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:08,825
mainly by the She. It's definitely not real writing, but it it bears some similar similarities or

224
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:14,585
resemblance at least to the to the written language and... But, yeah, it's basically

225
00:26:14,965 --> 00:26:47,724
chicken writing, but it's not just awful as a first thought it's possible. Right. Yeah. You're right. It definitely... It definitely looks in Al line. I can't remember the name of the language family. It's like Lost tibetan or something. But but but but it it is reasonable to say that the the depiction of the She of people and and throughout this story is generally pretty respectful. It's it's pretty fine. For the nine fifties. Yeah So that won't be an issue in this story. No. I would also like to say that it could also be asian.

226
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:51,616
I don't think so but we know that from Sol laurent then Scrooge.

227
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:55,842
Could speak to native language of the alliance that's... We learned

228
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:03,425
language when it was a york buyer and. So probably right the same. Yeah. It's it's kind of interesting, Tell how much Barks

229
00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:11,378
returns to this, like, pretty small area of the world. Right? There's we've got we've got this story

230
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,256
and we've bought Trauma lot

231
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,533
and each other... Oh

232
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:22,468
unicorn. Try Al of the unicorn. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And so trail, the unicorn,

233
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:26,090
So... He's really... He's really interested in this region

234
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:31,315
This isn't a neat reveal. Right? Why don't you tell us about what the

235
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:42,992
the guide leads them to? Yeah. So the she go ahead is leading Scrooge if you up to a blanket since snow. The spirit says, they preserved the tea straps in the snow wonder that blankets. And then the She,

236
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,460
what's under there and dongle

237
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,580
experience yeah chats, but short what sort of beast made those prints and we have this three towed

238
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,380
clog

239
00:27:52,774 --> 00:28:01,716
huge footprints and the kids and don't are looking scared, but huge more normal annoyed or something or kinda for I would say.

240
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:07,430
It's not a beast voice, but maybe you're not a man either, and then sku turns around looking

241
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,230
total

242
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:21,120
and say, it's like the message said the Wonder Mca Caravan drivers were afraid to go after that teeth. What do mean saying, don't. Excuse. Turns around again and say, don't are tracks on a bum snowman.

243
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,520
Don't then phone Severino. No heat answers.

244
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:34,407
Right. I like kelly actually falls over from fear. So this is a pretty cool moment. Right? It's a neat reveal and and screws is really tricked to them into something.

245
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:51,335
Pretty pretty frightening. Those and those footprints really do look very ominous and suspense. It works really does a good job of bringing up the suspense. Earlier. That's gonna be important. Right. And and so the docks take a little bit of time to kinda reconcile what kind of terrible

246
00:28:51,848 --> 00:28:53,623
mission they've been rope into

247
00:28:54,398 --> 00:29:05,129
and screws reminds them that they've committed to it. So they they kinda go and and proceed up the mountain, and they they eventually get to a spot where the

248
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:14,220
snowman traps have been disappeared have disappeared marked by a steak and they're they're looking around and thinking to themselves. How could it possibly

249
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,180
disappear? How can you go here from here

250
00:29:17,694 --> 00:29:56,661
without leaving any more footprints. So that's an intriguing way to continue this. It's also something that Barks built from the real adventures documented in the news because the footprints wood often So the docks, you know, they proceed on and on, they they go up the mountain to try to look for more trash. And and they do find them and the tracks seem to be pretty fresh. And this is where this is where Scrooge is why is gonna come back and play. Right? Because as he manages them to be quiet so that we can sneak up on them, Barks reminds us of that pocket watch with the little on

251
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:58,096
tick to.

252
00:29:58,553 --> 00:30:04,357
Hey. What's the On pi in Norwegian for a clock ticking set? It would be tick

253
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:05,409
thick.

254
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:07,284
So this same.

255
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,278
Yeah. Yeah. It's just.

256
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:12,947
We use Tiktok as well. And and so Donald,

257
00:30:13,483 --> 00:30:23,903
Donald kinda highlights the problem. He says that it out loud. He says, if you expect to be quiet, you better do something about that watch. I can hear it ticking away back here.

258
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:32,667
This this is a great Scrooge moment. Right? Make I'll tell us, tell us about this this internal debate. Yeah. And Scrooge Gladstone at his workshop

259
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:34,381
without very worried

260
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:42,825
expression and I can't do anything about till runs down. Certainly throw away thing that cost the dollar says is a great Barks.

261
00:30:43,543 --> 00:30:54,920
It is. It's very silly, but it's also like it's screws and not shell. Right? He can't bring himself to throw this away. Even if it's gonna be a big problem. We we have a saying in English

262
00:30:55,578 --> 00:31:19,078
penny wise and pound foolish. That's kind of what screws is like a lot of the time. So eventually, they do lose the tracks and he doesn't really have to worry about about what to do about the watch right away. And and the Nephews comment that he couldn't have jumped to another crash this time, the the monster must have either flown... He had to fly or turn invisible. And

263
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:21,492
Like Barks makes this

264
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:23,501
logical and practical

265
00:31:24,077 --> 00:31:43,543
reasoning. Not the dogs ask themselves, like, Did they fly away or poke could do? Well can you just manage those Barks, of course, later we'll have a practical reason for why the snowman man is able to do so. Right. Exact. Clean. And it's worth mentioning, you know that we've left the She behind. So we're we're just the five docks.

266
00:31:44,221 --> 00:32:17,735
Going steadily up this this himalayan Mountain, you know, they've got their... They've got their like version of winter gear on, but but they feel really small and really helpless. And I think that heightened the tension pretty nice. Yeah. It could be interesting to have the She out as an actual character that follows on, but he wouldn't really be necessary and Barks, of course, wesley focus on the main characters and it makes it not dangerous interest. It's it's only them. They don't have. They don't have a local to save them guide them. Right. And and they're definitely out of their elements.

267
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:20,887
So so what happens as they

268
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:22,405
as they

269
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,721
start to go up the mountain and and we see

270
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:39,640
slash here, screws just watch ticking again. Well, that's Scrooge is trying to... Was starting to climb up the mountains side and don't come have this little funny Barks that. Some, someday will run out of mountain.

271
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,960
And then huge snow slides

272
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:42,800
bur

273
00:32:43,274 --> 00:33:03,430
under snow and then they dig themselves out of it and one of the Nephews say, there's snow mandate that he's trying to stop us and it seems to know exactly where we are at all time. So we never see him. And then don't of course, say that's of course, in knows where we are. You can spot this whether that com from the watch, like I said.

274
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:05,765
It's it's a fun moment.

275
00:33:06,302 --> 00:33:08,610
I like seeing screws looking Al cheap

276
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:09,608
here.

277
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:36,875
And and Mick, we got another great scene here. Another very Scrooge scene. What's what's his solution? How does he wanna fix this problem? Well, it doesn't we don't want to throw away. A very expensive workshop. He decides to camp there for the nights. To give the clock some time to run down. And I like Donald comment. You wanna tell Donald comment? What's the solution? With a million dollar kronos steak, he loses a whole nice to save a book

278
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:57,995
Al it's great. This again feels like a very Scrooge moment. And I really like the drawing the art of the Ducktales like, all cozy heat up in in their campsite, you know, with the, like, special sleeping bags this a little bit of nice attention to detail. That Barks goes through. And again, we got a great comic beat here

279
00:33:58,655 --> 00:34:10,032
Tell me how the page wraps up. Well, the they're snuggle look in there bag well screwed say, oh oh, and one of the boys runs server over to and what's wrong of the pittsburgh and then we here tick

280
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:13,900
I forgot some wound that com from watch.

281
00:34:15,098 --> 00:34:15,598
Right.

282
00:34:16,057 --> 00:34:20,844
So he's done he's the thing that I think we probably find pretty

283
00:34:21,182 --> 00:34:21,682
identifiable,

284
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:30,364
right? You're like thinking to yourself Oh, I'd better I'd better go ahead and make I don't do this one thing. And then we totally absent minded

285
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:33,125
do it on on auto pilot.

286
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,385
Right? This is super relatable.

287
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:36,737
But it's also

288
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:41,165
it's also very funny. I also think this is the point where the gloves

289
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,771
disappears. For the rest of the story? Yeah. He just kinda stops

290
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:52,597
drawing their gloves in. Right? We're we're not meant to think that it's taken by the the snowman or anything.

291
00:34:54,355 --> 00:35:03,104
This is just bark subtly, maybe being tired of drawing with the docks with them or perhaps forgetting and deciding, you know, not to go back.

292
00:35:03,444 --> 00:35:20,764
Because most readers are not gonna notice I I didn't really notice until you brought No it also makes it easier to draw the the fingers and because the Inducks are no just running around in their everyday clothing. Right. Right? And there will probably be some scenes where they need to,

293
00:35:21,064 --> 00:35:27,699
you know, use their their digits more. So I like that we don't have to deal with another day or anything

294
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:35,431
because the the problem of the clock has essentially been taken away by the next page. Because it disappears

295
00:35:36,128 --> 00:36:00,481
overnight. At first, they think that it stopped ticking but then when Scrooge goes to to look for it, he realizes that it's It's been stolen and we see more of those ominous and and I I will say they're pretty scary. Those those big footprints show that the monster was in there camp last night. And so the docs go to follow him because it should be much easier.

296
00:36:00,818 --> 00:36:01,757
And and

297
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:07,832
but they're gonna have a quick breakfast first to build up their strength. And Scrooge notices

298
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:10,880
Hue is the Nephew named.

299
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:18,635
Has cottage it chill. Yeah. It's also... It worth it's worth noting that Box takes time to actually have the dog breakfast.

300
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:22,898
And don't say, just a minute we can't go battling ten foot

301
00:36:23,276 --> 00:36:24,233
without our breakfast.

302
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:43,071
And how many woman Cartoon were comic group routers would actually take time to to just throw this neat little logical thing to do into the story. Right. I I like that that line of dialogue on a lot. I'm glad you noted that. And and when I think about why he did that, I think

303
00:36:43,408 --> 00:36:44,227
he probably

304
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:49,035
wanted this snacks I think he probably liked the idea of building

305
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,755
suspense by having the Nephew being

306
00:36:52,055 --> 00:36:55,689
seated and developing, you know, these fear chills

307
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:56,888
because

308
00:36:57,346 --> 00:37:03,000
this is a tense moment, and we need the dots to be kind of still. So that they can all

309
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:06,035
here the sound of the watch.

310
00:37:06,355 --> 00:37:10,150
Ticking. It's a neat... It's a neat little a moment. Right? It definitely is

311
00:37:10,648 --> 00:37:16,791
the doctors are breakfast and Scrooge is pouring up some either coffee or tea and yes.

312
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:21,581
Such she here, you have you caught a shoe and he is

313
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:31,910
looking really scared sitting there and... No. I've just got the sons in my pill air. Your watch taking, and then we her have this tiny little writing

314
00:37:34,704 --> 00:37:37,158
Yeah. It's a testament to Barks storytelling,

315
00:37:37,695 --> 00:37:40,548
right? That he can make that little on pi

316
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:47,810
that you can't even hear that you have to read very very frightening and very suspense. And and so Scrooge

317
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:51,430
is is not scared very long. He

318
00:37:51,730 --> 00:38:05,018
decides to run at the monster behind the wall of rocks that he's stuck that. Intending to las out ham with just just a rope just to la. But again, The monster plow some snow on them. We we

319
00:38:05,514 --> 00:38:13,085
as we have this whole story, we still haven't gotten Al glimpse to him. And he vanish again without leaving a single

320
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:26,551
footprint. So again, we get one of these moments where they're pondering this mystery. How could this be paused well, how can you just disappear? And then one of the nephews figures that figures it out. You wanna tell us what he

321
00:38:27,064 --> 00:38:29,002
discover miguel? Well, with the

322
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:33,876
magnifying glass, that's I guess, every good will bring within wherever.

323
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:45,188
I've got it, ma'am. I sold the mystery. He explains that the snowman man covers his tricks by dragging a white animal fur behind him. See. Faint drug Barks and white tears.

324
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:57,080
And know screws looking real surprised twice. I'll be gray bearded hoop old. Make, I really like I really like the solution to this mystery. I think this is a really satisfying

325
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,980
explanation. You know, sometimes when you get mysteries in these comments,

326
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:10,188
the the the solution feels a little bit convoluted. And this is neat. Yeah really. And we obviously we got the the next solution to the rest of the

327
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:13,524
of how we can climb so forth. Right.

328
00:39:14,363 --> 00:39:17,535
Yeah. So we're we're at this next part where the Ducktales

329
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:20,275
discover a y hair row,

330
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:23,355
and they figure out that they must be at

331
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,515
Scrooge calls at

332
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,730
his home must be at the top of the Scotch

333
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:32,090
staircase case. Al interesting little turn of phrase.

334
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:46,849
And he did I gloss over the part where he talks the first time about mid with big feet? Is that something that they alluded to? Yeah. Here one is running up with the last so size. It's probably a with big feeds.

335
00:39:47,729 --> 00:39:50,029
Alright. Right. So, you know, Donald

336
00:39:50,463 --> 00:40:02,957
cautions him. He he tells him, hey, that's a risky way to go calling. Even on quote mid with big feet, which he, you know, he had supposed previously is how is how he escapes so fast.

337
00:40:03,594 --> 00:40:07,380
This is a word that is just not politely used in English.

338
00:40:08,154 --> 00:40:14,565
Anymore. It was in totally common use at the time, so I'm not gonna like... I'm not gonna cast

339
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:17,254
any shade of Barks for using this.

340
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:31,609
But that's the only time I will use it. You know, he even had that word in, like, the title of some of a later story. But but again, we just say little person now. Okay. You know, Scrooge. This plays out pretty quickly Scrooge

341
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:32,349
sees

342
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:34,906
a harry and

343
00:40:35,245 --> 00:40:40,955
terrifying looking arm reach over the edge and shake him down to the bottom

344
00:40:41,295 --> 00:40:48,515
of of this ledge. Do you wanna tell us about what what happens on the next page? Scrooge only here only falls not giving Al little

345
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:51,723
Yeah. Well, Scrooge just phoned down and

346
00:40:52,301 --> 00:41:12,453
he looks surprisingly happy because his home is up there. Alright. I could see the front of a cave and don't looking worried staring up the mountains and I'd say, Well, we'll have to see you strategy to get into that place. And then we get this view of of the cave and I cliffs side right outside it and the tax

347
00:41:13,032 --> 00:41:15,784
noticed that there is a oppressive recipes piece

348
00:41:16,161 --> 00:41:36,231
bow from which we could log or ourselves his ledge. And this row will reach Come on. Right. And so they they managed to lower themselves from above, and they're able to kinda sneak up on him. And around the bend, they actually see them on but he's covered himself with his his fur blanket.

349
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:46,116
And and Miguel, that that image to me is really chilling. Right? Because it kind of... It's it's very still. It's very suspense.

350
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:48,628
We're still at the point of imagining

351
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:58,889
what the monster looks like underneath. So I I think it's very scary. It's really it's a really area panel because we see that it is large. Is tall.

352
00:41:59,607 --> 00:42:17,200
You still don't know who. What his? And so while he's outside of his cave, they're able to sneak into it and you know, find out more about him. And as they enter, we see kind of a lot of junk. Right? There's some bones and what looks to be like A mammoth tu,

353
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,900
some hides and some various, like, tools and implements that he must have gotten over the years.

354
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:29,715
And and it's just a bunch of cheap tri in junk as screwed says on the next page.

355
00:42:30,155 --> 00:42:34,923
He seems to be a big collector of hat because he has a number of local hats there.

356
00:42:35,682 --> 00:42:44,253
And then Donald allude to a jewel cole bucket. That he's tossed in the corner, calling him a dim width. And

357
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:49,216
and then we get a panel of Scrooge, just totally, like, with a very goofy expression.

358
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:58,843
Telling him that's no coal bucket you've doubled in with. That's the lost crown of Gen Khan. That's it's pretty cool. It's a very satisfying

359
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:05,970
moment where they they find the treasure. It's really nice. Al like screws tongue is hanging out his mouth. Or.

360
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:10,910
Yeah. And and meanwhile, the Nephews have been waiting outside standing lookout.

361
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,730
And they're getting nervous

362
00:43:13,364 --> 00:43:40,900
and they're commenting that, you know, at least we'll hear the watch ticking if the snowman comes back. And then in nearly the same moment, one of them comments that he thinks he does hear it now And and the reader does see again that triple tech tick tech on a p. And when happens? Well, this huge fur blanket we have already already seen being carried, but snowman is thrown over the Nephews, and we see these large hairy arms and digits

363
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:41,740
floors

364
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,255
towing up the the fur into a huge. Barks

365
00:43:45,335 --> 00:43:48,795
with the Nephews inside, and Barks once again, use this visual

366
00:43:49,415 --> 00:43:56,490
where visual way to show them that we can hardly hear Nephew. There's the sound is muffled by this tiny little board

367
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:03,115
hell. Hell. How screwed save yourself. Yeah. Yeah. It's a neat way of of indicating the mu.

368
00:44:03,952 --> 00:44:08,877
So again, we're we're amp up the fear. We're amp up the dread

369
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:20,793
the nephews have been caught and we know that, you know, screws and donald are moments away from this kind of danger as well And so and so the bigger reveal. Yes.

370
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:25,560
Yes. The big reveal, I I can I can barely

371
00:44:26,137 --> 00:44:28,931
contain my self Mick from from making a

372
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:30,770
sound here?

373
00:44:31,911 --> 00:44:40,056
Donald, we we transitioned back to the cave where Donald says I hear muffled sounds outside. Come on. The kids may be in trouble

374
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:46,378
and sp, you know, is still focused on the crown and and and they start to rush out.

375
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:48,895
I

376
00:44:49,793 --> 00:44:50,852
I... It's really.

377
00:44:51,725 --> 00:45:06,000
I'm sure that this works. I don't know if this works for you. I... This this must work for some readers. But I I think it works because I know what Barks is up to and I will go more into that in detail later with It is goofy.

378
00:45:07,553 --> 00:45:19,890
Is incredibly goofy. I... I'm excited to hear your thoughts and your inside about it. But but let me let me go ahead and describe him We We see Uncle Scrooge and Donald. They've got the snowman

379
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:27,981
looming over them, and they have a very Barks draws them in a Al a astonished pose, and the snowman

380
00:45:28,399 --> 00:45:39,334
stands he looks to be about eight to ten feet tall, and he's just as goofy as all get out. I mean, even if not for the fact that he's just wearing this random

381
00:45:39,673 --> 00:45:41,550
launch of goofy clothes,

382
00:45:42,004 --> 00:45:44,259
that the shape of his head is...

383
00:45:44,636 --> 00:45:48,046
It's almost diamond shape. He has these enormous ears,

384
00:45:48,504 --> 00:45:51,810
nose ring, all these mismatched accessories

385
00:45:52,387 --> 00:45:56,239
all over him, a goofy little tu of hair. It is

386
00:45:56,577 --> 00:46:01,485
For me, it is this weird mix of of let down

387
00:46:01,905 --> 00:46:02,405
and

388
00:46:02,825 --> 00:46:05,525
I mean, it's comic. It's it's goofy

389
00:46:05,825 --> 00:46:06,925
and the humorous

390
00:46:07,305 --> 00:46:08,300
and it sub

391
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,820
the the fear and the dread that we've been

392
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:23,830
experiencing for most of the story, but I I gotta a same call. I'm I'm reminded. I really like my structure for this podcast. Right? Because I've never really gone through these sequential.

393
00:46:24,568 --> 00:46:36,050
And it was just a couple of episodes ago that that I covered that I covered the golden fleece six. Yeah. Yeah and this story it makes me think about the golden placing many anyways because Barks got

394
00:46:36,826 --> 00:47:05,049
the editors told him that the lord... The lower were suggestive of madness and we got Al lot of complaints. So in a way, I kinda wonder if he just so I'll make this monster so as little scary as possible because of that I think I think that your position there is right. I think that must be what happened. Right? Because it's it's the same sort of situation I think that the golden fleece does such a great sense of building up.

395
00:47:05,426 --> 00:47:08,695
It builds up this great sense of dread so effectively

396
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:16,686
for the majority of the story for at least the first half of the story. And then when we actually get to because, it's for this cooking.

397
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:33,475
And it's it's very invent, and it's very funny, but I do feel like it deflate a lot of that build. And I don't think this one has quite Al scary a build. Although it is, there there's a great sense of, like, creeping dread in the first part of the story.

398
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:40,423
And then it's like he just lets the air out of the room with this big reveal of this just

399
00:47:40,762 --> 00:47:41,262
impossible

400
00:47:41,761 --> 00:47:53,326
goof fee. Goofy creature. I don't I don't like the creature design yet. No. It's definitely not the best box. So It makes me think a little about to sleep dragon and the golden,

401
00:47:53,703 --> 00:47:56,834
which also looks kinda beautiful. But

402
00:47:57,172 --> 00:47:59,187
it looks cooler do is

403
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:00,462
everyone is calling

404
00:48:00,974 --> 00:48:07,015
the snowman and the store good because it's one one of two war warranty you.

405
00:48:07,353 --> 00:48:10,620
It can say you or reboot? Yes. But I think

406
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,620
he captures Scrooge and is nephews. And when they are minutes later

407
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:26,040
behind bars and looking at this legend of the mountains. I think we get to the point of why Barks choose to make making into this anti anticlimactic

408
00:48:28,893 --> 00:48:35,994
screws comments, I can tell you that I'm not pleased based of what I see. It Barks cunning snowman, the legendary

409
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:45,400
of the top piece and then we switched over in the next panel to this snowman sitting there with a mirror and local screws top ups on top of his head.

410
00:48:46,260 --> 00:49:03,646
Al looking at himself, like Al like a little child. Right. And it's it's a funny little comment that Scrooge makes. Right? Yeah. It definitely is and where he says, he says my hat has never sat on a smaller brain. The docs are just totally

411
00:49:04,185 --> 00:49:14,597
disgusted. So, Make Al, I'm curious what, what do you think? Barb is going for here. Is is this is it supposed to be like this sort of paper tiger

412
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:19,874
situation where, you know, this this feared opponents, This feared

413
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:35,665
just turns out to be nothing. Is it like the disappointment? What what do you think he's going for? What do you think he's trying to say by doing this. I think the Barks is trying to make fun of the media and it is likely Barks or your navy or the meter

414
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:36,805
twists things.

415
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:45,040
That is why it turns the to a joke. Since the maid the other time was doing their best to this cunning beasts of terror,

416
00:49:45,454 --> 00:49:47,707
and the ending makes it pretty clear that

417
00:49:48,203 --> 00:49:50,973
this is what Barks was aiming for. Because the meter

418
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:51,850
fabric

419
00:49:52,187 --> 00:50:04,565
stories to to sell newspapers to make people watch solution. And I would say it's a relevant subject even today. Then they need definitely make room makes thing makeup stories.

420
00:50:04,965 --> 00:50:28,260
Sure. I like that take. I'm not sure. I totally agree with it, but I that's a really valid take on it. I wonder if Barks just kinda liked the idea of, you know, def our expectations like that, or maybe like you were saying he he really was trying to kind of forest stall any of that editor push back you know, you can't make him too scary.

421
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:36,075
It's almost like he feels like he now in this era and this era of storytelling. He only he has like this quota of

422
00:50:36,855 --> 00:50:37,355
frightening

423
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,195
scenes

424
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:52,133
that he's allowed to use, and he's almost used it up, and and it's you know, the dell promise to parents doesn't isn't gonna allow for it to be that scary at the end. I I mean, I think your take is definitely right in the he is definitely

425
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:53,808
mocking the media.

426
00:50:54,345 --> 00:51:10,565
But but I feel like it's... It comes more to play at the end here. Yeah. It's definitely not to be ending. Which show way to come on, but I think you're right. I think it is more of a combination of the two. It's yeah can't make it too scary. And it's always taking good care to not make it. Two series

427
00:51:10,905 --> 00:51:12,645
in the old castle secrets

428
00:51:13,305 --> 00:51:14,445
still keeps it

429
00:51:14,945 --> 00:51:15,445
safely

430
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:18,140
on the on the children's side of

431
00:51:19,555 --> 00:51:23,101
not making it into fully fledged horror movie. Right.

432
00:51:24,177 --> 00:51:28,241
Edges just line a little more there. Yeah. And this time, it really...

433
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:31,634
I I think I was getting tired of power

434
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:32,472
western

435
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:33,549
of

436
00:51:33,887 --> 00:51:34,747
next hate

437
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:44,062
Yeah. I I think you're right. So I am gonna I'm gonna pick it up just a little bit here. We get we get kind of this scene that I would call an and tips

438
00:51:44,455 --> 00:51:49,836
seen, you know, the Inducks are worrying, they're very fearful about what he's gonna do with them while

439
00:51:50,336 --> 00:51:51,556
while the snow monster

440
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,085
is messing around with

441
00:51:54,462 --> 00:52:22,427
the things that he's gotten from them. And and he quickly figures out that the watch is something new and special, and it becomes his favorite toy because he just loves the tick, you know, we see him holding it up to his Barks. We see him seeming to dance with it and he is so into it. It he actually covers himself with his big fur blanket. So that you can focus on the ticking, which gives the docs a chance to

442
00:52:22,805 --> 00:52:23,305
physically

443
00:52:23,762 --> 00:52:24,262
bust

444
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,378
through the wooden cage

445
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:31,266
doors that they had been in. And and escape with the

446
00:52:31,685 --> 00:52:46,474
with the crown and and Scrooge is top half fortunately. And so we we do have this last moment though of tension before actually escaping because when the docs arrived, they noticed that their rope is gone

447
00:52:46,812 --> 00:52:51,874
that the snowman has taken it and so when they go to use his role,

448
00:52:52,291 --> 00:53:08,151
he encounters them and he gives one more goo with a with a big broad smile, though. It seems like maybe he's not He's not too intimidating initially. But then he is gonna look... He's he's probably gonna look about his scariest on the next page.

449
00:53:08,646 --> 00:53:16,511
Right, Mi miguel, this is a this is a tense situation tell us about it. We have Scrooge on this nephew standing right there on the edge with this huge shadow of

450
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:27,926
looming towards them with out stretch fingers and it's the bare cage for us for keep as donald and some Scrooge Barks but below money, I will never see it again.

451
00:53:28,882 --> 00:53:31,194
Sure she sure has his p priorities.

452
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:32,947
He always does.

453
00:53:33,521 --> 00:53:36,538
Yeah. So they're they're Inducks mu over whether

454
00:53:37,197 --> 00:53:47,776
whether or not to jump Doesn't seem like a bad idea. Right? People can survive. Like falling into these snow drift. But then Scrooge has this this

455
00:53:48,113 --> 00:53:48,613
idea.

456
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:55,581
This kinda reminds me of the, like, trope of of the solar eclipse, right, impress

457
00:53:56,441 --> 00:54:09,347
you know, the... Maybe a time traveler predicts a solar eclipse or something. Kinda of what I was reminded of. Because tell us about what Scrooge is gonna realize. Well, the clock... It's uncle unscrew pocket Barks that's Karl

458
00:54:09,981 --> 00:54:15,241
cleverly introduced in the very first panel. Now it really comes into play. Mh. Because some,

459
00:54:15,581 --> 00:54:20,576
it predicts that it's gonna stop any minute now. So we it points up

460
00:54:21,236 --> 00:54:23,736
Al snowman who now has this angry

461
00:54:24,236 --> 00:54:28,711
expression on face it's not playing around and anymore no he's angry. Right. And,

462
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,428
I put on the show power watch

463
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:32,507
and

464
00:54:34,205 --> 00:54:34,705
click

465
00:54:35,364 --> 00:54:35,864
Right.

466
00:54:36,402 --> 00:54:37,462
Very conveniently.

467
00:54:38,135 --> 00:54:38,994
Runs out,

468
00:54:39,929 --> 00:54:43,657
you know, this must... This is one of those watches. And

469
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:46,168
I found this really believable.

470
00:54:46,561 --> 00:54:48,259
Right? Because to me, it seems

471
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:56,906
sensible. Scrooge is so invested in in his little this seems like very character with Scrooge knowing down to the second

472
00:54:57,565 --> 00:55:01,980
when his watch might run out. And we got this neat little scene of him negotiating

473
00:55:02,479 --> 00:55:05,137
with the monster using sign language

474
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:09,658
making a deal to put the ladder down so that they can escape.

475
00:55:10,713 --> 00:55:11,851
And we get one

476
00:55:12,189 --> 00:55:14,323
one last panel from a distance.

477
00:55:14,755 --> 00:55:23,509
Of the snowman dancing happily to the ticking and them saying, you know, we better be far away before that watch runs down again. And

478
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:59,661
and this is gonna bring us to the final scene of the story. Make Al why don't you tell us about how it closes Yeah. We are now back into the back home Inducks bergen and we see plane in Scrooge this nephew surviving and a group of people is awaiting them and saying here comes Scrooge token and his nephews home from the Inducks crush Mountains. The papers came they had from tax the adventure. Let me true. I'm a reporter. So heavy now really get Barks commentary the media there because Scrooge coming off to the plane saying I did the folks. I recovered the lost chrome of the great king

479
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:05,674
camp and it starts to show the pointing Al the duo and explaining it there's a root

480
00:56:06,332 --> 00:56:21,886
and diamond for every sixty that com. And then they get this pricing twist to depend the journalists and the people say, who and the jewels have threw on the chromebook youngest camp. We want to hear about goo, the vulnerable snowman with screws is very she is

481
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:23,246
confused

482
00:56:23,586 --> 00:56:27,566
confused expression breaking the fork wall looking at the riots.

483
00:56:27,986 --> 00:56:36,601
Yeah. He kinda... He he does. He breaks the fourth while he gets one of those reaction shots, those like, can you believe this folks?

484
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:43,030
As you say, it it does seem to be kind of a commentary on the sensational

485
00:56:43,489 --> 00:56:46,786
media I would say it's not one of Barks strongest.

486
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:50,034
Endings. No. It doesn't have isn't really

487
00:56:50,412 --> 00:57:01,076
gag more of a surprise, more of a commentary on people doesn't want truth they want a good story and right. Yeah. Even though... I mean, let's face it. Like, the actual

488
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:23,741
the treasure is is both things too. And it's the truth and it's a great yarn, but I can definitely imagine myself. Being, you know, this is encrypted if someone found a real script, I would wanna hear about it. Too. It's interesting that the story that the Ducktales story seems to have also reached them ahead of time, right, to the point where they know that he's named goo.

489
00:57:24,299 --> 00:57:30,239
It's it's all it's all very goofy. It's it's it's a very silly broad ending

490
00:57:30,737 --> 00:57:31,237
to

491
00:57:31,973 --> 00:57:35,027
to you know, what... What's a pretty fine

492
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:43,336
adequate bark story, I think. Mh Yeah. Definitely something of Barks, absolutely strongest ones. I I personally think it's

493
00:57:43,992 --> 00:57:51,824
middle of this three. It's a it's a good story, but it's more of case or is definitely not the with the plastics from the early fifties.

494
00:57:52,382 --> 00:57:54,570
Yeah. We are moving out of Barks

495
00:57:55,427 --> 00:58:02,223
golden nature. I'll still think it if I'm going to be strict, I would say four four eight to fifty five is per definite

496
00:58:02,535 --> 00:58:09,957
golden age. But I also liked the airs of fifty six and fifty seven. I think he made many good stories there like land of the big,

497
00:58:10,317 --> 00:58:10,476
indian,

498
00:58:11,647 --> 00:58:29,171
Yeah. The second british stuck and land the underneath to ground. But after nineteen fifty seven, I would say it definitely has scotland to the end Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right. As you say, he's he's still gonna show, like, frequent flashes of brilliance, there's gonna be some other classic still coming up. We just don't have that, like,

499
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:30,470
consistent

500
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:31,470
brilliance

501
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:44,601
Mentally, I kinda think about, like, late forty eight through fifty five is fifty four is kind of my mental marker. But again, it's it's like it's it's like a plotted distribution graph. Right? Like,

502
00:58:45,801 --> 00:58:54,635
you're gonna have... They're all kinda clustered in there, and you're still gonna have frequent great stories. This one is... It it definitely shows

503
00:58:55,096 --> 00:59:00,655
some moments that are really clever. It's got some neat pacing. It's got some neat elements.

504
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,485
But boy. That weird monster

505
00:59:03,903 --> 00:59:06,478
really leaves a sour taste

506
00:59:07,096 --> 00:59:24,441
for me. It's just it's so... It's so incredibly odd and I just don't... I just don't like the creature design. I think it's that combination right of like, yes. He's goofy. And and I also don't like the creature design if if it was just one of those,

507
00:59:25,255 --> 00:59:38,347
I think I would've have I would have taken it a little bit better. That's I think Barks took a little light on the research for what what's this. Yeah. If this supposedly look like he he got to tall for heads up and described it to her, but

508
00:59:38,804 --> 00:59:46,895
it doesn't really look eight like either. It's more like a a brain charlotte of Barks. Yeah. It's it's very... It's kinda Huey,

509
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:56,641
it's almost like Ne and thor or something. I don't know. It's it doesn't it doesn't really work for me. I do feel like the story is pretty memorable.

510
00:59:56,955 --> 01:00:01,095
You know, I like the... I like the clock ticking element of it. It's...

511
01:00:01,395 --> 01:00:06,670
I I guess this is around the same time that that was a plot point in

512
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:07,950
Peter pan

513
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:10,630
I mean, that goes back. I'm I'm thinking

514
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:11,550
in the

515
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:16,645
adaptation. Right. Never smile or crocodile the dial. I I love... I love the crocodile

516
01:00:17,105 --> 01:00:21,660
that swallowed the latch jumping in the captain Hooks watch

517
01:00:22,879 --> 01:00:39,846
in in Peter pan, of course, that's an element from the story from a long time before. But... But it's a fun trope. You know, I like... I like this story device of being able to hear it. And it creates such a nice sense of dread. I just... It dove does feel like Al let down to me. Yeah.

518
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:58,192
I like Barks doesn't is really a good consistent running gag that ends up solving the solution like Scrooge memory pills and back to the plan is clogged in in gold clogged pores setting, mister ray like thermostats. Yeah. In that sense it is it is tightly

519
01:00:58,529 --> 01:00:59,029
constructed.

520
01:00:59,446 --> 01:01:06,345
Maybe a little too tightly constructed. Right? Because, like, this is Al a nineteen pager, it's pretty brisk.

521
01:01:06,805 --> 01:01:29,389
I feel like I feel like it could've have... It it might have benefited from a little bit more length, but there's not too much meat to this story. So maybe that would have been padding. Well Bo does Huey, get this magical number three. I think the porch brought up three times and the final time is big year, a big solution. Right. Yeah. So that's pretty cool. Let's see.

522
01:01:30,847 --> 01:01:38,744
As far as some reflect So, you know, you and I, I think I think we're in an agreement that this is, like fine I would agree with you. This is kind of an average

523
01:01:39,122 --> 01:01:39,441
Barks

524
01:01:40,015 --> 01:02:04,545
Scrooge adventure. And and the community would would pretty much agree with us. Right? This one this one has on index the site that we check in on to see how the community is ranked things. It's got a a score of seven point six which is good for a rank as of right now, rank one hundred and ninety nine out of all... Yeah. We're at about forty two thousand some rankings.

525
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:08,200
So you know, top two hundred, that's solid.

526
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:16,292
If you look at just the Barks stories, it's about the middle of the road for the Barks adventure story. So that's it's an average

527
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:25,330
story as far as community. Thanks. This one has... You know, you had alluded to the Don Rosa file that is

528
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:28,350
one of the cases, I think, Miguel,

529
01:02:28,671 --> 01:02:32,145
where the rows of follow is much

530
01:02:32,723 --> 01:02:37,446
stronger and the original Barks story. That might be maybe that's a hot take.

531
01:02:37,783 --> 01:02:39,717
I'm sure there are some Barks p

532
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,606
that would vehemently

533
01:02:42,023 --> 01:02:43,241
disagree with me. But

534
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:48,545
I think return to X do is among Don roses

535
01:02:49,002 --> 01:02:49,595
very bad

536
01:02:50,294 --> 01:02:50,794
stories.

537
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:52,672
Very great with you their markets...

538
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:55,348
It's different than Barks and

539
01:02:55,687 --> 01:02:59,717
probably more in is a more epic story that's what's working. And

540
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,273
I think it's Done Done rosa best

541
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:13,966
definitely his best earlier story. Yeah. And I don't know. I it... It's probably in my top, like, two to three. I also think of his manager team Ducktales is being pretty far up there.

542
01:03:14,383 --> 01:03:30,035
But it's it's a very strong story and to be clear, it is much more of a follow to trauma Al law than it is to this story, the lost crown of getting this gone. But he did something really special, I think with those two stories where he he combined these elements

543
01:03:30,531 --> 01:03:34,457
in these two Himalayas set stories. In a way that feels

544
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:43,523
really nasty control, has some really strong story telling. It does not feel at all. Like he just sm them together

545
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:48,367
just because they're both Hem himalayas out like it it feels like a very thoughtful

546
01:03:48,985 --> 01:03:52,801
way to to create this follow up to two stories

547
01:03:53,314 --> 01:03:58,080
you know, and he connects it to the to the classic c ridge poem about Za.

548
01:03:58,737 --> 01:04:20,026
Really really a great achievement of his eye. Yeah. I think it was really clever to combine them and make trouble Al lot to be not do. And Right. Also because the crown of Youngest khan is is a key element that's locked it on together is it's necessary to... Because the docs will never go back to travel willingly after after that's chester that's happened. Right?

549
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:26,710
Right. Exactly. Yeah. I I think it's one of Don roses kind singular achievements after the whole like life and times.

550
01:04:27,365 --> 01:04:41,160
Story. And and then I know that, you know, Bark is famous for his paintings things and lit the graphs. But I don't think he had one any any corresponding paintings. For this one as far as I know. No. It it would mostly be fans asking for

551
01:04:41,820 --> 01:05:04,202
and pictures. So I suppose no fan. One to the picture for this tour. Yeah. I don't I don't think goo. But, you know, the the obvious scene would be the the monster walking in. Right? And I don't think anyone would be too likely to want Al lavish whale painting of that goof ball. Will be fun just imagine this oil painting with the.

552
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:23,890
Yeah. Yeah. I can imagine it. And and so here's the fun element that I'm I'm kind of excited to mention. Miguel, did you... You're you're quite a bit younger than Al. So like, we're we're in we're in different generations. But as a child in nineteen eighty nine, I loved me some Disney comics.

553
01:05:24,424 --> 01:05:29,234
Which, you know, I'm proud that I I am proud that I discovered the comments

554
01:05:29,852 --> 01:05:37,360
before I discovered Ducktales just by a few months. But it was not the other way around, but I did. I love duck.

555
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:41,055
And and I loved my Nintendo entertainment system.

556
01:05:41,512 --> 01:05:46,917
So in nineteen eighty nine, we got a duck video game on the N nes made by Cap.

557
01:05:47,334 --> 01:05:54,200
Did you ever happen to plant? No and they we're really play that much with video games as as a child. It's more and later

558
01:05:54,500 --> 01:06:06,637
with friends so looking to with do games. But I didn't time it doesn't a trailer that was have more old school ringing. Nice. Well, so, I mean, it it would... It would have been a pretty dated system for you. But

559
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:17,760
a lot of those old Disney games, any video game wasn't really that connected, you know, when they're representing things in eight But anyway, one of the five levels of the Ducktales

560
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,057
nintendo game was the Himalayas and

561
01:06:21,396 --> 01:06:25,827
the the boss of the the video game level was.

562
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:30,302
Snow monster. It was not this one.

563
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:32,835
Because it looked more like classically

564
01:06:33,175 --> 01:06:38,895
for ferocious. But when when you defeat him, you do earn the treasure of the lost crown of getting this card.

565
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:48,575
So it's fun to have that direct Barks reference in in a classic video game. It's also got a fun eight bit sound soft probably

566
01:06:48,914 --> 01:06:50,972
probably stick a little bit of it right.

567
01:06:56,398 --> 01:06:59,131
Oh and and it was definitely the most annoying level

568
01:06:59,748 --> 01:07:00,248
because

569
01:07:00,745 --> 01:07:05,765
screwed with c skip on his thing but you couldn't sticking no because would just

570
01:07:08,978 --> 01:07:12,989
So so Mick, we we alluded to this, right? We mentions

571
01:07:13,328 --> 01:07:13,846
Ducktales

572
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,000
but

573
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,080
but this is one of a handful

574
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,440
of straightforward

575
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:19,540
Karl Barks

576
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,780
adaptations that the show did.

577
01:07:23,153 --> 01:07:30,017
And and they made some interesting choices for it. What what would you say is kind of the big change that they made in this one?

578
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:36,876
Definitely, the biggest french I made was to make a vulnerable snowman into the woman

579
01:07:37,214 --> 01:07:38,171
snow woman.

580
01:07:39,104 --> 01:07:42,971
Right I think it was a creative and much good decision for the cartoon.

581
01:07:43,928 --> 01:07:51,810
Sure. And and, you know, they use the webb character it kind of it kind of made for a a little relationship moment with her.

582
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:54,710
It's also notable that

583
01:07:55,344 --> 01:07:58,079
This is one of those, like adventure club

584
01:07:58,856 --> 01:08:00,952
episodes where Scrooge is actually

585
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:03,387
going on a competition

586
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:04,720
to

587
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:11,180
to find this treasure. You know? So that's that's how this one is pitched, and that's why he's doing this.

588
01:08:12,153 --> 01:08:18,595
The villa of that too. It kinda reminds me about Barks face building just that this one is

589
01:08:19,171 --> 01:08:21,307
dog face with star is

590
01:08:21,659 --> 01:08:24,075
friend of your classic humid Yeah. Toilet.

591
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:29,161
Yeah. Totally agree with you. He definitely could have been mixed wine or whatever.

592
01:08:29,694 --> 01:08:30,634
The pig face

593
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:41,774
name was that leak. I I went to. I thought it was a pretty good episode, you know? It was it was in early in the run. I think it was in the middle of their for season or so. And

594
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,343
I don't I certainly don't love the Ducktales

595
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,312
show the way that I did as a kid

596
01:08:50,024 --> 01:08:52,240
But but it's it's definitely...

597
01:08:52,898 --> 01:08:55,953
It's it's still a lot of fun. There's still Al lot of creativity.

598
01:08:56,571 --> 01:09:02,529
And and I thought that up was pretty good. Especially compared to some that I've revisited a recently.

599
01:09:03,207 --> 01:09:07,831
I'm thankful for the show that's because it did bring me into the Barks classics.

600
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:15,799
Yeah. I was four years old when I first watched doctor, and I quickly got the chronic Barks and I didn't really

601
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:34,249
continue watching doctor. I think we... We only had a few episodes going on the which television. But all of them were done. So there only a few of them. This one was the first I got to see. Yeah. So I I kinda feel like that that gave this... That makes this story Al little bit more extra

602
01:09:34,589 --> 01:09:36,666
extra famous just for being Inducks.

603
01:09:37,425 --> 01:09:38,604
Okay. And it's probably,

604
01:09:39,222 --> 01:09:44,460
you know, when I think about it, probably how a lot of American fans got into Barks

605
01:09:45,297 --> 01:09:47,846
because it came out in Gladstone.

606
01:09:49,058 --> 01:09:57,911
Publication of duck number one, the comic book that they had that mixed, like the Barks stories with adaptations of some of the episodes.

607
01:09:58,723 --> 01:10:07,331
So... Awesome. The that sudden. It had a quick little reference to the story with the helmet of henri discount. Just

608
01:10:07,988 --> 01:10:16,126
throw away reference really in the usual. Yeah. I I couldn't remember that. I didn't I didn't find anything. So I'm glad glad you mentioned that. That's gonna

609
01:10:16,465 --> 01:10:24,752
they didn't make it fairly similar to Barks the same. Right. Yeah. They tend to do that. They'll, like, make it look like it, and then they'll just Al.

610
01:10:26,232 --> 01:10:31,291
Yeah. In terms of the story elements, they'll straight from Let's see. I have three

611
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:33,172
there's ones that would look like Absolutely.

612
01:10:33,607 --> 01:10:37,386
Because in nineteen fifty seven, the year after the lost chrome got published,

613
01:10:37,726 --> 01:10:38,627
the oil magnets

614
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:41,386
thomas be slick from Texas

615
01:10:41,726 --> 01:10:50,312
organized the next expedition of find the get new week paper then published a picture from Barks comic to illustrate the story on the letter page.

616
01:10:51,006 --> 01:10:59,752
Bo probably kicked this out from the page paper and kept it. And that's me. It's neat little data I'll I will send you picture Barks so. Yeah. That's

617
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:12,117
Didn't I didn't catch that. Thank you for catching that. And it's funny that some people actually... There has been surprised the much critical of the story actually. Because two guys from Chile

618
01:11:12,457 --> 01:11:15,717
and named the ariel do North and Arm

619
01:11:16,217 --> 01:11:16,717
Metal,

620
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:22,075
I'm I'm sorry I mispronounced this, but they have a very strong political again that

621
01:11:22,452 --> 01:11:24,786
published in nineteen seventy one a book called

622
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:27,833
I'll download later how

623
01:11:28,171 --> 01:11:32,623
English with the title how to redo down deck with the secondary title in

624
01:11:33,839 --> 01:11:45,195
radiology in the disney comic. And they worked with the portal. They translated local printing and and no Who Barks himself was So there are, of course, right and the create of

625
01:11:45,653 --> 01:11:46,673
calling site

626
01:11:47,092 --> 01:11:49,269
colonization and robin all the cultures

627
01:11:49,648 --> 01:12:04,232
for their treasures. But the sentence of this book is afterwards I have read I I haven't read myself for with anger. And no worries that more clear done in the criticism of the assumed insults in the Los cr khan. Where David red Guru

628
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:06,289
snowman Barks

629
01:12:06,888 --> 01:12:08,427
interpretation of local mongolia

630
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,955
people at taught fool

631
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:25,050
behaves and talks like a child willingly offering the valuable crown for worthless Barks. And this is, of course, a little unfair criticism since I'm sure the box was... This wasn't his intention. I do not read you as a

632
01:12:25,388 --> 01:12:26,488
representation of locals

633
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,730
these Barks of create of the media there or just

634
01:12:31,068 --> 01:12:32,645
goofy snowman and the

635
01:12:33,102 --> 01:12:36,566
monster and also Barks strongly this live such.

636
01:12:37,585 --> 01:12:43,480
Well I think you have some clever Barks or thoughts on this because apparently, I said Al one point

637
01:12:43,859 --> 01:13:05,240
on the snowman preparing the when asked why does snowman preferred the cheap watch of the Golden Chrome Barks said It is a highly developed sense of what is important that prevents us all from the becoming y shall must say have some wonderful truth. Yeah. That's interesting. I'm I'm Gladstone highlighted that. I've been I've been curious about that book and I

638
01:13:05,578 --> 01:13:14,391
I remember encountering it years ago or at least a digital version of it, and I was curious about reading it. For for doing this podcast.

639
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:22,377
As you say, it's a little bit of a screen. I think the problem I think it's fair to criticize Barks.

640
01:13:22,871 --> 01:13:24,571
For some of his, like, very

641
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:25,371
colonial

642
01:13:25,951 --> 01:13:26,451
themes.

643
01:13:26,751 --> 01:13:52,378
I think you're right. Too that that grew is meant not grew. Goo that goo is meant to be he's not meant to be Huey, here. You know, he's definitely meant to be, like, a quote creature. I think. Probably something in between something in between man and eighth. And and to be clear, Barks wasn't afraid to like kind of poke fun hat and used stereotypes

644
01:13:52,756 --> 01:13:56,266
of indigenous people. Just when he did it, it was, like obvious.

645
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:57,320
You know?

646
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:02,672
And and Goo is not really. He's he's. I think he's just a goofy like Barks

647
01:14:03,311 --> 01:14:08,174
creation. So, yeah, that's an interesting point. That's something that chew over. Alright. So let's

648
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:11,343
let's go ahead and mention favorite panels.

649
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:15,628
Mikhail, do you have any any favorite panels that you'd like to highlight for this one? Yeah.

650
01:14:16,427 --> 01:14:27,959
I think there is actually many noise panels in this and the one I would like to highlight first is on the... Not on the last page for page eighteen. On the last panel, we have a Scrooge looking

651
01:14:28,615 --> 01:14:33,716
looking very clever and saying, no, as a man of magical powers, I have this abdominal

652
01:14:34,133 --> 01:14:43,345
boom hulk eating out of my hand. I think that's a it's a nice and then glad don't decided to use this is the the front cover for the

653
01:14:43,685 --> 01:15:13,879
publication, the Barks library and color. Yeah. You're right. That's a cool pose with him trying doing some magical fingers. I think for my part, I really like the panel where they just get that glimpse of the snowman wearing his his fur ominous, and they can't actually see him. It's it's the last, like, creepy part of the story, you know? And and it is very striking to me. I like that a lot. As you say though, there's a lot of nice ones. There's a lot of good

654
01:15:14,257 --> 01:15:23,855
reaction shots, you know, Scrooge looking sheep, donald being sarcastic. There's there's still a lot to like about this one. Even if it's not one of my favorites.

655
01:15:24,335 --> 01:15:25,455
No. Barks

656
01:15:25,575 --> 01:15:26,315
was still

657
01:15:26,671 --> 01:15:32,810
still on top of his game, the character the design, I would say, the Ducktales still it's still small. They don't got long legs

658
01:15:33,191 --> 01:15:34,830
and sure later gets.

659
01:15:35,446 --> 01:15:35,946
Right.

660
01:15:36,486 --> 01:15:36,986
Excellent.

661
01:15:37,486 --> 01:15:48,394
Alright. And any other any other thoughts before we wrap it up? Yeah. Just have one one quick little thing and mh. It's interesting that Barks wasn't the only artist that got inspired by the whole

662
01:15:49,172 --> 01:16:03,730
thing going on because the Belgian Cartridge interior would make his own story to that in nineteen fifty eight to fifty nine. The creative of team twenty zero along with cap heather to find them in search of ten lost friend, Shu

663
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:07,810
shen. So, yeah. It's cool that also boulder

664
01:16:08,725 --> 01:16:14,305
pretty much from the same time decided to send their heroes on a quest for to best. Absolutely.

665
01:16:14,645 --> 01:16:17,125
One of one of the other most famous comment.

666
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,400
Creations around that era.

667
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:24,255
Haven't read... Haven't read Tan myself I'm more of an asterisk fan. But.

668
01:16:25,192 --> 01:16:28,860
But I know a lot of people. Hello. Lu been. Excellent. Well,

669
01:16:29,737 --> 01:16:36,993
thank you very much for joining me Miguel. To go over this story. There's a lot of interesting stuff to talk about, I think.

670
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:43,074
And and people can always check your your fan art out if they'd like too. Right?

671

01:16:47,089 --> 01:16:49,666
on Facebook, but I believe you are

673
01:16:50,379 --> 01:16:50,899
say it again?

674
01:16:51,937 --> 01:16:57,071
Hog technique. Right. So it's it's your name, and then the word draws

675
01:16:57,504 --> 01:16:57,943
in

676
01:16:58,343 --> 01:17:09,291
Norwegian. Right? So it's m I k k e l h a g e n and then n an s, And then how you spell tech Ci again?

677
01:17:10,008 --> 01:17:10,527
Tech Ninja.

678
01:17:11,404 --> 01:17:15,292
Is t e g n e r. Yes. Excellent.

679
01:17:15,925 --> 01:17:19,185
