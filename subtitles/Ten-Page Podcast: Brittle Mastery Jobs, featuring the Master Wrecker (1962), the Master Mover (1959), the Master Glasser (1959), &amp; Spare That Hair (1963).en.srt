And we're back with another

6
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,256
Donald jobs themed

7
00:00:44,913 --> 00:00:48,008
episode. We're gonna talk about the brittle mastery

8
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:55,479
jobs this time, and I'll talk a little bit about what those are, but first, I wanted to

9
00:00:55,856 --> 00:01:08,666
introduce my guest host this time. I'm gonna mention their names and and just as I did for our previous jobs episode, I will ask them to mention their most Donald Duck Es.

10
00:01:09,522 --> 00:01:12,257
So we've got Al H

11
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:14,172
and Ruben Os,

12
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:17,474
Mi miguel, why don't you go first?

13
00:01:18,152 --> 00:01:24,786
Hello? My name is Michael H. I am a young man from Norway. We're growing up loving on the comments.

14
00:01:25,344 --> 00:01:27,281
The problem was done there

15
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:31,232
I Severino had was I was an extra movie sets for

16
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:32,884
series,

17
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:37,439
and then I was set to play jumper around like a gorilla and more

18
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:38,378
repeatedly.

19
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:39,917
From gag

20
00:01:40,336 --> 00:01:49,473
episode where we're me and a bunch of other kids have the messed up the the name of the school on the side. That's a good one. I can I can definitely

21
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,835
pitch sure that being being something donald would go through? How about you, Ruben? Yeah. Hey. I'm Ruben.

22
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,748
Twenty one year old, the norwegian.

23
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:00,005
Man boy.

24
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,439
I enjoys mail dot com of course. Group and

25
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:14,694
for works and jobs that I've done, I've come from a family of sawmill workers, so I believe parks could've have made a lot of times actions

26
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:19,165
is down that working and and dangerous situations, of course. Yeah.

27
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:22,421
I've also worked Al a pretty fancy

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,300
cafe

29
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:48,116
which I believe the loa would have screwed up pretty nice... Yeah. Definitely a lot of good comedic potential there. Well, thank you both for joining me Ruben, this is your your first time back. You join me for another of the B Mastery stories. We got to cover the master rain maker And Mi miguel, this is your your first time joining us, and I I really appreciate

30
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:51,598
both of you being on. I really like having that scanned

31
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,665
perspective. Right? You guys are both from Norway.

32
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:56,354
So you get to...

33
00:02:56,771 --> 00:03:00,760
Get to share a little bit about what it's like to be Norwegian fans.

34
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:02,697
So the Brittle Mass

35
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:04,985
stories. I'm I'm I'm using

36
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:05,943
the

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,416
the title of a collection

38
00:03:08,794 --> 00:03:21,647
that Gladstone did way back. In the late eighties, I think. There there's a collection of several of these stories and and it's a really great description of this very, like, Carl Barks

39
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:23,881
story type that he did

40
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:27,210
about a half a dozen or so times.

41
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:38,659
Right? They they're... They really stand out. They're very funny. And I I think they're one of the most, like Carl Barks things that he ever did. Basically, the deal is.

42
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:51,110
Donald has a job at the very beginning of the story. Right. We don't see him get the job. We we always just jump right into it, and he's really good at it. It's usually something

43
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,106
obscure

44
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,040
were a little bit weird.

45
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:04,610
And as the master would suggest, you know, master part of the title would suggest. He's very good at it. And we see him during the course of these stories, getting celebrated

46
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:05,968
by people

47
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:07,965
for for being a master

48
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:08,979
generally,

49
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:14,204
and then, of course, because he's Donald Inducks, something is gonna go disastrous

50
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:21,872
wrong. So that that... That's kind of it in a nutshell. Right? And and so in in this collection,

51
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,125
that I'm holding up,

52
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:31,574
Michele and Ruben, you can see it here. This one collects five of the stories And and they are as

53
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:49,333
again, mentioned, master rain maker is widely accepted I think is the best of these stories. We covered that one. That was a lot of fun. But I it's... I believe it's actually the first one isn't it using this for what? It is Yeah. That one was back in nineteen fifty three. You're right.

54
00:04:50,211 --> 00:05:02,128
Very highly rated. It usually... If you look it up on the index, it's it's roughly, like, top ten or just outside of the top ten of his, like, best rated ten pager.

55
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:03,802
And then we've got

56
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:13,759
our featured story today, the one that's gonna get kind of the the majority of our focus is the master record. I think the three of us here probably

57
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:22,537
agree that it is the the next best of them. What do you guys think? Are we in agreement that Rain maker is the best of them? Yeah.

58
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:31,627
But the master record is certainly completed the story I thing think about this the second right after the rain maker when I think about this zone mastery

59
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:34,834
stories. Yeah. The rain maker one is. Absolutely

60
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:42,237
superb to me when my Al time favorite ten pages of Barks, actually when my favorites stories of Al time of uploads. Yeah. It's awesome.

61
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:49,375
And the thing that rain maker and rec, I think have in common is that they both have like, this iconic

62
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:52,255
Donald has a relationship with his vehicle.

63
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:57,415
Right? He's he's Al. He he's got a crop dusting plain in the rain maker.

64
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:02,345
And he's got a wrecking ball and the wrapper. And so those just make for some really

65
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:03,224
iconic

66
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:03,963
images.

67
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:06,540
But we've also got

68
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:08,351
the master glass

69
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:14,230
was featured in this collection where he's gonna be a glass maker. We've got one called the mass

70
00:06:14,768 --> 00:06:17,501
remover or he's like a moving specialist.

71
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:24,215
And then this one, this collection also included the the only one that's not called master is

72
00:06:24,673 --> 00:06:29,162
spare that hair, which could've have been called the master Barber if

73
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,129
if they want it. I would argue

74
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:34,287
that maybe it doesn't fit perfectly

75
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:39,660
just because, like, he doesn't have to flee the country at the end.

76
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:51,136
But we can we can get into it after after we talk about what what does and doesn't kinda of fit that formula me. I believe I could mention that, I believe in the norwegian

77
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:56,625
grocery stores and stores at this point. There actually is a collection that's

78
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:02,132
collects all of these or of them. But a handful of these job stories and b

79
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:05,238
in original data editions, of course. That's awesome.

80
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:16,635
Looks like if finally in collection for children to read them get into these stories. Yeah. Because they're made in this small smaller size so it's easier to hold for kids. Nice.

81
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:42,941
Yeah. This is the second week in a row where on Barks remarks where we're talking about Donald jobs just because it's such a great, you know, it's it's so relatable that... John Donald had so many different jobs and Barks has mind a lot of humor over the years, out of Donald jobs. This is like it own special category that I I just I love these so much. I think they're... I think they're hilarious.

82
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:48,225
So you guys, let's do this. Let's launch in to

83
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:55,365
talking about the master record, which is again gonna be our our focused our main story here today.

84
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll open up with a little bit of detail about the story This one is

85
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:09,195
most of these are a little bit later than the ones that I've been getting to focus on, like the main adventure episodes.

86
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:19,651
Master record is dated September of nineteen sixty two and wasn't published until Al Disney Comments and stories two hundred and sixty

87
00:08:20,044 --> 00:08:23,781
four. It is the second highest rated out of all of these

88
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,940
mastery

89
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,218
stories. So,

90
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:39,902
I guess, to give us our kind of benchmark, mass or rain maker if you look at it on Inducks. That gets a seven point five rating, which is good for number two hundred and fifty out of all, like, forty one forty two thousand

91
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:47,585
stories rated on end up. So that that's really high. This one is pretty pretty high as well. It's a seven point four.

92
00:08:48,040 --> 00:09:00,188
Good for number four hundred and fifteen. I think I calculated at some point either seven point one or seven point two is like median for Barks stories. So that this is a well

93
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:02,145
regarded one. And

94
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:10,160
If you're a little kid reading this just the idea of donald with a wrecking ball, I think is is awesome.

95
00:09:10,654 --> 00:09:13,685
But this one has a really great opening.

96
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:17,616
It's it's it's very over the top. It's very

97
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:22,215
It's got a very silly tone because we see Donald

98
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:25,562
starting his morning routine. And

99
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:32,987
and and it has the narrator box in English it says books are written about the might of men who build houses.

100
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:39,188
But consider the night of those who wreck them. And and Donald is just

101
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:44,350
he is getting out of bed and he's in this like, strong man pose,

102
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:45,746
and every

103
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:46,623
element

104
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:57,413
in the... Every visual on the page is supposed to clue us in to the fact that he is a tough guy who is focused on

105
00:09:57,752 --> 00:09:58,252
wrecking

106
00:09:58,951 --> 00:09:59,451
buildings,

107
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:01,823
There are some wonderful

108
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:03,221
site gag

109
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,515
and and the nephews user as they often are in these stories are very supportive of him.

110
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:10,984
They're essentially his assistance.

111
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:15,530
And in this case, they're telling him about the order that's just come in

112
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:26,397
that says the school board wants him direct the old duck High school. They're getting him a stack of of pancakes a economically tall stack of pancakes

113
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:34,010
for him to get ready. And you guys there's just such a huge number of great site gag

114
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:36,462
on this page. Ruben,

115
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:42,496
are there any favorite site gag of yours that stand out? Oh, I will you at just

116
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:46,426
let's plan first flash panel there has so many like it's

117
00:10:46,805 --> 00:11:00,279
underneath it does not a matter thermostat It's playing phone hard blank, and underneath those planks, you can see odd rocks. So it's... That's it that petra is betty is just laying on planks and rocks. As well as

118
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,120
which is like an abrasive

119
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,654
cleaning thing that's very I know. And I just love... I love his breakfast

120
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:19,006
and I know just how we looks at this page and those also in the next page. Well, I've written them notes here. Human themed machine because the first panel is like

121
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:24,052
sn, like just the mechanical steam thingy. It's just is it's like iron

122
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:24,930
mechanical

123
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:55,494
big iron man. That even though it's just so small and a time man Huey, breaks through everything. It's just so mad and just love Al the bullshit. What... And you said it even though he's so small. Right? I think I think that's part of the comedy here. Donald Duck is kind of a shrimp in here. What do you think Make miguel, anything stand out to you on this page? Yeah. I really love the the titles of the books. And special panel. No really low Barks. Often have these little gadgets with book titles.

124
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:56,053
Yeah.

125
00:11:57,504 --> 00:12:00,044
What what are those titles in in your

126
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:09,479
translation? I'm curious about that. Well, the first book is called with the four of Troy. And the second one is the distraction of Cargo and the full of rome.

127
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:16,183
Right. So they're all these plays on cities that have fallen And of course, the fall of Rome is a real

128
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:21,247
scholar work, but but then they he continues it. And it's a little

129
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:28,058
what's the word... It's a liter in English because it's the crushing of cart and the top wing of Troy.

130
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:32,799
Oh, I I love the breakfast serial that they serve him.

131
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:38,501
It's it's got whole iron wood nuts fortified with zinc copper calcium, limestone

132
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:39,949
brass and ball bear.

133
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:41,426
He's just

134
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:48,242
sn the whole way. I don't know if it translates similarly and yours. Well, yeah, it's pretty much the same thing to make difference

135
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:53,174
it's marvelous. I love it. Yeah. Yeah. Because we we have a very new

136
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:59,409
translation from around two thousand and five look this basically a direct translation of the regional

137
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,029
Excellent.

138
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:02,269
And

139
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:11,444
every... This this is an incredibly strong opening the page. I love this one. Yeah. I just wanna make mention that in the

140
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:20,587
second last panel on this page, I love how the is, like, just pushing those pancakes down this throat. I believe it's is one, two, three, four,

141
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:27,934
six or seven pancakes. He had a look for. Just pushing down with those is throat, and it's chewing and jumping

142
00:13:28,394 --> 00:13:32,603
It's just a machine. He's not mechanical, man. Yeah. He is an Al

143
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:35,814
of tough in this one. Yeah. Also

144
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:40,552
I really like what you've been said about don't being such a small guy. Barks

145
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:48,136
is really good of showing the dx as small. Small people with the in this big world. Right. He gets a lot of comedy from that.

146
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:56,344
So very strong opener on the second page, you know, the Nephews are presenting him with his work

147
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,369
uniform, which is an iron hat and mailed god bless. And

148
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:04,557
just to emphasize his tough he kinda punches

149
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:06,965
the post of his mailbox

150
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:07,922
and

151
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:12,667
and breaks away some of that. And and we transition

152
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:16,554
to the the old cool house where

153
00:14:17,454 --> 00:14:21,714
people from the school board are presenting it. And Donald is

154
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:26,360
seated in his wrecking ball. And and Barks is gonna really

155
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:29,393
get a lot of mileage out of, like, ant

156
00:14:30,864 --> 00:14:49,461
this wrecking ball, it's very funny. There... He's like an extension of it in this story. And he's studying it. And we we kinda learn what makes him a special a master wreck is that he has this really deaf touch. Where he winds up with the wrecking ball and

157
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:51,553
slams it into this cool.

158
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:52,791
And

159
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:58,405
Michele tell us what happens with that with the the windows there. Every will loop also separately.

160
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:02,748
Into meat, little stable. Right. Yeah. It's awesome.

161
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:07,852
It's really typical goldberg Barks great humor. Just so Yeah. It's really showcase

162
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:16,735
background from from the story board department. Yeah. Really automated. Yeah. Yeah you get a great sense of motion with this.

163
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:29,372
And and so on to the next page, you know, he continues to give it this treatment. He continues to, like, he soften up the building with... As he says a pump pump here and a sump pump there.

164
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:30,991
And

165
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:38,515
ruben... What... How does he like finish off the racking of of this school house? Well, we talked about personal

166
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:40,587
personalization, the

167
00:15:41,003 --> 00:15:53,339
machine in the working goal. And after the bail building is just soft but looks like, almost looks like some jelly or just some... Yeah. It looks tough up. It it can't be described. Described And the neck on the next panel, the

168
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,019
rag ball working machine whatever whichever I wanna I call it, is standing on it sticker.

169
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:58,719
Yeah.

170
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,279
I just love that.

171
00:16:01,614 --> 00:16:18,684
Just to get little tap on the top of the chimney made. And of course, I I don't believe this I... I cannot not see how this work would work button and life even in this car too. But all the materials, everything that building is made enough is sorted out laid in files. It's just perfect. This is this

172
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:32,359
material can just read stacked into a trailer and marie reused anywhere else. That's right. Yeah. I... My wife is oracle text and she studies like green building. I have a feeling this would get the the lead

173
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:33,315
certification.

174
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:39,386
It as you said, it's a it's a real bit of cartoon logic. It's very funny. It's very imaginative.

175
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:41,595
And and at the end of the page,

176
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:50,560
Donald is taking about to an appreciative audience, and this is a a big theme that runs through these a lot. Right? He likes to play the proud.

177
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:51,214
Yeah.

178
00:16:52,453 --> 00:17:01,517
Boy. So that... That's that's our first one. Right? In in these stories, we generally get to see Donald have two really good

179
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:02,395
successes.

180
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:07,344
That's all Barks needs to show us to demonstrate. We know he's

181
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:10,674
already good at what he does. The next order

182
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:12,315
for his services

183
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:15,394
is to tear down the old

184
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:16,855
accordion factory.

185
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:23,156
Which is a steel building and donald notes that steel buildings

186
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:25,111
require special treatment

187
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:34,620
I really like how an English Barks kinda words this. It's it's not necessarily poetic, but it's very killing. He says most necessary

188
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:41,953
is some strong bracing at one end. And then Mikhail, do you wanna tell us what is the next most necessary

189
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:47,421
thing. Well, the only use is breaking ball machine to pick up some razors

190
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,616
before it then take the great

191
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:51,665
is it four ton heavy

192
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,415
iron ball and then mac

193
00:17:55,389 --> 00:18:00,925
factory to a great little c. Their melody and it all wraps together like

194
00:18:01,502 --> 00:18:02,201
a cord.

195
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:05,310
To the to a makes a little melody in

196
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:10,995
see notes. I love this visual so much you guys. This is so funny.

197
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:15,010
It's it's again very cartoon logic. It's totally ridiculous.

198
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:29,069
But it it cracks me up. Right. Absolutely more less. It's my favorite emissions of the and this story. And the fact that it is the accordion factory, and it's like this steel building that has like like factory

199
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:31,884
roof it's like p because that's angles

200
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:34,242
right. And repeated the

201
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:36,320
system almost, like

202
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:38,577
or something Yeah. Exactly.

203
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:39,716
When

204
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:47,151
pushes it together, It works just like Al recording it's it's like of course. Yeah. It's it's excellent.

205
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:51,274
And and so now we get the third

206
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:56,622
assignment. Right? This is the one where things generally go wrong. And

207
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:07,109
he... The nephews are commenting how his jobs keep getting bigger as famous spreading, and he is approached by the mayor. To clear the site for duck

208
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:09,904
news sea seaside Barks.

209
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:14,824
And on the way, Donald asks, are there many buildings on the site to be demolished?

210
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:20,054
And the mayor kind of sneak clearly says, no. Just just one or

211
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:25,164
structure. And that structure is old for Inducks.

212
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:29,264
And and we get this visual of this just massive

213
00:19:30,124 --> 00:19:30,924
stone for.

214
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:35,112
What do they call it in your guys? Just florida.

215
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,983
Okay. We old four Ducktales. Right? And domino's

216
00:19:39,321 --> 00:19:42,914
is is not a common word in English, but it just means

217
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:57,364
completely sturdy and tough. And again, it's it's just over the top how difficult this gonna be and donald has this great days pose like he's bitten off more than he can chew. Yeah. I just think Was should've have mentioned that it looks

218
00:19:58,023 --> 00:20:05,628
strangely few futuristic. It looks really modern. It looks like it like some for the building. Yeah. And I don't see why Barks would

219
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:10,792
make that choice. I think search buildings for more common than we I think.

220
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:17,433
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I read this as, like, I mean, growing eye up in

221
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:24,066
outside San Francisco, there was an old fork that my dad would take me to to visit sometimes that was like

222
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:26,716
just mass of, you know, concrete

223
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:27,632
structure,

224
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:39,925
kinda like this. But you're right. It almost looks like it belongs on the coast of the mediterranean or something to me. I don't know the style. Doesn't doesn't look very for dot burn. But it it needs to look utterly

225
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,856
massive and then... Yeah.

226
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:54,864
And absolutely looks like one big of something. Like, it's the same material and there's no screws and anything thing, it's like this is one big piece right. Right. It might as well be the rock of gibraltar.

227
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:56,698
So Donald gears

228
00:20:57,394 --> 00:21:04,745
smash into it with designer ball, the nephews user of serving, and they're like, well, it's gonna take more of a wall than that.

229
00:21:05,622 --> 00:21:19,184
And and so on to the next page, you know, Donald gives it a really good wind up. He says in English. I'll I'll give it the olympic ham hammer shoes, I think is how you pronounced that. I think it's like something to do with the hammer throat from the olympics.

230
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:30,629
And be comments that the wall is ten feet thick and asks them if he cracked it just a little bit, but no in fact, his four ton iron ball has

231
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:31,507
cr.

232
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:33,661
So he's gonna get

233
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:39,903
a ten ton ball and and we transitioned to him at it for hours

234
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,419
and hours.

235
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:45,784
And the nephews user are tired and they... They're noting that it

236
00:21:46,442 --> 00:21:57,624
it sounds like the iron ball is lost its ping. Maybe the fort softened up a little bit. And Donald asked them. How's it going? I... I'm so tired. I can't see to the end of the boom.

237
00:21:58,223 --> 00:21:58,863
You wanna...

238
00:21:59,262 --> 00:22:07,102
Miguel, do you wanna tell us how it's going for him? Yeah. No. Not going very well for a portal. It's for ton Iron ball. Al

239
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:10,375
oh, this is the ten ton iron board. Yeah.

240
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:28,089
Been down to this tiny tiny Al little marble. You're hanging there That's right. In in in the original, they they comment that it's it's worn down to the size of a p. It's absolutely with amazing. How it's worn down and it's not even a Scrooge in the

241
00:22:28,585 --> 00:22:32,307
for Right. Yeah. This this a really... Go ahead we miguel. Yeah.

242
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:41,324
No also just want to point out the great visual rule at the beginning of the page when mcdonald's wrecking machine winds up like a baseball player.

243
00:22:41,984 --> 00:22:43,764
Just gives us the subs.

244
00:22:44,184 --> 00:22:44,579
It's

245
00:22:45,396 --> 00:22:51,530
that's a good catch because that's one of my favorite panels. That's one of the one of the best that's a great great piece of work.

246
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:58,508
And and so, you know, we're on the next page, we're really concerned that Donald is gonna fail here

247
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:14,649
because he he hasn't managed to do anything. But he approaches and he listens for a week spots with his quote expert years, and we see him kinda home in on it, and he explains the nephews that his expert Barks.

248
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:23,823
Say that his pounding is loosened Al earth fault under the fort. So he directs them to bring me a p shooter and what's left of the ball.

249
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,060
And and we get this awesome

250
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:27,339
a ridiculous

251
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:34,426
sequence where he uses the p shooter to fire the ball at the floor, and the whole thing

252
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:40,434
slides off the cliff into the c and, again, you get some great applause. Thoughts

253
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:47,181
this is just great because Barks here makes us worry. The tone is gonna fail. And then you don't. It's

254
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:51,427
grow to even bigger proportions. And I just noticed

255
00:23:51,964 --> 00:24:09,385
just got covered on the Barks here, you see the second panel on this page and then look at his hands, that doesn't look very function to me digit... Or It may... Maybe they do, but it they look kinda too dimensional. I don't like to look like I hands from that. Yeah. You're right. That that that is not the best piece.

256
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:10,379
Of

257
00:24:10,878 --> 00:24:16,572
Barks are. That that that one looks like a little quickly dry And also the eyes aren't completely

258
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:18,030
point to at the same direction.

259
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:22,181
I wonder what happened here. Yeah. Well, he's got quite the face.

260
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,100
Honestly

261
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:35,202
so usually, the third one is where things go go wrong. But he keeps this one going on a little bit longer than usual, but it is gonna be the investigation for for his downfall.

262
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,254
So Donald is basking in the

263
00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:42,774
of Duck. He's he's even got a a parade

264
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:46,865
everyone Loves Donald it's a little bit over the top.

265
00:24:47,243 --> 00:24:47,942
The Nephews

266
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,734
comment, he's popular. He hasn't an enemy in the world. But we do see that Donald does

267
00:24:56,112 --> 00:25:15,804
have an enemy. It's a little nat, and the narrator box tells us that the Matt's home was destroyed when Donald south the floor into the sea. And Donald is given another assignment by the nephews while he's fend off and trying to swat at that nat. And he verbal

268
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:18,556
the address of his new assignment

269
00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:20,809
which is seven sixty

270
00:25:21,149 --> 00:25:21,649
eight

271
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:28,304
Plus avenue, and he arrives at the top brass club, a pretty fancy,

272
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:31,904
it was described as a s, but it... But it looks

273
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:38,506
very fancy. What are they call it in in your guys? They're simply naming it

274
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:42,893
feed the recruitment vest, which means yeah point the find

275
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:51,363
what's Yeah. The the pretty ones club located in on the west side. Right on Any thoughts? Call is using

276
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:52,599
reusing

277
00:25:53,295 --> 00:25:54,727
gag from no such.

278
00:25:56,182 --> 00:25:56,261
Yeah.

279
00:25:57,378 --> 00:26:04,474
Yeah. That's right. Because because this nat spoiler is is going to be his downfall. Right? It is...

280
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:10,394
It is gonna cause him to mix up the address, which as you mentioned is is what happens

281
00:26:10,774 --> 00:26:12,174
in no such environment.

282
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:19,229
He he he felt free to reuse all sorts of elements of his stories as hundreds of stories.

283
00:26:19,884 --> 00:26:22,464
And and we get this fun sequence next

284
00:26:22,844 --> 00:26:30,719
where he's giving the the quote shaq, his usual softening treatment and we see that the there are people

285
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,319
inside the club and we get some pretty comedic

286
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:36,339
moments of them dealing.

287
00:26:36,794 --> 00:27:06,809
Ruben, what's your... What what what do you like on the inside? Well, what we say is we see a update figure. I believe it's the mayor that by way, I love saying the big we had a dog earlier, but I love saying the big later. He's said a bathtub, and the wool behind them is starting and shrinking, and it doesn't like it. Of course, the auto on the shelves, the sculptures they're falling down, the sn are running to to save it, but I cannot they fall to to the ground break. And of course, I love the next one.

288
00:27:07,383 --> 00:27:12,385
Where there's just women man standing up from his cherry reading a book. And him is there, I

289
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:14,457
really looking news.

290
00:27:14,928 --> 00:27:24,012
It is. It is a pretty silly looking. Yeah love it. I love it. And and he's just... Well, what is Al this nonsense, I believe is saying something like that.

291
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:42,944
Oh the next panel. I Can't even Scrooge it. Take it... Oh, yeah. How it falls off the the wall and and thugs. It's it's a pretty funny sound effect in English this is food. Mh. And and so, you know, they're all freaked out. They they hide in the sellers thinking the martian are invading or something.

292
00:27:43,284 --> 00:27:47,444
And and so Donald delivers the the finishing blow, the K rock.

293
00:27:48,216 --> 00:27:53,019
And knocks it right off the foundation. And and on the next page,

294
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:53,856
he

295
00:27:54,392 --> 00:27:54,892
realizes

296
00:27:55,324 --> 00:28:01,037
his mistake, the the club members are glaring at him from the exposed seller.

297
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:07,233
He's asking himself to I make a mistake. This is seven six eight Plus Avenue. Isn't it?

298
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,202
And and that little nat giggles

299
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:18,518
as it flies away revealing that it was supposed to be one sixty eight Plus Avenue. It's it's a silly

300
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:20,155
plot device

301
00:28:20,748 --> 00:28:23,683
But it but it works, you know, Donald Hub

302
00:28:24,141 --> 00:28:24,641
is...

303
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:29,929
We've we've gotta see his downfall. Bark never likes to leave him.

304
00:28:30,423 --> 00:28:36,783
With this amount of glory. Mi miguel, do you wanna tell us how we how we wrap up the story? Yeah. As they say

305
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,056
in norwegian techs to say

306
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:42,146
whole moves start fall, like Hub

307
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:45,821
will make you fall. So we find down and you doing

308
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,319
don't have the so code.

309
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:48,553
Done

310
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:50,029
built

311
00:28:50,806 --> 00:28:55,456
igloo. And then use some I speak to shop down this.

312
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:57,705
For of penguins.

313
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:58,441
Yeah.

314
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:04,841
Right. So he's still getting pause, but it's from a bunch of of of penguins.

315
00:29:05,434 --> 00:29:23,143
It's it's a very silly closer. I don't know that the closing is is the strongest part of the story. But it but it works. It's it's cute. The the point is he's had to... He's had to flee the country, basically. That's that's how these often do. He ends up on the run.

316
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:32,166
And and that That is the master for rec gentlemen. Yeah. Any any any overall thoughts from you about our our featured story here.

317
00:29:32,665 --> 00:29:37,595
Ruben you go first? Yeah. Well, actually, I kinda disagree with you on the end because I thing is right.

318
00:29:38,953 --> 00:29:43,109
And I love how we can actually see donald in is new head.

319
00:29:43,602 --> 00:30:02,632
Because often, it's just like either on saying, Oh, no. He ran off to concrete or you just see packing its bag and running away from his trouble or anything. But harry, I actually see where they end up. And you see him miss happy here because can continuous profession that is still gets the attention and he needs. Yeah. That's.

320
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:40,342
I actually love that. It's great to see. That's a good point. You know, usually, he's like, freaked out, like like in no such environment. Right, when he was... It's interesting no such environment. It's an adventure story, but it kinda works almost as one of these. Right? Where he's he's just freaked out by the idea of what he was usual used to be a master of and he has to abandon it. But here he liked it enough that he he kept it up in this other form. But what do you think, Miguel, do you like the ending here? I think they're landing is really it's a real quick accounting. Goes the same recent said that don't don't get this

321
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:49,019
attention. And that's probably what was the most important frame. To to get some those. And it doesn't matter if it's thing penguins or

322
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:59,742
the dub knows people. Yeah. I I love this one. I think the The wrecking ball element of it is so fun the way he smash the buildings.

323
00:31:00,121 --> 00:31:10,302
As a kid, it really sparked my imagination I I imagine you guys had your own, like, phase as kids where when you loved construction vehicles of all kinds.

324
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:13,792
Right. To me, this one is like, just perfectly

325
00:31:14,368 --> 00:31:16,783
engineered to be a great, a great

326
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:22,384
ten page story to entertain kids. Yeah. I think it's a great introduction for young children.

327
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:23,979
Learn Al these stories

328
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:30,339
to introduce them to the coverage because yeah. It's kind of machinery and it's community. You guys

329
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:35,585
actually kinda exciting. Yeah. Make interaction introduction for

330
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:53,614
children ring dot com. Right. And and it's just the wildly over the top how he is just so tough and rough at the beginning. I I love this one. So I think I think this one is great. I dare say. I think it I it might be a little underrated to be honest Al to to be, like,

331
00:31:54,532 --> 00:31:57,746
the community calls this to four hundred and fifteen

332
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:07,079
That that's a well regarded story, but I don't know. I I love this one. I think this is awesome. So let's go ahead and transition next.

333
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:08,052
To...

334
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,387
Why don't we go kinda chronological

335
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:11,584
with the others?

336
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:14,057
I guess that means that master

337
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:14,794
move.

338
00:32:15,209 --> 00:32:19,569
Would be... Oh, I. I guess... Yeah. Because we'll hold smoke writer for later.

339
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:21,749
Master mover

340
00:32:22,184 --> 00:32:37,556
is the earliest apart from master Rain maker of these. So the master mover was released again in March of nineteen fifty nine. That one came out in Walt disney disease Wisconsin and stories two hundred and twenty two. It's pretty average

341
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:43,161
to low average rated for a Barks story. It gets a seven point one from the community

342
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,598
Inducks good for one thousand

343
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,715
four hundred and seventy

344
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:53,919
four. So I'm a little bit lower on but but been fun story. And

345
00:32:54,417 --> 00:33:01,853
I like master remover a lot, but it and also it's it's a kind of an odd story in some ways.

346
00:33:02,332 --> 00:33:17,504
So what we're gonna do is I'm not gonna go through this one blow by blow. I I'd like to just offer a bit of a summary of this one, and then I invite you guys to tell me some of the elements that you thought you really enjoyed

347
00:33:17,924 --> 00:33:23,244
from this one and what made it notable. But we we know our a formula. In this one,

348
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:26,515
Donald is... Has totally mastered

349
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:32,171
the business of moving people. And we see sort of the typical

350
00:33:32,484 --> 00:33:35,424
set up where he gets a couple of challenges.

351
00:33:36,244 --> 00:33:39,264
He has to move. He has to move a father's

352
00:33:39,738 --> 00:33:40,836
teenage daughter

353
00:33:41,254 --> 00:33:43,550
at first is his first challenge.

354
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:47,439
It's a little bit it's a little bit sexist. I'm not gonna lie.

355
00:33:48,254 --> 00:33:49,674
It's it's mostly harmless,

356
00:33:50,174 --> 00:33:50,674
but

357
00:33:51,374 --> 00:33:56,274
but but it's fun... It's a funny little bit. He's gonna end up moving some jewels

358
00:33:56,588 --> 00:33:59,766
from a jewel store has kind of the second,

359
00:34:00,145 --> 00:34:00,304
you know,

360
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:01,923
challenge

361
00:34:03,181 --> 00:34:06,652
that'll that'll be a fun way where he asked to get past to them.

362
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:21,362
And it it sets it up really quick. Right? And and then Barks is almost less interested in the moving aspect of it, then where he's gonna end up because his final job, the one that's gonna test him

363
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:38,820
is that he has to move he has a really quote easy moving job basically moving some zoo animals for this natural as who wants to essentially re hone them into the wild. And and the real crux of this story is this ridiculous

364
00:34:39,316 --> 00:34:40,971
minor bird who

365
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:48,264
is basically gonna bully donald into letting him go and convincing Donald

366
00:34:48,578 --> 00:34:51,313
that he can help him with great advice

367
00:34:51,971 --> 00:34:57,461
for moving the rest of these dumb animals in exchange for prune.

368
00:34:58,452 --> 00:35:01,640
Is it p in in your version guys?

369
00:35:03,075 --> 00:35:11,779
Barks clearly finds prune very committed. Doesn't he. Because this is, you know, the beagle boys classic favorite that that one beagle.

370
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:18,314
But but, you know, he's warned not to let this burned out and not to let him get prune

371
00:35:18,894 --> 00:35:27,078
because they make him over overcome and they make him think he's tough. And and essentially, the min is gonna use his minor language

372
00:35:27,694 --> 00:35:34,392
to mess with the other animals and and force donald to have to let him out in change for the prune

373
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,125
that for some reason, he happens to have.

374
00:35:37,923 --> 00:35:41,715
And it says miracle commitments. You don't drive around with P not carl all time?

375
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:51,719
I mean, who who... Who doesn't? Oh, maybe just gonna make him thing. Right. Right. And he's gonna end up, you know, it takes place on this, like,

376
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:53,153
canyon

377
00:35:53,572 --> 00:36:10,030
out at this in this remote location. So he's gonna end up calling these these bald eagles at the end to fight Donald. And that's how he gets the prune and and he he's gonna end up thinking that he's super tough. And there's gonna be some, you know, comedic mishap with these eagles

378
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:13,235
and the mine is gonna get his, like, come up.

379
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:15,367
And and at the end,

380
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:19,176
donald does not have to, like, flee the country.

381
00:36:19,648 --> 00:36:27,082
Right? Things don't go horribly wrong in front of a big crowd. But he does get completely scared out of the moving business.

382
00:36:28,033 --> 00:36:37,769
And and has to, like, resort to to con last and building up his strength by eating proof. So that's basically this story in a nutshell.

383
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:49,237
Who wants to go to bat for this one? What do you... What do you guys think? Do you... How do you feel about this story? Well, I would like to start. I just want to mention that when I read this yesterday, I made some notes and

384
00:36:49,656 --> 00:37:01,599
about halfway went through the story. I noted Is this a moving story, But the the section with the animals, I see that he's supposed to move them, but it just doesn't seem like one of those middle stories to me. It's just double

385
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:15,960
versus the animals. And it just doesn't feel like a mas history in that sense that it doesn't it doesn't move that much. When I see a, I believe like, moving sort insurance stuff like that. And of course, it's funny and

386
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:20,043
moves animals this time. Just doesn't feel like one of those

387
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,034
jobs numbers stupid. Yeah. I kinda debated

388
00:37:24,129 --> 00:37:27,580
on the second part, I will say on the first part, very much so

389
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:28,914
mazda america Al job.

390
00:37:29,528 --> 00:37:42,824
Right, because because it starts out those first two, it it fall... It follows the formula pretty well, but it really stretches out the one where things go. Go horribly wrong. What do you think the Al? Yeah. The story

391
00:37:43,484 --> 00:37:45,064
so start Al a

392
00:37:45,404 --> 00:37:46,144
very typical

393
00:37:46,604 --> 00:37:52,774
mazda history, but then it's it really shifts into this a lot of issue Huey,

394
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:59,724
animals. And then we also get we get some nice kind of cr bird. Certainly bark most

395
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:00,644
entrepreneur

396
00:38:01,064 --> 00:38:01,564
animal,

397
00:38:02,304 --> 00:38:04,144
except for for actual heroes.

398
00:38:04,757 --> 00:38:08,143
Yeah. I I think you're right. This mina is a real wise guy.

399
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:10,237
And and is definitely

400
00:38:10,574 --> 00:38:15,830
supposed to be Al animal. Right? Like, it's got it's got human type cognition,

401
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:39,259
but we're definitely supposed to read it as an animal. So the the Minor really ticks me off. He's very abrasive. Right? He's he's a jerk. Yeah and I I guess I didn't really mention the fact that like, the suspense of the story is that Donald has to move these animals across this very rick bridge. I I like that element to the story. That seems

402
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,379
that seems pretty cool. Absolutely. It's it's simple.

403
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:44,299
It's

404
00:38:44,839 --> 00:39:13,989
perfectly cliche, but it's It's simple, and he just needs to move like, this animals from point eight pound point b, and you can see both phones have bought be on the side of the of the bridge. So it's a very a simple idea, it's a simple. It's not something you have to rep head around. I like I like how his this job kicks off. Right? He's like, let's see what species you have in here. And he opens the van and just immediately gets chased across by.

405
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:16,449
Got a lot. That is kind fun.

406
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:18,989
I just wanna mention that

407
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:32,892
because I did actually make some notes about the opening... Transfer for the first mission, he has to move his t teenage daughter At first, I thought why because she's lying on the carpet on my floor. Just talking on the phone. And I thought like, this is really dated.

408
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,805
T teenager is just talking on their phone, but then I was like, oh,

409
00:39:36,683 --> 00:39:38,120
are on their phone Al time still.

410
00:39:39,052 --> 00:39:39,552
Right.

411
00:39:40,049 --> 00:40:00,338
I I've I've been a the major in the digital era and I set my phone and just snapchat all the time. So it's kinda like this timeless was idea that Right. That the teenagers that need to talk to their friends of the time and they... I catch. Think you can't get away from your bones. Really liked that idea actually. Yeah. I'm also

412
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:07,616
grown up during this digital age being twenty five. And I really would like to seen my Barks with

413
00:40:08,355 --> 00:40:09,414
made out of

414
00:40:09,793 --> 00:40:10,293
today's

415
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,370
teenagers or basically

416
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:22,953
glued the phone screens. Yeah. He would've have... I'm sure he would have had a lot to say about the rise of of phone culture. I think the only real difference

417
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,747
today is that a lot of kids

418
00:40:25,203 --> 00:40:26,837
hate to talk on the phone,

419
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:29,682
They they prefer tech Right?

420
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:39,216
It's... I guess it's not as as daunting if it's your friend. But, like, I know my I have a teenager my steps son. Is is eighteen,

421
00:40:39,792 --> 00:41:08,114
and he can he can video chat or he can text but he will not audio chat. And and I think a lot of teens are like that. I it it's pretty funny how he gets her away with this like really long loop of x wire. It's it's cute. And I I do like... I like how he gets the jewels, the diamonds past the the Robert. They're planning that. That was very clever. I noted that because that's straight,

422
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:09,834
I don't know. It's.

423
00:41:10,948 --> 00:41:18,040
Right. Right. There there's a situation where you can almost picture that being a sub supply and a a story with uncle Scrooge. Right? He poses

424
00:41:18,474 --> 00:41:19,894
as just like a

425
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:42,479
a jan and hides it in a harmless looking coil of hose to to take it out. I like... I like that the that the Zoo keeper just kinda like drives them there says, alright. Yeah I got I gotta go now. You you guys can handle it. He. All these warnings about the Min bird. My friend is a little cruel that is just gonna leave this

426
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:54,182
one doctor because it... The wings of this bird is clipped. I know. All... These random animals that he's just gonna let loose. He his this seems like a bit of a

427
00:41:54,521 --> 00:42:00,594
path to me. It is pretty funny when the miner gets, like all full of prune.

428
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:08,273
Right. And he's this total, like, Huey, seems like that that little guy in the bar who's had a few drinks, you know? Yeah. Right.

429
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:17,544
Just the same thing. About prune being, like an middle alcohol on this. Yeah. Awesome. Alright. So so there's the master

430
00:42:17,924 --> 00:42:18,424
mover

431
00:42:18,764 --> 00:42:21,719
next up in terms of chronic chronology.

432
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:34,685
Alright. And and next up in the chronology would be the master Gladstone. This came out just couple of months after the master mover in November of nineteen fifty nine. This was in Donald Duck number sixty

433
00:42:35,104 --> 00:42:40,483
six. And it's not a very highly regarded one. It's got that kinda low average

434
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,494
score of seven point one.

435
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:44,124
And it's a

436
00:42:44,463 --> 00:42:51,739
number one thousand eight hundred and seventy six. It's also a pretty short story. Is it is it anything

437
00:42:52,235 --> 00:43:01,052
nature. Yeah Yeah. Yeah. This is a five page. What do you guys think? Do you think he could've have... I wonder if this was, like, intended to be a ten pager

438
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:16,166
and he just didn't feel like it had the material. I I didn't remember that until I really did a dive into these. Was like, oh, yeah, this one's not even a ten pager but it definitely fits this mold because he's got this very weird job

439
00:43:16,783 --> 00:43:23,973
I mean, repairing glass, that's a a very important thing, but it's not definitely not a common job. And he's really cra

440
00:43:24,874 --> 00:43:25,374
problems

441
00:43:26,394 --> 00:43:29,068
that that are like worthy of his talents.

442
00:43:29,929 --> 00:43:34,389
He doesn't like the idea just fixing broken windows from kids

443
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:36,149
playing with ball,

444
00:43:36,942 --> 00:43:38,520
balls, like, his nephew.

445
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:48,519
We get almost as quickly as the master mover. We get a couple of his, like, little success where he repairs

446
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:54,279
a fish bowl for some some ladies fish who's named her goldfish Poops.

447
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:58,930
And then and then a a fancy, like automobile

448
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:03,126
ent has his eighteen ninety nine

449
00:44:03,465 --> 00:44:05,378
light bulb has been

450
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,973
smashed by a near site Wood packer.

451
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:16,064
And and it's it's very cute, but again, it's very quick. And ultimately,

452
00:44:16,524 --> 00:44:17,624
he's hoping

453
00:44:17,964 --> 00:44:18,984
for, like this

454
00:44:19,364 --> 00:44:19,864
opportunity

455
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:26,879
and he gets it. When the new Tv tower needs the giant clock

456
00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:30,559
faced. And he offers to do it for free

457
00:44:30,873 --> 00:44:33,165
if the Tv people will

458
00:44:33,582 --> 00:44:34,259
broadcast it.

459
00:44:35,056 --> 00:44:37,826
And we get this this pretty cheesy sequence

460
00:44:38,417 --> 00:44:41,509
where he's like, really ham it up for the cameras,

461
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:46,990
showing off the powered tuning for that he uses for these tasks.

462
00:44:47,723 --> 00:44:55,624
And as he aims it to get rid of the like, smashed glass, the Tvs end up broadcasting it. To all of Ducktales.

463
00:44:56,676 --> 00:45:00,223
And they... He he... He ends up shattering every bit of glass in town.

464
00:45:00,741 --> 00:45:10,864
And he doesn't get the chance to flee at the end of this one because he's been corner up that top the top of that clock tower by pretty much everyone in town.

465
00:45:11,517 --> 00:45:20,613
It's got a funny silly little ending where you said he's in the spot, like just like he wanted. So that... That's a pretty quick summary of the master asked.

466
00:45:21,193 --> 00:45:22,373
Why don't we start nico

467
00:45:22,673 --> 00:45:25,613
what do you think about this? What works for this one what doesn't...

468
00:45:25,913 --> 00:45:27,494
Well I think so

469
00:45:28,048 --> 00:45:30,468
is there very short but well structured?

470
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:31,828
And

471
00:45:32,449 --> 00:45:35,203
dom Huey, is where more in

472
00:45:35,582 --> 00:45:38,434
it's more focus here because this more adult savers

473
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:39,590
this

474
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:41,822
makes and fall. Compared to the others

475
00:45:42,717 --> 00:45:47,448
yeah. More barely. Because the auto one see just it's mostly bad actually.

476
00:45:47,848 --> 00:45:51,428
It's just my standings and bad luck. And this one. He actually

477
00:45:52,063 --> 00:45:53,661
because it wants that famous so hard.

478
00:45:54,340 --> 00:46:03,242
This is what that makes makes it come Barks him. Yeah. And and I I think we don't sympathize with him as much in as one because he is so desperate for it. Right?

479
00:46:04,577 --> 00:46:07,550
It it's it's fun. It's got its cute little elements

480
00:46:07,984 --> 00:46:10,044
I I really like the sequence

481
00:46:10,624 --> 00:46:11,124
with

482
00:46:11,544 --> 00:46:16,024
the the two lead up sequences where he fixes his poop he's fish ball,

483
00:46:16,518 --> 00:46:18,177
and the the gentleman,

484
00:46:18,995 --> 00:46:31,177
those little quick characters are good example of Barks creating some fun little one off. The the the automobile ent. You look at him and, he's in one of those autos that's old

485
00:46:31,636 --> 00:46:35,345
even at this time and the sixth steve's. This is like a a

486
00:46:35,803 --> 00:46:44,140
sixty year old auto. And and he's just just funny. But the this one... It's it's fine. It's not a story that I would

487
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:49,908
seek out if it wasn't kind of included with these other ones, I think. I also like this

488
00:46:50,406 --> 00:47:15,499
background yikes box we use two times with Al black seal silhouette of Tom's car and all the little tools that is for now. Yeah. That's true The springs and hammers are just pulling out of car showing out what thing he's going. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good catch. That is that is a nice little Element, and I do really like that. Yeah. This this is a fun story. I I I... I'm glad I'm glad we got a few of these brutal master stories.

489
00:47:16,073 --> 00:47:27,565
Yeah. I think I think this one is, like, it's not that great eyes though but, like, with follow Barks little jobs stories, I think it's I add to the collection. I think it's fun. It's like it's cute. And

490
00:47:28,263 --> 00:47:30,002
I actually really like the...

491
00:47:30,341 --> 00:47:41,078
And I really like that part at the end where he's in the spotlight. And of course, as everyone wants to chase him at top for this pad at the top of this tower, there's actually three spotlight like

492
00:47:41,774 --> 00:47:46,660
him in the night. I thought that was really funny. I really picked me. Yeah. And we do get a a neat

493
00:47:47,037 --> 00:47:56,335
callback at the end as everyone's glass through a town starts to break, you know, one house we see there goes our windows and our rare god

494
00:47:56,848 --> 00:48:04,864
and poops these goldfish fish bowls that lady has a little little return there. Oh oh, yeah. That's great. Cute. Small is

495
00:48:05,284 --> 00:48:08,644
takes and four more. Just not that Remember. Yeah.

496
00:48:09,404 --> 00:48:11,184
No. It's more of a support to

497
00:48:11,658 --> 00:48:36,411
story that I I don't know it was if it was placed first in the in this and store first appearance. But Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised. I didn't check, but I I'm... I imagine it probably wasn't the lead off story. It's also rare that we cover stories that were in not not in uncle Scrooge or Al business comments and stories, but a donald duck issue. Yeah. So right, guys. So

498
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:41,064
the the last story that was included in the original b mastery

499
00:48:41,564 --> 00:48:50,006
is called spare that hair and it's, you know, not it's not quote the master Barks, Like I like, it feels like it should be.

500
00:48:50,684 --> 00:48:59,024
But that's fine. There that hair was in Wall Disney Comments and troy two seventy two in May of nineteen sixty

501
00:48:59,524 --> 00:49:00,024
three.

502
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:02,704
So I I think that might be the latest

503
00:49:03,499 --> 00:49:06,376
story that I've really talked about on the podcast.

504
00:49:07,215 --> 00:49:16,075
It gets a seven point two from the community, number eight hundred and twenty nine. Store at least in the top thousand on index. It's a good solid

505
00:49:16,692 --> 00:49:17,192
later

506
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:23,550
Barks story, I think. And and we had talked about, like, does this one really fit the mold

507
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:26,303
because unlike the other brittle mastery

508
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,114
stories

509
00:49:27,493 --> 00:49:31,465
basically, the premise of this one is that Donald is an extraordinarily

510
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:32,783
good barber,

511
00:49:33,161 --> 00:49:33,661
and

512
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:37,429
can do really cool things. With people's hair.

513
00:49:38,369 --> 00:49:43,709
And and at the end, at the end of this one, there's gonna be an escape to gorilla.

514
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:48,987
That comes to his barber shop that he states for a real customer

515
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:51,755
and he gives them kind of his barber treatments.

516
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,859
And and the ring master that he is previously helped

517
00:49:56,236 --> 00:50:01,580
is gonna get upset at him for messing up the gorillas threatening looks.

518
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:08,734
But Donald is gonna like win out. Right? He's gonna threaten to cut off the ring master's Fancy pistachio.

519
00:50:09,328 --> 00:50:11,423
Unless he pays him for the grill his haircut.

520
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,853
And Donald just ends up enjoying the circus,

521
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:18,660
watching the harmless looking gorilla. At the end of this one.

522
00:50:19,713 --> 00:50:22,408
So I don't know. It it it definitely

523
00:50:22,747 --> 00:50:28,575
juice a little bit, but I guess when they did this collection, they they felt like they needed one more story.

524
00:50:29,149 --> 00:50:36,845
I personally think that maybe they should have picked either the smoke right story or the beauty business story

525
00:50:37,224 --> 00:50:40,525
might have fit the mold a little bit better. But

526
00:50:40,944 --> 00:50:49,045
this is a fun one. What did you guys think? I we really like all this wish little gas at the beginning of the story. We're don't having this

527
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:52,116
sites. What's the name of it again? It's...

528
00:50:52,573 --> 00:50:54,023
Oh, it's sai. Yeah. Right? Yeah.

529
00:50:55,099 --> 00:51:02,310
The the hair gigs and this one are a lot of fun. Yeah. And they are typical of the the master story because don't listen a master on it those

530
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:05,426
showcase is mastery and very

531
00:51:06,005 --> 00:51:06,245
Huey,

532
00:51:07,004 --> 00:51:14,621
visual ways. Yeah. It's a fun one. But what's your favorite of the rubin, what what which of the, you know, different haircut sequences

533
00:51:14,998 --> 00:51:23,354
do you like? Well you gonna love the ridiculous square Yeah. The first pull it's just... It's not ridiculous listen it's some Barks. Definitely.

534
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:38,510
I like that one. Yeah. We get he builds an egg head for someone he gives someone a screw cut instead of a group cut It's it's all very fun. It's very light. I don't think any of it is nearly as engaging as, like, the rain maker concept

535
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:39,670
or the wrecking

536
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:40,510
concept.

537
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:48,865
That he just hit such a home run with those two. I really like the screw cut though because in progress I saw a guy with that haircut was.

538
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,744
You really have that haircut. And yeah. That was.

539
00:51:53,440 --> 00:52:02,275
Nice. I I always felt like it was a little bit over the top cartoon logic that Donald doesn't realize that

540
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:10,615
is an an escape girl gorilla rather than just like a a tough a tough looking guy from the circus.

541
00:52:11,149 --> 00:52:14,140
So that that always can even annoyed me. Yeah. I can see that.

542
00:52:14,977 --> 00:52:18,468
It's a stroke in classic animation and a classic comic Barks. So

543
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:22,968
right. I will see if I can go with it. Yeah. Gorillas are always escaping.

544
00:52:23,566 --> 00:52:23,646
Yeah.

545
00:52:24,484 --> 00:52:31,757
Especially in the jorge. Yeah. Any any other thoughts for spare that here, anything else that's stood out to you guys? Well, you know,

546
00:52:32,675 --> 00:52:42,615
for fifty sixteen hundred years old every three years ago, they meant that com books with dangerous interest. I don't see how this story helps with donald the drug down with the coming but

547
00:52:43,275 --> 00:52:43,875
That's right.

548
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:47,075
That's right. He uses. What does he call it? Like,

549
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:49,067
powder of am

550
00:52:49,803 --> 00:52:54,648
or something. It's it's just called dreaming power norwegian. Oh, it's it's

551
00:52:55,105 --> 00:53:02,595
fortified papers of you. For. Yeah. Know what we're supposed to take that. They are right. He's totally, like dragging

552
00:53:03,012 --> 00:53:19,205
dragging this little sixties kid. I I find some of this one a little bit off putting, to be honest. It's not it's not my favorite story, but but is a little bit stronger, I would agree than like, the master glass or I think I might like the master

553
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:23,020
better than this one even though the community

554
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,900
ranks this one a little bit higher. Well, from what I can see, it looks like... And I actually

555
00:53:30,613 --> 00:53:36,755
like the first part where it just shows up so many in different ways come and fun ways that he like. This is Barks.

556
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:43,740
And of course, like rely on is well kinda odd but it's like yeah. I I.

557
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:59,982
Yeah. I only the first half. I think it's really Scrooge the first time. I agree I I remember this story. I think that's... I think that's the right take on it. So really strong beginning, and I... It's the ending that I find a little bit off putting. So it it feels like maybe he had it

558
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:05,844
and then he couldn't quite get that ending that would have kept him like, one of the true Brittle mastery

559
00:54:06,341 --> 00:54:09,664
stories. Yeah, the beauty business is a really late one.

560
00:54:10,301 --> 00:54:14,326
And it's technically I think a Donald and Daisy story. That mean.

561
00:54:15,058 --> 00:54:20,080
Yeah. I... And I don't have that one in front of me. So we we can talk about it, but I'm going from memory.

562
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:22,652
The beauty business

563
00:54:23,124 --> 00:54:23,624
is

564
00:54:23,962 --> 00:54:29,651
a nineteen sixty six one from Walt disney comics, and stories three zero nine.

565
00:54:30,388 --> 00:54:31,606
Seven point one

566
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,460
rang

567
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,840
today, you know, all these or what it shows on end index right now.

568
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,994
One thousand two hundred and eighty five. So not a very highly regarded one. I...

569
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:53,370
The the the beauty business one, it it kinda rep me. Just just the ending with the the the Crown. It's it's pretty test.

570
00:54:53,848 --> 00:54:58,732
It's some... It's an intriguing story telling. I'm sure that one has its fans. But

571
00:54:59,084 --> 00:55:01,059
That might be one of my least favorite

572
00:55:01,675 --> 00:55:02,534
well known

573
00:55:03,111 --> 00:55:07,597
ten pager. The whole thing old Chrome is, maybe again, your

574
00:55:08,149 --> 00:55:20,661
or Al Id that call used from the competition around nineteen forty forty six, I think. There was a competition in Us about drawing this the world's ugliest woman.

575
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:25,996
Or didn't win, but he did the participants in the there's fascinating.

576
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:29,010
A little disturbing, but but interesting.

577
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:42,365
Yeah. That one's more... It's more of a daisy story. So I guess, like, it's it's hard to even call it a Brittle mass for story but it's definitely got some of those elements where he's like really good Al what he does.

578
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:56,649
That's that's april May and June and it's too. I don't think I've ever talked about them in the podcast Daisy nieces. So that's kinda fun. Yeah. And I just remember that I keep mixing up spare hair and the beauty business because it's like all

579
00:55:57,224 --> 00:55:58,123
in a barber,

580
00:55:58,978 --> 00:55:59,478
edition

581
00:56:00,588 --> 00:56:01,088
right.

582
00:56:01,947 --> 00:56:05,563
Yeah. He's he's behind the a chair, you know, We're exactly

583
00:56:05,902 --> 00:56:07,380
he's working on people heads.

584
00:56:08,954 --> 00:56:10,375
What can I say? It's

585
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,895
there's similar in that way and also the opening, I find really

586
00:56:14,595 --> 00:56:32,388
based spaces that people's looks and that's where I keep mixing them up. And also I think that maybe I don't have the front meter here right here on right now, but I take you Barks elements information right there. And I also loved... I think it's a great ip idea yeah. The daisy is like... Because I remember right, what they system

587
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:34,760
last one in the story to be

588
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:38,073
master with but right. Yeah. For.

589
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:44,032
And it just keeps, like messing up or luke messing up or looks messing up or looks. And that makes it.

590
00:56:44,529 --> 00:56:48,736
Like... Well, and it's it's her niece is they're kind sabotage. Yeah

591
00:56:49,113 --> 00:56:50,730
Yeah. And let me

592
00:56:51,147 --> 00:56:54,740
mention them. Because I like I kinda like that concept. And

593
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:04,235
disturbing to look Al that I like idea. Yeah. It's fun. There's some weird ideas in that one. Some weird attitudes from, like Daisy is is very like.

594
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:07,875
Concerned with a shame.

595
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:15,490
Right. It's interesting that Donald is usually anxious about his mass validity. And these stories and and that one he's like, totally

596
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,470
totally down to be a mutation, which is kinda neat.

597
00:57:19,204 --> 00:57:21,641
And then Daisy gets all the anxiety about, you know,

598
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:27,590
I guess some of this nervous miss about, you know, spending time around other women.

599
00:57:28,728 --> 00:57:38,990
I think that one could definitely be kind of close to one of the mastery stories. The only other one that we haven't really talked about is the smoke writing

600
00:57:39,768 --> 00:57:53,560
one, which is a really fun one. I I Don't have that one in front of me, so I'm not like, even gonna offer up a big huge summary of that, but but what do you guys think? Does that one fit the bill? I think it fits the mold except long since wheel. Yeah.

601
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:55,538
It's just very

602
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:56,417
good

603
00:57:56,756 --> 00:57:58,709
Good Al it. Right? He's capable.

604
00:57:59,245 --> 00:58:01,579
He's making all these, like, sky

605
00:58:02,993 --> 00:58:08,295
images. Right? And then Uncle Scrooge hires him to promote him in his campaign

606
00:58:08,835 --> 00:58:16,589
for a mayor or something like that. Yeah. The I remember right? That's and things definitely go horribly wrong as he,

607
00:58:17,088 --> 00:58:19,786
you know, fills duck with awful

608
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:28,207
smoke. I just gonna mention it's a nineteen fifty six, November story, and while Disney comics, and stories one ninety four.

609
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:34,376
Community likes it pretty well. It got a seven point two good for nine fifty five. So

610
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:40,232
Go ahead. What what other thoughts did you have on that one? Well, I just want to say that read case, actually,

611
00:58:41,189 --> 00:58:41,689
and

612
00:58:42,505 --> 00:58:44,162
it starts out with them just

613
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:56,995
right with smoke using Al airplane in the sky. You gotta drawer the only right sweep, the splash panel. That's where Thing. So he Barks out we're making just a hard for firm for Daisy.

614
00:58:59,033 --> 00:59:01,550
And when he wants to do the thing for Al Scrooge,

615
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,065
set that out

616
00:59:03,725 --> 00:59:05,705
writing. That's all. I'm gonna

617
00:59:06,205 --> 00:59:08,545
draw your facing this sky. And of course,

618
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:09,425
clouds

619
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:14,800
crashing to his smoke rotting, making it look like a monkey or a short.

620
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,340
Severino

621
00:59:18,034 --> 00:59:24,278
and a snake and a donkey even. So the audience listening to Scrooge about his

622
00:59:25,548 --> 00:59:27,524
speech. Yeah. Imagine is

623
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,516
I not with them at all

624
00:59:30,973 --> 00:59:33,285
because they don't like this smoke right. I think it's

625
00:59:33,785 --> 00:59:35,725
provisioning the city. So

626
00:59:36,065 --> 00:59:41,705
when I see he head getting into all this, like, oh, he's a short. He's a don't oh. I think it's funny.

627
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:45,616
Love it. It doesn't really fit the formula in that way it doesn't really

628
00:59:45,955 --> 01:00:01,960
show his profession in the store. It just like I'm doing it. Oh this the screwed. And then he's, like that the first time. Yeah. That's true. It doesn't... Doesn't quite fit the bill. It does have some really great visual gaps. I like. Absolutely.

629
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:06,495
And I remember vividly it's... I haven't read in ages but I remember that

630
01:00:07,035 --> 01:00:16,858
Scrooge is campaigning, he's asked about air pollution, and and he says I'm for. Buster, I think. I'm not not knowing what it is. And

631
01:00:17,475 --> 01:00:20,567
Barks was really interested in, like, ecology

632
01:00:20,904 --> 01:00:26,602
and and pollution. And and that's something you got really interested in and is later

633
01:00:27,178 --> 01:00:30,109
career. So that that was kinda cool to see. So

634
01:00:31,059 --> 01:00:32,676
Yeah. There's there's arguably,

635
01:00:33,094 --> 01:00:37,384
like, really only four of these stories that, like, perfectly

636
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:51,350
fit the Al. But... But it's a pretty good run. There's definitely a handful of them that mostly or partially were. And again, like, it's an adventure your story, but no such environment is is kind of in that same vein too.

637
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:54,330
I I don't know if you guys

638
01:00:55,005 --> 01:00:59,825
Recall it, you probably do. But Don Rosa did a really awesome r

639
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:03,960
on on this. He did the master Al landscape

640
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:08,560
or landscape is. I can't remember that title. Yeah. The master landscape

641
01:01:09,673 --> 01:01:12,167
is like a pitch perfect

642
01:01:12,864 --> 01:01:13,223
take.

643
01:01:13,701 --> 01:01:14,201
But

644
01:01:14,618 --> 01:01:19,559
Rosa clearly knew. He clearly was like, yes, This is Barks formula,

645
01:01:19,897 --> 01:01:41,593
I wanna give this a try and tell this type of story because he was doing the exact thing and What what what are your thoughts on that one ruben? Well, I just wanna say a little quick fun fact because I just quickly flick through it in my Al of fame Barks earlier today. And that is actually the first story on rosa did for Ag. How nice?

646
01:01:42,192 --> 01:01:43,651
And I believe nineteen.

647
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:46,303
Three maybe... I two. I

648
01:01:47,081 --> 01:01:48,000
that. Maybe.

649
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:51,595
I like that's right. Right. It's a great take. And also,

650
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:53,590
There also many on

651
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:59,230
taking this formula and made other stories with it. I know Yeah That's I

652
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:05,838
ask you guys, can you think of any other artist who have who have done this specific like brittle mastery

653
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:08,316
thing? I I also

654
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:18,535
I love the master landscape campus. I think, you know, Rosa, I don't know if he... Is quite as comfortable doing the ten pager. I feel like sometimes he didn't him because he felt like

655
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:21,527
He needed to also do ten pages,

656
01:02:22,143 --> 01:02:30,331
but it wasn't like, what are he preferred to do. But that one is just about as good as it gets, I think. So so... Yeah, other other artists?

657
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:42,803
And I know that I didn't need to and in the norwegian production. Tms has Al least made one. This master stories. I don't remember it that clearly right now with the long is making

658
01:02:43,498 --> 01:03:00,755
cheap setting think. Because, yeah, I believe they and a region production team actually Have made a handful of these stories or at least they proved done Al lot of jobs. But in the same way as if with box Barks stories, I don't recall if they fit the brick master mode or if it's just done

659
01:03:01,428 --> 01:03:05,834
any mold because I know it's like a cake delivering man. Yeah

660
01:03:06,171 --> 01:03:08,902
and the something like. And it also also

661
01:03:09,934 --> 01:03:29,759
where his great ricardo player if that okay? Yeah Yeah. Yeah. You like a big pile of stores and have to pull one out without making the whole pile collapse. And so it's a up... Right. That called, that might be called pickup sticks in the states. Yeah. Okay. Because he's a great pickup stakes Ricardo blair Nice.

662
01:03:30,317 --> 01:03:33,769
And then he uses the ability when

663
01:03:34,107 --> 01:03:36,178
loosening up like when with

664
01:03:36,915 --> 01:03:37,415
largest

665
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:38,294
timber

666
01:03:38,871 --> 01:03:40,010
same maria timber

667
01:03:40,947 --> 01:03:41,447
have

668
01:03:41,785 --> 01:03:45,651
been stuck in the river. So they look like a big pile of And then it stopped and I just

669
01:03:46,746 --> 01:04:12,655
crashed to server and make this big part. And then download knows exactly which one it has to pull to make you Al the again. Nice. That that does sound like a a good. That sounds like an interesting one I should check out. And I believe it's a food review in one That may be the to potato chip one. And also the the one with the cake delivery which was written by Nylon I believe. I think that one is one move fits the mouse their formula the best

670
01:04:12,992 --> 01:04:14,028
in the region stories.

671
01:04:14,507 --> 01:04:25,151
Nice. Well, you guys are giving me some good suggestions for those. I have to have look those that so sound like fun. Yeah They probably don't pick exist English, I believe. Some of them, do work least, but

672
01:04:25,888 --> 01:04:35,255
sadly not too many of them. I the search versus Scrooge at least translate. Yeah. Okay. And I can't think of any specific ones. But I know that

673
01:04:35,993 --> 01:04:41,320
Van Horn has done enough like of the job stories where he must have done something

674
01:04:41,698 --> 01:04:51,330
along those lines. Right a William Van Warren. He. He's he's done a ton of job one. So I'll have to think about that. But you guys... I I think this was a really cool discussion.

675
01:04:52,463 --> 01:04:59,688
Yeah. I like this. I like this format man. I really appreciate. We had a few technical issues at the beginning of this episode, but we stuck it out.

676
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:03,320
You guys any closing thoughts

677
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:06,420
about these Brittle mastery stories? Yeah.

678
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:09,655
Before we wrap it up you guys any any

679
01:05:09,995 --> 01:05:13,315
panels that you'd like to call out in any of the stories?

680
01:05:14,315 --> 01:05:16,495
I'm love to call out the one we're down

681
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:23,870
last time on the first page of the master record, we're done is chewing down the pant the pancakes

682
01:05:24,344 --> 01:05:26,279
Yeah. With this me

683
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:34,709
with this vehicle phase. I actually think that the master record is one of those stories where the the opening pages is so

684
01:05:35,046 --> 01:05:47,361
strong that almost every panel is is just wonderful. Definitely, that first one stands out. And then you had mentioned I one you mentioned where the, I think ruben where it's on Tip toes

685
01:05:47,938 --> 01:05:48,997
his his

686
01:05:49,469 --> 01:05:51,803
wrecking ball, that's a great one.

687
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:58,262
And then the wind up as well. Just just to one And one of it's actually Covid regulatory.

688
01:05:58,695 --> 01:06:02,715
Yeah you three four times like that exact post and it's great I level the

689
01:06:03,295 --> 01:06:03,795
personalization

690
01:06:04,495 --> 01:06:05,555
drawings of the

691
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:07,255
ball writing machine. Right.

692
01:06:09,149 --> 01:06:12,326
Yeah. Any others from the master director? Oh, really.

693
01:06:12,905 --> 01:06:13,664
It was red rerun.

694
01:06:14,863 --> 01:06:17,580
What The thing I found Oh yeah. You were Inducks.

695
01:06:18,595 --> 01:06:21,395
The this story was completely red with Jose.

696
01:06:22,235 --> 01:06:28,787
I didn't know fun. The the the Brazilian... Well, the popular in Brazil. Characters Z C.

697
01:06:29,604 --> 01:06:31,321
They they really love him there.

698
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:40,813
Yeah. Any any panels that stand out in the master mover? To you guys? I I think for me, the stand out panels tends to be the

699
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:42,408
the minor bird

700
01:06:43,623 --> 01:06:45,736
being a big blow hard, you know,

701
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:57,985
trying to, like, talk as way out of the cage winding up. I think most of those are the best ones And I really like the the payoff of that bird on the last page, the second panel.

702
01:06:58,545 --> 01:07:04,178
Yeah. Where where the eagle is just squeezing that bird giving him for the the face of that

703
01:07:04,756 --> 01:07:12,281
at bit of that panel bell, I love it. Right. Yeah. That's a good one. Oh Miguel. Well every every time with Al little bird is

704
01:07:12,793 --> 01:07:16,800
It's just a great to come itself Really like it's

705
01:07:17,536 --> 01:07:18,514
self secure

706
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:20,268
policies and

707
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,320
this page where which I believe is

708
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:24,640
page eight

709
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:30,415
where standing on the first panel. Thing towing the nephews that they can all the

710
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:33,115
languages of all animals around the world.

711
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:35,015
Right. Yeah. That

712
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:41,265
Al least real lunch alone and that And and then for glass, you know, you guys called out. One of you mentioned

713
01:07:41,803 --> 01:07:44,115
the... I think Mi Al, you mentioned those

714
01:07:44,734 --> 01:07:49,603
running gag of the tools falling out of the silhouette that that is a really nice touch.

715
01:07:50,681 --> 01:07:54,110
And I just like the look of I had mentioned I like to look the automobile

716
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:55,270
ent see.

717
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:57,830
Yeah. He's great. And

718
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,850
you see how it's just like Al

719
01:08:00,464 --> 01:08:06,746
if I feel I'm a bit of a collector myself and I love building lego and stuff like that. And the

720
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:12,390
the phrase where it's just growing up loud that this eighty and ninety and nine my bulbs are

721
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:16,350
replaceable. It's just like seeing a a great collector

722
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:17,470
like

723
01:08:18,025 --> 01:08:19,045
some of this collection.

724
01:08:19,465 --> 01:08:20,125
And then

725
01:08:20,905 --> 01:08:34,011
we can wrap it up with spare that hair. Any favorites from that one? I think we'd already kinda called out that the that the that the square is pretty fun. Right? I like that one. Absolutely. I also like

726
01:08:35,042 --> 01:08:38,652
We just call up the splash panel where is this is so we all over

727
