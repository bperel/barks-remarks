00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:40,070
Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever a grown man who enjoys talking about stuck comics.

4
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:52,753
And I am joined by another grown man today, a new guest host that I'm very excited to have So I'm gonna let him introduce himself. Hi. My name is Y kim Y.

5
00:00:53,212 --> 00:01:00,784
I work as an editor. At Eggplant in Sweden, and most work with local brands of economics like ban and

6
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:04,293
That most of you never heard of, but

7
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,111
I also edit a comic book called Ka Sc. That's roughly da Ducktales classics

8
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:27,312
six times a year, we try to fill it with obscure and fun, great classic dune stories, and we also have one classic Barks store and every issue. So that... That's very exciting. What a what a treat, it must be to get to work with local es

9
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:29,070
the Barks stories

10
00:01:29,544 --> 00:01:50,830
I... I'm just so excited to get to meet people who are involved with the creation and the curation of these comments you joaquin. So So thank you very much for joining me. Thank you also for... You know, you you run the Carl Barks, I think you're one of the moderator of the Carl Barks group on Facebook and you've been very patient with my

11
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:57,879
my promoting the podcast. So I'm very grateful for that. But I'm having so much fun with this this

12
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:58,719
series

13
00:01:59,059 --> 00:01:59,559
and

14
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:07,094
we agreed that a good story for you to join me for would be what we hear in the states. It's

15
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:09,774
titled the think box ball.

16
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:11,414
What is it called

17
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:19,304
over there in E mont land. And and why are you excited about this one? Well, it's called the pro

18
00:02:19,762 --> 00:02:20,622
when it was

19
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:22,360
published in the seventies,

20
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:32,322
back in the fifties it tell, of course, no title. Right? But in the seventies, it was called roughly. Wonderful language would boxes, which has since been changed into

21
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:49,553
wonderful think boxes, which makes more sense. Yeah. I think so. It's interesting how these, like, titles will kind of evolve until they get, like, cod. You know, If you look this one up, I guess, in English, it was at some point it was called the Brain wolf.

22
00:02:50,231 --> 00:03:28,951
I am excited to talk about this one, but I but I'd love to know a little bit more about how you came to be into Carl Barks. You know, have you've been a Carl Barks fan for a long time, Y? Oh, since it was a small kid. I mean, this is the story of my wife, loving called Barks comics, my father bought all the comics from the late fifties Mid fifty up until nineteen sixty nine. Is save them whole so our grandparents have them stacked in their attic and then in the closet sets, and don't there. Just heaven for for kid like me reading them over and over and over again. Then of course, I I did not know about call, but I noticed

23
00:03:29,264 --> 00:04:06,720
those stories, the best uncle Scrooge adventures they were drawn a certain way. So yeah let's it discovered it the Barks stores. Yeah. That sounds really familiar. Right? Like, I remember being a kid and enjoying the Disney comics that were coming out in the mid and late eighties of that time and and it took me a little while to kind of figure out that there there were a couple of artists that just stood out, you know, they had a certain style I loved a lot of the comics by other ones, but they're there was really something about the Barks stories where they they felt like the the right version of the characters.

24
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:46,869
And the Old got, the More of the other stuff was not that interesting and more, but the Barks store still work and could still read them and reread them. Not the case, which with so many of the other stores. Yeah. I I think that's a good point. Right? These do have, like that timeless feel And when I've been going back now because it it's been probably a decades since I red. Most of them like you as a kid. I I read them over and over some of them, you know, maybe a hundred times literally, and and then I had a pretty long break where I wasn't reading them, and I'm I'm really finding that going back and reading them is a has a grown man now, I'm finding a lot of new things to appreciate.

25
00:04:47,169 --> 00:05:04,137
So so it's a lot of fun. I think you mentioned that you've got some kind of a project coming up that's related to a certain mister Ji Gear. Is that right? Could be could be? Because I've been think Al lot about this story in particular, lately and

26
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:05,894
how the relationship

27
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:15,304
between Donald, the nephews and ji evolves through these first stories about Barks. And I think we will get into that more after. We talk about the story.

28
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:22,809
Yeah. So I sense that your your decided to get into the the meat of the story itself. Let's cover a little bit of the background.

29
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,669
The the think box alex,

30
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:27,062
was released

31
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:28,456
in nineteen

32
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:29,413
fifty

33
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:41,591
two. It's got a cover date of June for for the American public communication in walt Disney comics and stories number one hundred and forty one. This is of course, one of his ten pager

34
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:54,603
So I don't research these ten page podcast episodes as much but you know, this is a pretty significant one so so I had to do a bit reese church. Right? We are dealing here with Ji Girl

35
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:02,854
first full length appearance, but he was a background care her in... What what was the original story joaquin?

36
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:09,589
The previous issue, actually, he came onto the scene hopping around for an hour on august he

37
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:18,060
is trying to turn better. But it's better. Yeah. It it's so interesting how, you know, Barks will sometimes turn these incidental characters

38
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:31,490
into someone who will like be the star of dozens of stories. Yes. One of the if you for first name a guy in a published. They had no clue news. Barks is no clue, but you remember him and tries

39
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:35,876
to open and next month. He's Barks. That's right. So a very

40
00:06:36,293 --> 00:06:37,324
a very modest

41
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:42,593
beginning there. Oh, I do like to mention how how often stories have been

42
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,506
reprinted. So this one has had

43
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:52,421
you know, a pretty good number of reprint in the Us I I count on index that there at least eleven. Counting

44
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:58,342
the main one. And, you know, that's not surprise. And since it's such a important character

45
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:01,578
introduction. And it didn't take long for to reach Sweden

46
00:07:01,997 --> 00:07:14,694
in early nineteen fifty three. So only eight months. Yeah. And that's not too common. Right? Sometimes there's a pretty big delay. Yes. Yes. Sometimes you you wait ten or twenty twenty years. Or so but this one came first. Excellent.

47
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:18,203
Alright. So y kim I am going to

48
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:23,925
go into the story itself. And then, you know, as something strikes us is interesting or notable,

49
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:31,319
We're gonna go ahead and talk about it. Sounds fine. So this one starts out from from Donald

50
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:35,846
perspective of. And the reader is drawn in with this really

51
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:48,080
loud sound the Donald is listening to, and he He's wondering what's going on. He here's some explosions from over fence. And so he runs to see what it is. And when he rounds the corner,

52
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:59,299
key and the reader, see Ji Gear we're about to learn who it is. Rolling down the street in this really unusual vehicle that he's gonna call a buggy

53
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:05,259
and Donald, Donald identifies him as being ji Gear the quote dizzy

54
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:19,951
invent her And Donald Wonders what this crazy buggy is, and he asks Ji about it, and he he tells him that it's his jet powered baggage buggy, and he tells them that it runs two blocks on a quart of fire crackers.

55
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:24,424
And and so at the end of the page, he loads it up and cautions

56
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:39,398
anyone in range to to get out of the way. So that's our introduction. Yes. A what a great introduction page because Barks also master this. You know how it says it's giant Girls the dis vendor. He explains to the readers

57
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:55,220
exactly who they see because they no clue and the nephew says hi Donald as if the reader is don't know who donald doc but every story someone's first stories of course, they need to know who that doll doc is. That's a good point that's like an editors

58
00:08:55,934 --> 00:09:08,428
point of view. Right? That... What what he's doing in the introduction. Al as a long time reader, I'm not noticing on that little, like, catch up that a good creator is doing at the beginning of every

59
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:16,589
for you're right. It's incredibly important and he does it at the same time that he really gets you interested because we see donald

60
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:20,605
and and he kind of keeps it out of sight for just a couple.

61
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:32,234
You know, I I just recorded an episode about the tear of the beagle boys where he'd stretched it out much longer, but It was the same thing. He was all about the

62
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:38,567
anticipation of always to come. So with the first page would know who all the characters are and

63
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:44,019
this serves has a set up for the setup of the story. Yeah. Some great shorthand setup.

64
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:55,306
And then on the second page, you know, we see the vehicle take off, and it's just an incredible bit of character art because The vehicle le forward.

65
00:09:55,763 --> 00:10:01,630
It's... Knocks donald off his feet. Gyro looks just ecstatic Al how it's working.

66
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:10,237
And Donald has this kind of surprising reaction, I think. Right? Where he, he's like delighted at looking at how

67
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:11,609
strange

68
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:14,849
gyro is at at this point, the

69
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:21,704
characterization is not really... It's not settled at all. And I love how in this setup, John

70
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:24,679
really, really mean. This law in the general

71
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:26,036
behaving

72
00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:37,375
but Barks has to do this. He does because this is the... This is the story that he wants to tell. Right? Like, he wants he wants gyro

73
00:10:37,873 --> 00:10:38,232
to, like,

74
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,850
overcome

75
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:41,646
that... This mock

76
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:49,003
this division, but it's technically a donald Inducks story. So he needs to be the avatar for...

77
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:49,580
Yes.

78
00:10:50,874 --> 00:10:59,414
I love the bit where where gyro just like stops the vehicle by crashing it into a tree and ten

79
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:03,300
and he's totally... He's totally nonchalant Al lot about it.

80
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:19,428
Because that's how he wanted to stop. Yeah. Of course. Do you so... It doesn't bother you then how mean Donald is in this one. No. Because it's part of the setup. So that he will get what he just deserves like wrong. And the readers will...

81
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:23,254
How how do you say it? They will feel that it's.

82
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,002
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

83
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:32,858
Because because of the way it don't behaves in the beginning. And and this is again, me as an editor. I think about these things all the time.

84
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:46,644
Sometimes I might think too much about this stuff. I love to hear. I I love to hear this, Y joaquin. This is this is great to me. Hearing the editorial process is is so interesting. So I appreciate you telling me

85
00:11:47,024 --> 00:12:19,781
because I know as a kid reading this one. I I loved this one I think this one stands out for a good reason. But I do remember thinking like, why is Donald so mean in this one? And and, yeah, you know, sometimes Barks just needs him to do this. Because because that's what it means when you have that like, every man character. And so at the end of this page, you know, we we learned that really, this story is not even about this crazy contraption this this buggy. He's just used it to take himself to to test the other invention.

86
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:21,711
That he has now perfect

87
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,942
with which are his think boxes.

88
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,389
And show the readers what kind of work inventor

89
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:53,540
and is such a visual way to do it by showing this this driving around thing. Right. And and we immediately get two examples. Right? So we know he's not like a one off. Me know, he really is inventor. He has more than one. Onto to the next page, you know, the the characters are transitioning into the woods as we're getting the explanation for what the think Barks

90
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,134
are. And

91
00:12:55,595 --> 00:13:12,361
I really like the explanation. Would did do you wanna tell us about what the think boxes are supposed to do you joaquin? Well, the ray bean learned the animals how to think when they pass these two boxes. And here's the thing of course animals do think why shouldn't they.

92
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,279
But but then the nephews

93
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:22,195
explains the animals will be able to talk and do things like human beings, and now it gets interesting. The nephews,

94
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:48,941
they see themselves not Al Ducktales, but it's human beings. Isn't that room? Yeah. This is one of those times where, like, I guess he never he doesn't usually talk about it overt. But, of course, Carl Barks always thinks of his characters as human. Yes. He doesn't usually talk about it. No. But that's a key point. To realize what made Barks so good. He always fault about miss humans. Right? A not cute little docs

95
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:49,678
exactly.

96
00:13:50,277 --> 00:13:58,349
They're they're being Inducks is just it's incidental. And so we've got this very nice quick setup up. You know, they they are leaving the think boxes

97
00:13:58,664 --> 00:14:05,956
on an animal trail, and they're gonna check back tomorrow and see what the results are and Donald

98
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:06,969
is

99
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:11,569
he's kind of had time to digest what's going on and and

100
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:23,655
he's still getting a kick out of it, but then he's He's realized that his nephews are mixed up with Gi and so he is dig, and he's like why are you involved with this crack

101
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:30,122
and the nephews are very proud to to be able to count themselves as his assistance.

102
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:34,188
Yes. Sir. I think this was to be bugs original plan

103
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:48,032
and that it was going to stick to it, that they were going to be his assistance. Pairing the nephews with gyroscope to lead situations and stuff. But as we will see, this didn't work very. That's true. Yeah. He's got

104
00:14:48,504 --> 00:15:01,965
guess he's just got too many different scenarios for the docks. But but we transitioned to the Ducktales house and the next page, the the entirety of that page is basically about donald her rang his nephews that...

105
00:15:02,622 --> 00:15:16,799
They're gonna bring shame to the name of Duck by being involved with a crack. And then If do a really nice job of standing up for for ji and pointing out that, you know, people called the great inventors of their time like Edison.

106
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,319
Crack as well. And

107
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:23,614
this is the conflict page of the story. Donald is calling

108
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:25,234
screw ball Barks,

109
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:34,549
Wacky brains, I mean it's just inserting all the time here. Any and is install the nephews. That's right. He's he's insulting them by extension.

110
00:15:34,969 --> 00:15:37,609
Those terms are pretty fun, you know, Barks

111
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:42,879
English terms. Right? Crack, Scrooge, I imagine that it's hard

112
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:48,980
sometimes to localize terms like that. Yeah. I wish I have the switch this coming right here

113
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:55,949
the came I'm always interested when when people translate, you know, whether they decide to do, like, a literal

114
00:15:56,249 --> 00:16:05,222
translation or if they which I think is much better if they try to get something that's really within the the character of what's being said. Yeah. That's the tradition

115
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:15,074
we have here kevin Sweden. Just to make it as good as possible, not to stick to every sentence making just exactly as the English version. But

116
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:18,510
to make as good as possible and fun as possible. And I just

117
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:25,519
this also something else that's struck me. I'm gonna re reread it. But is referring to edison

118
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:30,379
Al only, which today's kids know who they were. I bet they did in fifties,

119
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:35,534
You're you're totally right. Right? Like, during this time, they would have been shorthand

120
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:37,374
for a great inventor.

121
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:44,845
And I think maybe Edison would still be known that people would probably go to like Tesla these days.

122
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,742
Right, Addison rival. And Marco,

123
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:50,514
of course, famously invented the telegraph.

124
00:16:50,853 --> 00:17:02,106
Right? The wireless typically Yeah. Yeah. The wireless telegraph. So so, yeah, not not as relevant. But still important, but, yeah, it's inter... It's it's fascinating the the re the references

125
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:03,661
that resonated

126
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:09,778
back in in the men early fifties. Yeah. So this page closes out with Donald

127
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:28,779
getting an idea. And and this is a great trope. Y kim where Donald wants to teach the Nephews lesson and and he gets some kind of wicked idea to send them up. And the second does we know how this is going to. Badly for Donald. Absolutely. It's so reliable.

128
00:17:29,355 --> 00:17:30,733
So and he's of desperate

129
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,120
about this that he goes straight to week's must coast in store.

130
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:43,269
And on the door. We got them there. I want to read now to it, and of course, the store owner is living in a store because

131
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:48,875
that works for the story. It's wool costume. And now with that in hand, the plot thickens.

132
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,948
Yeah. Indeed. So

133
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:56,160
just as he's set up. Right? We we return to that trail, Jay and the kids.

134
00:17:56,694 --> 00:18:02,401
The next morning, and and they're very happy to see a number of sets of traps,

135
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:05,235
including a set of wolf tracks.

136
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:06,349
And

137
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:08,879
immediately on the next panel,

138
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:15,282
we see a by pedal wolf that we the reader know to be donald in a wolf class

139
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:17,888
introducing himself with really

140
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:18,765
formal

141
00:18:19,102 --> 00:18:20,040
airy language,

142
00:18:20,855 --> 00:18:50,345
yes. That gentleman, that was me. Good morning a couple of couple of musical notes meant to den denote that he's being very airy about it. And they're they're stunned by what they see. Yeah. And and we, of course, get the little trope where we we the reader can see the buttons in the wolf class team, but of course, the the other Inducks can't. And also nice touch that in the final panel, ji even seems to price... That it works it says my invention works Yeah. Absolutely.

143
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:56,785
He he maybe was not confident. Yeah. Because latest stories, he mentioned anything and he

144
00:18:57,165 --> 00:19:04,903
mentioned those fabulous things, but here, he's might just starting out. That's right. Yeah. He calls himself inventor of anything.

145
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:05,715
So

146
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:10,265
On the next page, we get Donald trying to

147
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:19,224
fulfill his, like, devious plan. Right? He's explaining what happened that he was a dun wolfe walking through he passed through the boxes

148
00:19:19,802 --> 00:19:22,954
until he started acting like a human being and Donald

149
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:32,937
transitions into, like, acting creep beer and creep beer until he, he tells them that he no longer Al likes raw food, key wanted cooked food,

150
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:35,491
specifically roast Ducktales

151
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,200
and Y kim, I was really struck as a small child.

152
00:19:40,974 --> 00:20:04,475
Like, one of the reasons this one stands out to me and my memory is how scary. Parts of this story look Yes. I mean, Donald wolf, Huey, pretends that they really want to eat the kids. And of course, that is scared for a kid this is someone coming up do you want to eat you? And again, and here here, here's us a switch because now Bark is not referring to the humans anymore. Yeah Ducktales.

153
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:14,944
Yeah. Need to do that to make it work in this story because it comes roast humans. Right. Kits. Because the sensors would not have liked and roast.

154
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:26,870
That's true. I I think in this era of Western Publishing, he was still getting away with a little but but he was starting to get a lot of push Barks and we're about to get into a a pretty

155
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:27,990
sensible

156
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,722
period in in a couple of years. And and so

157
00:20:32,139 --> 00:21:01,341
as Donald is chasing them in the guise of the wolf Gyro doesn't really react proportionately. He's just kinda standing there wondering what what went wrong, did I have a dial set to Let me and and the nephews user, like crying out in interior, and as they passed by a tree, we see a figure just the hint of a figure hiding behind the tree. And as Donald as a wolf passes, a a man trips him and to basically saves the nephews Ducktales

158
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:12,210
tells the the wolf the supposed wolf hold on there, you know, you can't harm those boys while I'm around. Donald pretty quickly revealed to that man that it's all a frank,

159
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:52,350
and he he pulls off the head of his costume and tells him Not a wolf. I'm Inducks. And y, do you mind telling us about how this man responds. Well, he's just laughing. And is this bedding half of it buddy I'm not a dog. I'm a wolf. And this is just the beginning of the exact same dialogue. As Done spoke before, is now the dual saying, and he's reacting this same way. It says that it passed between two funny boxes that was sitting beside the train, and he wants cooked food, rose jack, and he established chased out, exactly the same way that Donald chased and nephews So we got this the same sequence.

160
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:57,740
Yeah to from another the perspective. Yeah... Yeah. You said it perfectly. It's it's

161
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:09,650
it's a really confident thing to do. Right? Because as you say, he's it's almost verbatim. Right? It's almost word for word that he's saying Donald lines. Barks

162
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,825
and so Donald is like, I I know where this is going. His hair is growing.

163
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:15,245
That

164
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:18,725
image of the the real wolf. I'm masking

165
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:27,679
himself. Again, I read this one probably at age eight, and that's stuck with me because as scary as Donald looked this is a really upsetting

166
00:22:28,615 --> 00:23:09,572
idea. Right? A wolf that can talk like a human, I mean... I mean, it's it's the old trope of like, a werewolf basically. Yes Yes. And I consider this one of the scariest things that Barks put in his ten pager and honestly, I I think it's up there with the regular economic to meet maybe it's... Maybe it just lands like that to me, but I I thought that that was a very disturbing image. Yes. I can only breathe. And and I mean, it's in a good way. Right? Because it it gets you like really invested in this story and now you're worried for Donald. And and the nephews have just run off. Right? And when they realized that they're not being pursued, they backtrack,

167
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,646
and they are able to see

168
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:30,746
the the tracks that that indicate Donald sc with this real wolf. And we get another great story be here that that tells us what that updates the nephews on what happened. What is It Y? Yeah. It's a rabbit a total rabbit but, of course, also past those boxes.

169
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:35,340
Much to the nephew surprise and Ducktales

170
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:43,015
and nephews, which way Donald and the wolf were heading so know they are trying to find him before it's late. And when they see...

171
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,308
Go ahead he's all tied up. Ready to be

172
00:23:46,885 --> 00:24:07,467
roasted by the world. The and the wolf is trying to make a fire. So now they have to move fast think quick. And back to ge, who still only thinking about his think Barks He doesn't care if it kids and oh chase by is only thing about his inventions. Yeah. It's very single mind in this one. Yeah. Yeah. And then,

173
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:14,864
the kids asked first for a solution, and course, because it's a jeans and inventor, it comes up with Al solution in the Jiffy. And

174
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:44,690
then the nephews takes the pink boxes with the beams And and, yeah, they set it up, you know? And and, you know, before we hit that last page, I just wanted to note, what a neat way it was to, like, introduce that rabbit? It's a great little story element. We needed the nephews to be updated. With where Donald gone, and this was a nice way to do it, I think because Barks casually gets to throw in you you never show one.

175
00:24:45,303 --> 00:25:00,570
If if you have a a high concept element in a story like this, you know, you don't show one animal that's able to talk. Usually, Barks follows the rule of three is what I've noticed, but there's a lot going on on this one. So he at least had to get one other talking animal in there.

176
00:25:01,425 --> 00:25:15,250
I guess, I guess arguably Donald was the the third one. But anyway, the Ducktales will set it set it up and in the nick of time, as as the wolf is garnish donald, he's become so human.

177
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:19,391
He has a a favorite garnish he likes to use a little bit of sage.

178
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:26,970
They are able to transform him back into a regular thinking wall and the wolf runs off and an animal

179
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,130
fight, and and they save they saved donald old. And

180
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:48,694
Y kim, do you wanna take us home on on the ending or do you have any comments beforehand? In the end here, we see the docks and ji won't away, and it turns out that an nephews will write all along, Jared is the genius. The think Barks worked and it even saved donald. From death, and

181
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:56,805
they say that you can never tell what wonderful things are going to be invented by crack as you call them. And during this sequence,

182
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:05,280
Donald doesn't say word. But I think I know what he is thinking. Because I've been thinking a lot about Jai the the relationship

183
00:26:05,913 --> 00:26:23,670
between the drugs lately. Huey, might just be thinking that gyro might actually be genius. And maybe Jeremy's betty for the kids than I am. Am I a good parent? Maybe I better. And this yes gets too much for him. Then see the rabbit again. He acts a beg and say mister,

184
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:33,469
spare time for a bunch of carrots? It just snaps for donald. And it says, oh, shut up. And it's such a wonderful handing seen thinking

185
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:36,021
this final off page. It is

186
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:36,858
go

187
00:26:37,435 --> 00:26:40,607
within just shouting at in innocent as rabbit

188
00:26:41,104 --> 00:26:42,162
is is nothing

189
00:26:42,674 --> 00:27:03,098
I wonder if that could be done today, and same thing with the beg, the rabbit because Al is, quite a sensitive thing here and canon eighties at least. How will you portray if the tray figures Al adult in comments? Just economics. Yeah. You were mentioning that to me before we started recording, and I thought that was fascinating because I don't think that would be a controversial

190
00:27:03,436 --> 00:27:03,936
element

191
00:27:04,314 --> 00:27:08,580
in the states. Some someone might correct me. I think if if they were dressed

192
00:27:09,237 --> 00:27:11,770
like like, coded as homeless,

193
00:27:12,186 --> 00:27:19,878
than than it might be. But I know that at this time in the states, you know, the idea of the tram the bag wasn't was a pretty common

194
00:27:20,256 --> 00:27:34,361
comic trope. Barks has all kinds of comic burgers in the backgrounds of stories. As you said before, also, this story is a second store with the jira and Barks of course developed the character later on. So

195
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:46,067
instead of being this scribble w brand crack? Al stomach puts it? Later on, in comics and storage one hundred and fifty three the fishing story, Donald meeting in by and calls

196
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:50,555
fabulous and then day. Something must have changed here. Because

197
00:27:50,975 --> 00:27:52,355
in the stores between

198
00:27:52,855 --> 00:28:01,247
counts stores one hundred forty one and one and fifty three, other artist also trade ji and the Net use Al sort of the

199
00:28:01,785 --> 00:28:04,603
assistant, etcetera. I didn't know that there were other

200
00:28:05,182 --> 00:28:19,927
non Barks gyro stories that quickly. I I knew that, you know, he immediately he became a popular character. But didn't realize that it happened that fast. Yeah. We did. It did. The interesting. And they kicked Barks original concept because I guess, either

201
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:27,788
they saw themselves on the comments or the address who say, hey, we'll gonna a new character here here's how it works, and please do a story with him. Yeah.

202
00:28:28,986 --> 00:28:34,090
It comes to stores one hundred and Severino one is again refer to a fabulous event

203
00:28:34,628 --> 00:29:02,492
and I'll actually seek him out when he sell. So he no longer he's no longer the guy that you do who thinks he's cool, but he's not a friend of Donald. So what happened there? I I think that could it be that Barks for a Donald need friend? Because actually, he didn't tell any friends before. That's true. Yeah. Donald doesn't have a lot of people characters to just bounce off of. Right? It's it's interesting to me. He he must have just thought that he would work better not to be

204
00:29:02,831 --> 00:29:03,331
antagonist

205
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:22,430
against him. I mean, sometimes he even gets lumped in, like, with the, like, donald duck family kinda of representations. You know, he's not a family member, but he's like just outside the family almost. Yeah. So, yeah. So I love the story. I think that this... As you said, it's a really neat ending.

206
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:36,425
I love how the rabbit is set up just beforehand to give it that little comic sting at the end, I I love Donald walk of shame where he just pee is soul came because he knows he was proven wrong. And

207
00:29:36,882 --> 00:29:48,183
and and maybe he was proven wrong enough. That you know, that's where he ended up going with the ji and and and maybe for one Donald duck actually learned than something. Yeah.

208
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:57,120
But Have you seen the other version of this story? Are you thinking of the, like, the follow? To or in nineteen sixty,

209
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:04,643
there was four color one shot called. This is your wife, Downtown. Oh, yeah. The the one red

210
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:28,059
red, almost entire number. Yeah. That's right. I forgot about that. I'm sorry. I spoke over you. Tell me again, Tony Str. Tone str did Am so red withdraw redo version. Of this store. I have seen that. It's been... It's been many years. I wonder if I have the original because I I remember vividly reading it and being very puzzled.

211
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:42,833
But obviously, this is a story that really stood out if they used it for that element that that celebration of Donald Inducks. But if I if I remember right, when the laptop still rep that this is your live dot they substituted

212
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:45,565
the struggle version with the Barks version. Right.

213
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,148
Kind odd because the styles doesn't match but

214
00:30:50,525 --> 00:31:02,801
I can see why they did it, but I might not agree that it was a good choice. Sure. I know that str bowl is is a bit divisive to many Barks fans. Which which is fine.

215
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:04,097
But but yeah,

216
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:06,446
So highly productive

217
00:31:07,262 --> 00:31:14,194
and had so many different ink. So from time to time, you got a bad ink. I know that this is the lifetime doc. It's

218
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:15,273
swapping

219
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,429
my opinion.

220
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:17,307
But

221
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:26,613
sometimes when had the it could be real good. I... That's my opinion. Yeah. I I think I'd agree with that. I think he you know, he got to do a couple of of

222
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,643
collaborations or or, I guess, finish

223
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,916
with Bar, so barb, obviously,

224
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:34,642
I guess I won't say too much about struggle.

225
00:31:35,098 --> 00:31:42,406
There are probably some some people really like him. Do you want to be to really hard no territory about this story. That's...

226
00:31:42,844 --> 00:32:03,763
I'm a man with a podcast all about all about Carl Barks. So that that hits my sweet spot. If you look at the first page of this story, the very first page, you will notice this if you compare it with with the first printing on the fifties. The pages does not look the same. Because what you're looking at, if you're looking at the glass or reprint, for example, Right? Pages cut. And

227
00:32:04,142 --> 00:32:04,922
it is...

228
00:32:05,621 --> 00:32:06,280
So very

229
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:10,088
scan open from index. They've had a scan of

230
00:32:10,626 --> 00:32:16,289
Walt disney con one forty one. Huey, will notice especially in the panel where the whole says

231
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:17,329
earth.

232
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:22,429
The docs have been red drawn and why am might ask. You have theory?

233
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:26,982
What which panel is it? First page panel five

234
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:30,932
man, I think that I read something about this.

235
00:32:32,028 --> 00:32:34,539
Researching another episode and now it completely

236
00:32:35,277 --> 00:32:46,944
escaped my memory. So so please tell us. Well, it was actually another doc fan pointed this out to me is some two years ago because I hadn't noticed before. And obviously, not the person's

237
00:32:47,244 --> 00:32:49,999
doing their complete Barks collection here in Scandinavia,

238
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:59,511
but the thing is that back in the late sixties, when it was reprinted, they had cut the first page make room for the information about the publisher etcetera.

239
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,488
And then they remove Donald and the voice from,

240
00:33:03,027 --> 00:33:08,731
they moved things to round the page, I'm on Gladstone. We're about to reprint this or another rainbow

241
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:13,334
for the car box library in the Us. The original proves we're not.

242
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,804
So they have had to sort of recreate

243
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:23,007
missing parts and try to make a look as close to the return as possible. But

244
00:33:23,346 --> 00:33:33,126
the missed if few things did notice just a few things, So it has never been published again, I think since the Severino zero scandinavia eighty, the sixties in the Us wow. Is

245
00:33:33,783 --> 00:33:39,124
originally drawn. That is a great detail. I appreciate that. But I recently made a

246
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:47,131
restoration picks for Pixel that a hope can be used in the future. Wow, that's awesome really cool detail. Nice. Thank you for sharing that.

247
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:51,663
I tell that it was know territory but I mean, I love.

248
00:33:52,201 --> 00:33:52,701
And

249
00:33:53,279 --> 00:34:05,524
if I can just with the one page, it's just just. Oh, yeah. What it what it thrilled to be able to have, you know, this this this is me trying to kinda have whatever involvement I can. In

250
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:19,674
in the Disney comics and in the in the Earl Barks realm. So I I appreciate getting to learn about that. So, you know, why don't we talk about Ji your a little bit. Right? He... This is pretty humble beginnings, but it obviously,

251
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,364
like stuck with people if if their commissioning stories

252
00:34:24,864 --> 00:34:32,138
redoing this one, you know, fans remember this story and Barks obviously like the character enough to

253
00:34:32,597 --> 00:34:37,670
to use him a lot. Yes. Of course. And even of the scandinavian Ducktales,

254
00:34:38,604 --> 00:34:45,924
the the beginning in the sixties. We'd used a lot over here too. And it's still pop is in the new Ducktales.

255
00:34:46,244 --> 00:34:54,006
Mh. Tv series for example. But, of course, it hasn't look the way it did in the beginning. Yeah. Know it was a bit chu,

256
00:34:54,405 --> 00:35:17,654
and now it's so super slim and thin. It's true, he went through a pretty big meta or pretty pretty quick on, you know, he had a a pretty chu, like almost sloppy look to him. Yeah. But this is common for characters in their first appearance, you know, Scrooge Mcdowell and Gladstone Gander or other secondary care that got expanded and their look got refined

257
00:35:18,271 --> 00:35:23,889
You mentioned that duck version of him. I I found that one really off putting.

258
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:34,790
I did not. That design, I I think it's I just basically been ninety to seventy to one model sheets or working can looks like that, and it is in the video to meet Al. I I just found his

259
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:39,533
characterization. He his his gyro has always been, like a very genuine

260
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:43,853
warm character like scatter range, but this one is is

261
00:35:44,231 --> 00:36:07,521
outright mean, and that's fine. If you wanna have that kind of character great, but I... You know, I think the original Ducktales probably was was much more in in keeping with the characterization is as much as Mark's fans will will criticize the duck. I I think they got Gyro is pretty right. But but, yeah, the character Barks would go on to use him as as, like his own

262
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,490
main care and a lot of stories. Yeah. And,

263
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:24,764
I mean, he got his coming but for a while. A couple of one shots. I mean were there three or... Yeah. I don't remember. I don't I don't know that one off the top of my head. But most of those stores were written by a Big clock one of my others. Oh s.

264
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:27,194
Just through them. But

265
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:37,690
quite okay. Yeah. And I find it interesting that, like, there's this weird fact. Right? I might be getting this wrong. But my understanding is that sometimes he featured ji

266
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:53,015
because of this weird rule with the Us postal service. Oh yeah. Where they weren't allowed to... They wouldn't permit comic books to be sent through the mail that featured more than one story with the same character

267
00:36:53,554 --> 00:37:12,484
as the lead. And so Yeah. Am I getting that right as far as you know? Yeah. Sure. Because used must backup stores in on Scrooge. Yeah. But a weird... What a weird convention that that that kind of Us postal service regulation would dictate comics. How about if we talk about... I I do like to mention

268
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:22,227
how this story is regarded by fans, I use Inducks as as a a representative for that. It's not perfect, but it's a pretty good way.

269
00:37:22,846 --> 00:37:38,515
And according Inducks where fans can vote on the stories, this one is is a very highly regarded story. It has a seven point seven out of ten, which makes it rank one hundred and fifty four out of all the forty one thousand some Disney comic.

270
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:41,022
That are on the site. Yeah. And

271
00:37:42,076 --> 00:38:06,140
they're really really good stories. Story. That tell so so much about the characters and it's also so Al introduction to to giant. So... Yeah. Deserves. I agree. I think it does deserve it think it may be a little bit inflated just because it's his, like, first appearance, but it's it's a memorable story. It stands out to me. And you kim, I'm enough of a nerd that I

272
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,018
made my own list,

273
00:38:08,517 --> 00:38:13,286
like a little spreadsheet where I I pulled out the ten pager from that ranking.

274
00:38:13,886 --> 00:38:20,632
Just so that I could see how they compared to each other. And and so I can tell you that this is the fifth most popular

275
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:30,059
okay. Of of Bark is ten pager. So pretty pretty highly relayed rated. The only the only ones that rank above it would be trouble with dimes,

276
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,380
Glad stone first appearance wintertime, wage,

277
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,420
stat,

278
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:44,555
spend f and and the tear of the vehicle boys. So a lot of first appearances there. But but I understand it because it's Al not only a scary story. It's also

279
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:54,500
story that triggers your imagination as a kid. I mean, that if you had a think box, if you to make your own animals think act like humans.

280
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:58,131
It's triggers the imagination. Absolutely.

281
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,448
Yeah. You're totally right. You know, some of Barks best

282
00:39:01,827 --> 00:39:06,617
ten pages are like wish fulfillment ones, right? Where kids get to imagine themselves

283
00:39:06,955 --> 00:39:09,293
in in the place of Hue dewey in Louis,

284
00:39:09,672 --> 00:39:16,120
maybe being Gyroscope assistance and and helping them out and and having these pool adventures. Yeah. Awesome.

285
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:18,138
Have you seen the

286
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:30,630
the other store where the think Barks disappear? So I know that Don Rosa featured them in a story. Are you talking about that one or are you talking about Al? Bush. I wrote the store back in the nineties.

287
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:42,599
Or barrel politics. Awesome. Thrown by the car. I think it was published in the Us. It's see on shaking index. Yes. Back in ninety eight. No to six hundred and twenty two.

288
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:55,505
So he's obviously a fan. He remembered this the story and wanted to use that elements again. That's awesome. So that's that's a few creators. Right? Because because Rosa of course, was commissions

289
00:39:55,939 --> 00:40:10,025
like specifically, Was that by you guys? Oh, I don't know. I'm know I think it might... I think it might have been E mod who commissioned, but I but I don't know. But, anyway, one of the European Publishers Commission Rosa to do

290
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:13,904
a sequel tying together a bunch of the nineteen

291
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:14,998
fifty

292
00:40:15,574 --> 00:40:16,074
one...

293
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:19,557
Excuse me, Nineteen fifty two era stories,

294
00:40:19,995 --> 00:40:21,292
including statues

295
00:40:21,603 --> 00:40:22,462
spin drift.

296
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:35,609
This one, the think box ball, Christmas for Shack down. And was there another one in that story? I'm looking it up right now. It it sure is an story from two thousand and one. And I I just reread it.

297
00:40:36,048 --> 00:40:38,320
It's it's a really fun sequel.

298
00:40:38,694 --> 00:40:43,314
And and it it uses Bark pink boxes to kind of

299
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:44,234
retroactively

300
00:40:45,134 --> 00:41:08,039
explain the origin of Gyro rose helper. Oh, it's been while it's already. So maybe I should read it again. Yeah. It's it's an awesome one. I I thought it was a great follow, I really liked it. It's a neat sc and Donald story that's really all about ji. So I I do like to mention when when there have been sql or follow ups, and I'm glad you mentioned I didn't remember

301
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:25,889
the ge one. I will have to take a look and see if I have that. I own most of the early number six hundred while Disney comics and stories. And then the... You said it was drawn by... Is... I always imagine his name was pronounced to v carr. Is that How do you say his name? You know, I don't have a clue.

302
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:30,963
Okay. I I just said the card, but that is probably a swedish

303
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:31,581
pronunciation?

304
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:35,872
That's that's neat. It's good... Yeah. It's been to... This one is obviously

305
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:37,189
really

306
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:55,363
held up very well because fans remember it very fondly. Any other thoughts? Oh, I don't wanna forget that I do like to ask people and I didn't I didn't remind you ahead of time. I'm sorry. I like to ask people if they have any favorite panels that really stand out to them from a story. A good question.

307
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:03,747
Let's split back through the Barks. Library and see if I can find it again. While you're looking, I I will just point out that

308
00:42:04,123 --> 00:42:09,538
most of the pant panels that I consider my favorites and this one. They're pretty predictable.

309
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:14,414
It's the kind of payoff shots of the the

310
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:42,424
unveiling of the wolf and how frightening that wolf looks. Because that's just really I will say that it it scared me a little bit as a kid. I think this one is pretty scary. And then maybe especially the one of the wolf trying to create a fire as he prepares to rose stumbled over a spit because that that is both funny and frightening a same time. Yeah. If you ask me, the first power that would probably come to mind

311
00:42:42,964 --> 00:42:54,311
would have been the dog revealing himself to be able Yeah I'm not even that it that is the best withdrawal or the most effective panel, but I sure remember it. Yeah. It's jarring.

312
00:42:55,704 --> 00:43:04,015
But my my favorite Al must be the last time on page three. Oh, that's the name of Inducks. Should ever sync slow. Yeah.

313
00:43:05,067 --> 00:43:06,961
You you see how devastated

314
00:43:07,338 --> 00:43:08,157
doll is

315
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:11,880
when the nephew says that there his assistance.

316
00:43:12,454 --> 00:43:14,434
Yeah. That's a great bit of

317
00:43:15,014 --> 00:43:15,994
Mel drama.

318
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:25,643
The other one that comes to my mind oh a couple more. So the one... The one on the first one on the second page where the buggy just launches.

319
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:38,339
There's a great sense of motion to that one, I think. Yeah. And and I love the one with the rabbit with his hands hand out in that begging pasta. I think that's very funny. Yeah. And look Al panel one here.

320
00:43:39,175 --> 00:43:48,754
Dull thinking Well it here this spam pump speech. Other the places, is it the fourth of July and that makes no sense whatsoever,

321
00:43:49,214 --> 00:43:50,074
press and scandinavia

322
00:43:50,508 --> 00:43:54,365
Right. So if I remember right, I think it was fireworks Barks

323
00:43:54,744 --> 00:44:01,911
because it was published I think in January nine to fifty three, So it makes more sense. Oh, for, like, New Year's celebration?

324
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:05,168
Yeah. Nice. Yeah. That's a fun detail. Excellent.

325
00:44:05,547 --> 00:44:10,399
Well, y king, do you have any any other inside or anything else you wanted to point out?

326
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:14,659
No. Just it was fun talking with you about this story, and

327
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:16,794
I hope we do it again. Soon

328
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:22,594
Absolutely. I'm I'm so grateful to you for joining me. I really appreciate. I had a lot of fun.

329
00:44:23,134 --> 00:44:35,202
It is always great to get to talk to Duck fans and and people are welcome to reach out to us on the Barks remarks Facebook page. And I look forward

330
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,917

00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:40,414
thanks again. Thank you.
