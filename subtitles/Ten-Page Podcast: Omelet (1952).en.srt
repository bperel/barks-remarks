00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:09,384
We have

00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:32,215
Hello, and welcome to Barks Remarks.

00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:39,380
Welcome back to Barks Remarks. I'm Mark Sever of Grown man who enjoys Inducks comics,

4
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:40,333
and

5
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:51,945
I am joined by a very special first time guess that I'm I'm very decided to have on the show. I'm joined today by John Lust,

6
00:00:52,522 --> 00:01:02,504
and and we are gonna be talking about one of Barks all time great ten page stories. For this episode of the ten page

7
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:06,073
podcast. So I'm gonna ask him to

8
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,221
introduce himself and and tell us a little bit about his background

9
00:01:10,598 --> 00:01:13,190
with Carl Barks and with dot com.

10
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:18,944
Okay. Hi, Mark. Well, I started with I was a newspaper reporter

11
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:19,905
edit

12
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:20,984
photographer

13
00:01:21,564 --> 00:01:33,655
for a small newspaper chain for about the first ten years of my working life. Previous to that when I was in college, I actually sold my first comic book story to Western

14
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:37,575
publications, which was published at that time under gold,

15
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,360
I did a Daphne Ducktales

16
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:46,313
pager. And then I got into doing newspapers and I didn't have time to do that I mean,

17
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,447
comic books. And so

18
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:50,485
after

19
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:57,327
those ten years, I've been doing comment writing comic books, and for about twenty five of those years,

20
00:01:57,706 --> 00:02:01,882
I was writing Inducks stories, Disney deduct stories, and

21
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:02,921
I

22
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,975
started out

23
00:02:04,554 --> 00:02:07,531
being teamed up with my friend Bill Van horn,

24
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,768
and I worked Al little bit with Carl

25
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:12,686
sort of That's complicated.

26
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:16,934
And I'm met all number of times. And after we died, I got to

27
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:24,652
complete some Karl and un completed stories, some of which have appeared here in some of which happened. So... And

28
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:29,014
unlike a lot of the hardcore Inducks

29
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:29,554
fans

30
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:30,927
Inducks

31
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:31,467
writers

32
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:34,872
let's say, like, Rosa or

33
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:38,754
van horn I did not really grow up on Barks

34
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:39,714
I

35
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:45,745
read one dot one Barks story. I remember from when I was a kid. It was the

36
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,079
ten cent Al, which was magic with spells

37
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:55,094
second appearance. Oh, yeah. And I I enjoyed that. But I didn't know who Carl Barks was.

38
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:56,054
And

39
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:58,694
shortly after that, I

40
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:02,094
discovered superheroes and I was buying comics for myself

41
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:03,188
finally.

42
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:04,983
So I was lost on

43
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:09,489
superheroes until somewhere in my college years. And

44
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,762
then I found a couple of

45
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:12,594
Barks

46
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:15,811
comics Al a garage sale, and

47
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:33,971
it was the golden helmet and a trick treat. And I was I was Al English major and a journalism major, a that double major. And just as a writer, I just I was just totally blown away by those. I mean, I couldn't have been more

48
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:40,445
surprised and shocked And that's when I became a Barks fan. And So I approached

49
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:45,268
this maybe from a little different perspective. It's it's not

50
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:55,339
nostalgia for me. It's like, oh, my god. This is these were particularly the goal helmet, which is my favorite Barks adventure. Oh, yeah. And

51
00:03:55,955 --> 00:04:00,922
it was like... And and trucker treat took of finding fine. Sorry, too. But

52
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,192
it was like the... These are two of the

53
00:04:04,904 --> 00:04:11,044
comic stories, best stories period. I've ever read. And I was just Slack jaw

54
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:12,604
dumbfounded

55
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:29,389
completely bold over but years later when I got to meet Carl, I took those two comments with me, and I don't think he had ever had anybody and these were the most beat comics you could imagine. Right. And I love Yeah.

56
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:41,104
Well well love, and he picked them up and he just waved him in the air back and forth because they were, like, paper obviously, paper, but they were especially thin and floppy,

57
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:44,104
and I don't think he didn't had any po

58
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,360
in such bad shape that he'd been asked to

59
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,879
sign. Most people are having

60
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,334
probably be because you know, and

61
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:58,565
that was fun. Now I've still got those Scrooge away somewhere in my collection, but

62
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,055
Anyway, and and as I said, I I did

63
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:04,931
sort of collaborate with him on

64
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,865
as story. And pat walked

65
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:13,745
through that and they did a great job on that. But there was some interference on

66
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:16,594
part of some people at the Barks studio,

67
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:25,297
that kinda sent a story in a weird way away from what Carl had in attend. And so years later, I...

68
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:26,613
With my editor

69
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:35,006
approval, we we redid that story as somewhere beyond nowhere. I and done. Yep this dr it, and

70
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:41,335
I think it's much closer to what Carl like. But it it's unique to have two different versions,

71
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:48,455
completely different versions of one of Carl stories like that. And... Yeah. And and it seems like

72
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:57,741
Don Yet is usually involved when there two different versions. Yeah. Yeah. Well it's so good. And is such a huge Barks fan, and

73
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,235
my editor is no longer

74
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:07,950
working at the... Unfortunately, Byron as far as Eric and as far as I know, is no longer editing that Gladstone.

75
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:22,445
But he... Yep was his favorite artist, and I supposedly was his favorite writer, so he wanted to tame us together when whenever possible and done Al the the little things that I did of Barks

76
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:42,630
after that too. So... That's really neat. I I came across that that you had done another... An additional version of it kind of been looking up some background for the episode and I haven't gotten to to see that one, so I'd be really interested in checking that out. So I was just gonna say, there's a lot time unpack in in your opening. Right? Because you you are

77
00:06:43,448 --> 00:06:46,984
As you mentioned, I've gotten to have Patrick blocked on here. He's

78
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:50,515
fantastic artist I've had a couple of other duct creative,

79
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:51,595
Henri,

80
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:53,795
House, and

81
00:06:54,855 --> 00:06:55,355
Y,

82
00:06:55,815 --> 00:07:03,116
the the editor at E, I think he's done smart as well, but you're first time I've had someone on who's done Inducks writing, And

83
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:09,525
I I just I wanted to acknowledge that I'm I'm a really big fan. You know, you mentioned the Gladstone era.

84
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:10,742
Just

85
00:07:11,477 --> 00:07:16,972
chuck and appreciating your appreciation. And since you mentioned the Gladstone error,

86
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:20,161
you were getting into that. There only

87
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:21,078
three

88
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:26,921
lancer brought on it Gladstone. And in Cla one, the first right.

89
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:28,519
For was Rosa,

90
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:33,409
then it was and on, and I was friend's bill,

91
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:47,316
and it's sort of work together a little bit. He's some of my plot on the last issue of his own series called Nervous Service rat. Yeah. And I asked since bill doesn't

92
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:49,528
Al for the most part.

93
00:07:50,386 --> 00:08:11,503
I was sort of his liaison on when I went down to the San Diego Comic con and and talked to Gladstone stone and got information on how he could submit. And when bill started doing this stuff, then he started... He was doing, you know, donald up uncle sp, and then they asked them to do Ducktales and he's and he said

94
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:13,341
do you wanna do some

95
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,862
with me. And so that's really where I started. Oh, wait a minute. Before that, Mh. Before that...

96
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,304
We did some... I did a couple of one pager and a couple of two pager,

97
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:29,233
and that's really a great way to start

98
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:37,457
Everybody when they start writing. And I know it's through in the duct world, but it's probably true and and any established

99
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:38,736
universe

100
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:43,217
common universe. They wanna do, like, four zillion different characters.

101
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:47,602
And they wanna do that a forty eight page or sixty four page

102
00:08:48,074 --> 00:09:00,659
story so forth and, you know, But starting really small is great because it teaches you how to get just what you need in, and it helps teach story structure

103
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:15,805
too. So anyway, that's just my reflection on how to get started. These those are great that sounds like great writing tips to me, and and I'm definitely interested in talking about story structure, you know, as we go through our story today.

104
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:25,495
And I don't I don't wanna wax on too much about it. But, like, you mentioned beat up comments, you know? I oh it's I think it's blurring thing it's boring

105
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:29,776
on but I... But But this is the issue.

106
00:09:30,473 --> 00:09:39,214
Yeah. That that this was probably one of the, like, first three or four comics that I I ever read. And and just by everyone. I I

107
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:41,074
so... And for people who...

108
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:47,249
Who don't see each the video you're talking about... I think it's Ducktales number seven. Yeah.

109
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:57,479
Win windfall on mount Ga guide. I don't I don't remember all my titles, but I remember that That's such a a memorable title to me and it's such a Za story.

110
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:01,195
And and those that collaboration that you and

111
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:06,503
It's funny to me to to think of him as bill. Of course, I think of him as William Van Horn. Right.

112
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:21,650
You you and William Van horn had such a great collaboration. I I have really grown to appreciate his stories over the years. When I when I saw them originally, they didn't always grab me the way that I. There's a certain, like, Barks

113
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:23,506
goofy

114
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:26,114
really odd ball sen

115
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:31,707
to them that's just incredibly unique and and and very funny. Glad I to hear you say that.

116
00:10:32,446 --> 00:10:33,639
Yeah. I think

117
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:40,433
bill has this different approach. And although he's done long stories, and I've done a few long stories.

118
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:43,741
Most of our is in shorter pieces.

119
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,011
And bill is all about to X yeah and sioux football

120
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:50,446
and bill is

121
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,519
like Barks,

122
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:54,639
god is training as as an meter. Right.

123
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,995
Yeah. And I think that of fetch both of their work very much. So.

124
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,634
But bill

125
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:06,834
favorite comic was Crazy cow. Oh, and

126
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:13,352
that that's That's obvious. Right? Right. Right. And if you look at bill's

127
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:28,439
own series his nervous rex, which is being printed. Sure. His style is a a natural drawing style is more in the crazy cat. Version. You know? I I'm glad you said that. I can I can definitely see a lot of hair

128
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:33,333
George George Har? Right? And and that kind of whoop

129
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,569
very

130
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:37,919
realistic. And and I think you're waiting. That

131
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:45,790
sometimes decision and Yeah. And even in bill's Ducktales stories, you can see place placing

132
00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:48,342
weird little things in the background.

133
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:59,057
And buy still a little bit of that where it have different, like duct paintings in the and and the background and you know, I on four zillion du and in and a picture

134
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:01,055
hanging on the walls

135
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:38,457
But yeah. It it's a very different approach than just about anybody else does. Yeah. It's it's very unique. I think in Disney comics. And it's rare to see someone who is not kind of trying to ape Barks, you know, for for a good reason. Right? Because he is the mass so like, I understand what you're talking about There there's something very kind of quiet and understated about that, like, I I can't keep coming back to the word and our but, like, the the van horror stories, they just... They have these rules, but then he just constantly breaks them in in in a way that that's very funny.

136
00:12:38,994 --> 00:12:55,569
Very like early loo tunes very early Barks. I think one of my one of my other hosts. Pointed out that he he is like the air of Barks early stories. Yeah. I I think that's that's a good distinction to make as opposed to is later

137
00:12:56,549 --> 00:13:03,458
stuff and and so forth. And bills ending to stories tend to be very soft

138
00:13:03,794 --> 00:13:06,823
in most cases. They don't have doing...

139
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:08,815
Sometimes I wish they had a little more punch.

140
00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:09,848
And

141
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:23,629
I think when we work together the stories out a little more punch. But but that's built. And and it's a very... If you look at crazy cat, they would do the same thing. It's it's not characters punching each other at the end or you know, of

142
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:28,952
falls. It's just character just talking and a little bit of

143
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:29,869
philosophy

144
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:30,786
or,

145
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:31,362
you know,

146
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:34,612
wisdom or or They kinda trail

147
00:13:35,204 --> 00:13:37,784
like No. Off. And that's how

148
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:52,820
bills stories, not all of them, but some of them a lot of them do. And you just have to appreciate it a different level. Right. I think so. Alright. So thank you so much for Inducks me in talking about you know your own work. So

149
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:54,633
as I mentioned,

150
00:13:55,669 --> 00:14:03,640
we we get to talk about a really great story today. I think I think that most fans if they were asked

151
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:08,720
to name some of their favorite ten pages. There's there's a pretty good chance.

152
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:14,456
That people would name this one, you know, in the first ten or so. I have

153
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:25,011
I was gonna bring this in later, but you're you're... Are you gonna bring in index writing on this? I do. I usually mention Inducks at the end, but you're welcome

154
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,860
I've got I've got something to add to that when you get to that. So... Yeah. Absolutely.

155
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,827
But... Yeah. Yeah. This this is really classic. This is one of the ones people boys talk about. And

156
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:43,034
I was thrilled that you allowed me to to do this one. It was one of a couple that we

157
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:46,825
talked about me doing, and the other one

158
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:48,180
was flip.

159
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:56,299
And I... I've got all the Barks library and I've... I've got so many of these stories in, like, triple or fly

160
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,519
and so forth, but I pulled one of the color Barks

161
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:01,359
Al

162
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:11,465
And mh. I was shocked when I went through that and the... I think, five stories there they've got three of my favorites. They've got on,

163
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,879
the Hip no gun story U. Flip,

164
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:21,319
and that's all in a six month period. Carl was really hitting on all cylinders

165
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:29,808
there As far as I'm concerned, this is, I think, fifty two into fifty three. Boy. I mean, what a great What a great period?

166
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:34,462
That wasn't... I I know that wasn't a happy. And that's also

167
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:41,728
about the time said he did the golden Helmet. Right which I think is one is the great Barks

168
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:42,708
long

169
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:46,519
epic story. And the darkest of his stories too.

170
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:54,210
But what a great period? You know, I mean, it it apparently came out of a period where it was very unhappy.

171
00:15:54,664 --> 00:16:27,615
And it just shows you how you can kind of rise above that, but how sometimes so much comedy is based in I am on paying to to some degree. Yeah. It's just very interesting me. Yeah. You said it. What what a great period of time for him? That's part of the details? That I always mentioned, this one had a cover date of November of nineteen fifty two, along with many of his other are great. Stories around that span. Yeah. It was originally published in walt Disney comments and stories number one hundred and forty six

172
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:29,133
And

173
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:35,865
it's it's had a pretty good number of reprint as you might expect. And in the Us, it's had eight different reprint.

174
00:16:36,558 --> 00:16:51,375
And, you know, they they weren't titled originally. So there was a couple of proposed titles that have alternate titles people used over the years and only kinda just settled on on. But and one alternate title was a town called.

175
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:57,467
And I think a lot of the most memorable ten pager.

176
00:16:57,964 --> 00:17:04,310
John can kind of be dis distilled down to their their hook or they're high concept. Right? And right.

177
00:17:05,044 --> 00:17:05,864
Like flip

178
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:28,466
has has the great coin flip element By the way, that guy at the beginning of the story that side character, He feels like such a van horn character to me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just Al a random side there, But but this one, you know, the... It's the... It's the egg story. It's the chicken story. People know this story. And

179
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:37,830
And, of course, a big part of why I think this one really hits for people. Is that Barks has such a personal connection.

180
00:17:38,384 --> 00:17:40,361
To the story into the concept.

181
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:41,518
Right?

182
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:47,267
Because... Right. This this was his like, this was his backup when he was transitioning,

183
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:48,519
to

184
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:51,335
taking up the Comics full time.

185
00:17:51,935 --> 00:18:01,618
He he reported feeling a little bit uneasy about putting a, I guess, putting all his eggs in the the basket of of comic book making.

186
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:06,769
And so when he and his wife at the time moved out to San Ja

187
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:15,257
his backup was chicken Farming. Right. And and you get the sense from that that he was writing out of out of personal

188
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:17,310
experience. Right? Yeah. Yeah.

189
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:21,177
When we talked about me doing

190
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:26,645
the broadcast the two stories we're talking about where was this one and flip.

191
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:31,774
And both of them are kind of top plot based stories,

192
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:39,349
particularly this one. Yeah. And I tend to prefer more character based ones, but the structure on this one

193
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:50,281
and the way it's plotted and it... It's it's almost a blue blueprint to how Karl did stories, and then we'll talk about that later. But

194
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:57,528
one of the other reasons I wanted to do it be because I knew to Carl was a chicken farmer, Right And and

195
00:18:57,986 --> 00:19:01,403
so some of this is, like, based on personal experience,

196
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:03,040
and there's

197
00:19:03,554 --> 00:19:08,054
one panel in there is so ironic once you know that. And

198
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:12,549
what I didn't realize at the time until I started researching for this

199
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:14,265
podcast was...

200
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:16,537
I didn't realize that this was

201
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:41,535
often the the story Karl got Al his favorite ten page. Yeah. Yeah. I I encountered that same fact and it's so funny. I've been... I have kind of a running thing where I track all of the stories that he has called his favorite over the years, because, like, he did it for so long but, of course, he he'd answer different ways. But you're right when he when he talked about the ten pager,

202
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:55,080
at least, this is usually the one that came up, and I I think you can really feel his personal connection. It's easy to remember at it's easy to visualize him kind of yeah thinking about his own experiences.

203
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:58,009
Sure. And it's a goofy

204
00:19:58,746 --> 00:19:59,805
funny concept

205
00:20:00,502 --> 00:20:03,335
that that was that was the only thing. It's just a goofy.

206
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:05,525
Sorry. Yeah. Absolutely.

207
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:08,016
Let's see.

208
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,007
Before we actually dive into the story,

209
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:15,295
I... I'm just gonna read a quote from an interview he gave.

210
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:21,329
He he had said that when he left the studio, he really wanted to get to a dryer climate

211
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:25,236
because quote the air conditioning was knocking the hell out of my sinuses.

212
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:31,431
And so you... He said that the only way he could think to make a living was to have chickens.

213
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:40,135
And so he he he basically he didn't wanna have have anything he had to take, like, to take care of on a routine.

214
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:44,341
And he said they made him a little bit of profit before he phase them out.

215
00:20:45,019 --> 00:21:07,397
But he ultimately found couldn't take care of chickens as well as right and draw. And, you know, comics were what made what paid him more money. So thank goodness for that. Right. And I think comics are not noted for being a particularly well paying field. So anytime it pays better than your day job, quit date.

216
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:12,599
Right. Yeah. You've gotta gotta a jump on that. I'm sure. Right So...

217
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:14,155
Alright. So,

218
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:16,948
John, we're gonna jump into

219
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:23,595
the the meat of this icon story. And I'm just gonna kind of na some of the

220
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:31,887
the broad action on each page and and in in between the pages, you know, you and I gives some commentary on the the art

221
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:40,895
or anything that strikes us. But especially, I definitely wanna think especially about the riding. Since I'm fortunate to be joined by you for this episode.

222
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:43,535
So so right away, on

223
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:45,615
opens up with this

224
00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:50,665
I think it's a an interesting device. Something that he has used

225
00:21:51,164 --> 00:22:00,435
before. Right? It... It's got Donald and daisy and the net. Fuse driving. They're they're just entering the town of onwards.

226
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:03,730
And and we see that it's population

227
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:10,290
thirty. I I think that's kind of an important element, right? That it's this tiny little bird. Oh, absolutely.

228
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,290
And

229
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:16,185
So you know, to me this this device that he uses is is this, like, passing

230
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:17,645
through town,

231
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:29,572
and and he is gonna take some time to kind of do a big flash. Right? The bulk, the meat of this story is gonna be this flash that is told

232
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:33,765
He's telling it to Daisy, but really he's telling it to the reader.

233
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:39,560
And he uses this great hook, which is the town's goof ball name of.

234
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,520
And as Daisy is pondering,

235
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,240
why on Earth, it's called.

236
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:52,200
The the Nephews in Donald are kind of distracted by put donnie

237
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:53,078
disguise

238
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:58,117
and having this conversation about, you know, you can't possibly

239
00:22:58,495 --> 00:23:02,544
intend to drive through the town. It's not safe. And

240
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:13,207
and, you know, I I love this. Right, Daisy is an avatar for the reader? Who's wondering what the heck is going on. And so yeah. And then go ahead. Got up. Know. No. That's...

241
00:23:13,864 --> 00:23:14,364
Now

242
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:20,570
what I wanted to say about this page is... And and you're absolutely, right, that easy

243
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:34,086
serves as the he has a very small role in this story. She this there at the beginning and at the end. But with not daisy, there is no reason for donald to do a flash.

244
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,380
And without the flash, if you told the story just straight, donald wouldn't be the narrator.

245
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:47,995
And being the narrator really add something to the story. Gives it... It it says a lot about Donald attitude

246
00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:49,195
and and

247
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:50,690
towards down

248
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,370
until forth is revealed to the narration

249
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,130
addition what happens and so forth.

250
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:07,559
But I I could be wrong on this. But it might be the only story where donald there separates his own direct. I Know. That's I I think there's another story that has

251
00:24:07,935 --> 00:24:20,376
this same structure where he did one of those soft remakes. Do you remember the one... I I don't remember the true title, but I think it's called, like, mount much more where it's it's kind of the same thing where they're driving

252
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:23,786
through, and he's explaining about this

253
00:24:24,164 --> 00:24:42,803
disaster that he inflicted. I'm sure you're right. I used to be I'm sixty nine now I used to be able to keep all five hundred almost all five slots in my head. And I just can't do it. I don't even remember all my stories at this point. But Right. I mean, I have the benefit of being an obsessive

254
00:24:43,261 --> 00:24:51,606
podcast host. And and, you know, doing these active searches when it when it's... But you're right. This is a very rare story structure

255
00:24:52,079 --> 00:25:04,861
for Carl Barks, and I... That's part of why this one has to stand out. Right? Because Oh yeah. It's a great point you made. He... He's a very reliable later, but we see his... We hear his attitudes

256
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,137
about kind of the town and and what happened.

257
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:13,030
Right. And it it's great. This is such a great setup. Two

258
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,330
on it's very economical. I even though, you know, in ten pages,

259
00:25:17,825 --> 00:25:20,325
voting Al pays is quite a bit of

260
00:25:20,745 --> 00:25:22,405
percentage of the story. But

261
00:25:22,905 --> 00:25:34,925
in the very first panel, you get in the name of the town that is only thirty people, at least only thirty people now would have been bigger before donald they had just

262
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:36,961
donald there. And

263
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:46,070
you get... And if you look at the for the readers who aren't following along with the comic in front of them, Daisy has this kind of physical

264
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,150
look on her be

265
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:54,603
and that first panel. And then as you watch the panel progression, the kids are explaining

266
00:25:55,102 --> 00:25:58,638
kids in dog are going like, okay. Do we have to go through

267
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:18,829
and and and don't have any other way around and here's the disguise and Daisy eyes get bigger, and there's there's actual sweat marks coming off of her I I guess that's what they are. And anyway it's so concerned and she's on the fifth panel. She actually looks kind of frightened.

268
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:24,151
And by the last panel, she's actually looking angry with Donald like,

269
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:29,094
yes. By all means explain what's going on, In terms

270
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:35,060
of physical action accommodate, there's almost nothing that end this page

271
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:40,129
except it's very funny, and it's all based on reactions. And and

272
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,325
to some extent

273
00:26:42,782 --> 00:26:46,872
Donald point of these absurd disguise and cell and the kids.

274
00:26:47,871 --> 00:26:52,407
I did wanna mention that the sixth panel and you have donald

275
00:26:52,786 --> 00:26:53,765
and Daisy

276
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,529
actually going through the town and to emphasize what is sleepy...

277
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:07,357
And and oh, I'm sorry. Going back to base. Panel. You have the town in the background and donald and a

278
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:08,194
daisy

279
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:16,233
and silhouette and And so it really focuses your eye on the town. So you get a sense of

280
00:27:16,732 --> 00:27:25,965
location and so forth And then on that next to the last panel, they're going through actually going through the town and to emphasize what a small

281
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:27,585
sleepy town it is,

282
00:27:28,518 --> 00:27:33,688
there's someone in the on the side it's somewhat of a stereotype. It's.

283
00:27:34,824 --> 00:27:36,735
Sleeping, you know, taking a Cs

284
00:27:37,593 --> 00:27:39,729
and there's a dog in the street,

285
00:27:40,187 --> 00:27:45,250
sleeping, and there's a cat there who's just kinda looking at the dog and

286
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:49,402
or oh there's a car coming. No. How unusual?

287
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,459
You know? Right.

288
00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:52,316
You know? And

289
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:59,445
and there's a sign on the wall going count sale, which is not what you would get in most

290
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:08,812
communities. And just describes it tells you so much about this community and so much of the... It's just a beautiful piece of storytelling

291
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,745
setup so absolutely.

292
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:19,025
Just a handful of these details, he paints such a a great picture and this really economical. He's only got ten pages.

293
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:30,399
To do that. And and when I started writing comics, one of the best pieces of advice I got from an editor there was don't just have the characters

294
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:37,537
talking and doing stuff. Try to get fit in as much as you can. So it'd be very economical

295
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:38,349
and

296
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:43,329
maybe you're often trying to do two things at the same... Same time. And

297
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:45,895
Barks does this beautifully

298
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,015
throughout that first page.

299
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:53,635
So yeah that's all had to have about that. Those are great details. I I really appreciate that.

300
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:59,496
And I... I'm gonna add that I love the the boys look of apprehension at the last

301
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:04,819
That that Everything about this first page is so

302
00:29:05,396 --> 00:29:10,606
intriguing to the reader. It's not a mystery story, but Barks is setting up this mystery.

303
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,100
What the heck happened in

304
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:27,795
and how is it connected to the docs? And I agree that Daisy acts as the reader here And when... I'm sure when I was reading this story the first time, I had the same reaction as daisy.

305
00:29:28,295 --> 00:29:28,375
Yes.

306
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:31,285
Heck is going on.

307
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:34,159
You know, it's just so perfect. Yeah. That's all.

308
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:37,610
That's perfect. It makes for such a great page turner.

309
00:29:38,304 --> 00:29:38,804
So

310
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:45,445
so on on the second page, we do start to get kind of the lay of the land. Right?

311
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:58,021
And Donald actually presents it as a story. He says the story begins a little over a year ago when I rented that farm on the hill up there. And we get kind of a gradual

312
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,060
look at this hilltop top farm that the doctors are gonna

313
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,440
gonna inhabit for a while.

314
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,900
And as as you say, we get a great sense of place of.

315
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,340
Right? The farm

316
00:30:11,532 --> 00:30:12,032
stands

317
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:12,648
Mh.

318
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:26,280
Quite a bit above the rest of the town. And can we learn in this panel where where Donald looks really a mu or or for Lauren that the town used to be called pleasant Valley.

319
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,513
So so we're building a little bit. A little bit to what's gonna happen.

320
00:30:32,252 --> 00:30:36,628
And and basically, it he explains that they intended

321
00:30:37,007 --> 00:30:39,000
to... This was one of Donald Get rid

322
00:30:39,498 --> 00:30:42,171
schemes, he wanted to become a chicken farmer,

323
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:55,269
but did he say, he said, I'd heard that farmers were getting rich so I set out to raise chickens. That line cracks me up because... Because you don't generally hear about farmers getting rich. Right? I and

324
00:30:55,648 --> 00:30:56,747
that was actually...

325
00:30:57,286 --> 00:31:06,504
When I read the story where like I was going... Yes. This is why I've that if nothing else was why I wanted to do that at the story because call

326
00:31:06,922 --> 00:31:09,715
knew that you didn't get becoming a farmer.

327
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:10,410
Yes.

328
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,990
The contrary commentary on and stuff and

329
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,190
un donald,

330
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,350
and I personally...

331
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,324
And mcdonald's not a very pleasant person

332
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:28,340
throughout this story. And... Right. It it doesn't... I think Carl had a great respect if you look at, like, the middle and story

333
00:31:29,077 --> 00:31:31,544
or the story he's delivering

334
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:33,058
the mail

335
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:48,615
again Blizzard and s for. Probably had a great respect for the working man and for the particularly people who doing things every day, and we didn't get much attention. But I don't think he had much respect for

336
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:53,923
people who wanted to get rich quick. Yeah And I think that's one reason

337
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:54,762
Donald

338
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:57,487
doesn't get treated

339
00:31:58,143 --> 00:32:04,616
trade very... He's not a heroic occasionally, he's a royal character. He's not in this story. Right.

340
00:32:05,893 --> 00:32:08,349
That's a great point. You're right. He really

341
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:09,985
he really

342
00:32:10,683 --> 00:32:11,840
this hard work.

343
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:19,586
But you know, he hates Gladstone gander or one of his, like, most famous characters you can tell. He does not like him.

344
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:28,816
And so, you know, they... Barks does a great job of just setting up Donald and the nephews learning the ropes,

345
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:30,231
farming chickens,

346
00:32:31,043 --> 00:32:35,770
We see a little bit of passage of time and we learned that the chickens are not growing

347
00:32:36,107 --> 00:32:45,090
or rather they're not... They're not laying eggs the way that donald dixon specs them too. He's just feeding and feeding them. We see his little

348
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,250
johns into the town for supplies

349
00:32:48,684 --> 00:32:51,138
his noisy truck is is annoying

350
00:32:51,914 --> 00:32:55,444
the locals. We get this sense that they they really

351
00:32:55,941 --> 00:33:03,883
dislike him being there. And by the end of page two, Donald become impatient with their slow rate

352
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:05,735
and he whips up

353
00:33:06,672 --> 00:33:07,111
this, like,

354
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:15,547
collection of vitamins and minerals to make them legs. To do you mind telling us about some of the things that go into it? Pool

355
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,420
oil,

356
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,800
tu time,

357
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,300
main pure and heat pills.

358
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,095
And this is

359
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:25,975
one of... I think this is the first

360
00:33:26,315 --> 00:33:37,092
indication actually, going back a panel, can I go back a panel just very brief wait? Absolutely, anything on this page is game right now. Okay. He's holding up one of the chickens,

361
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:40,540
and the chicken looks like it is gotta it by the neck.

362
00:33:41,434 --> 00:33:49,525
And and he's looking at his glance of... As his like pure murder and the chicken looks very nervous and

363
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:50,898
I think those

364
00:33:51,955 --> 00:33:54,052
these chickens need a special buyer

365
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:58,881
me. And his solution to that is to

366
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:00,613
come up with this

367
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:02,890
special mixture of

368
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,726
we call vitamins and manager

369
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:07,856
just... It looks

370
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:10,128
a perfect way to poison

371
00:34:11,461 --> 00:34:12,639
Right. And

372
00:34:13,175 --> 00:34:14,605
this is really the

373
00:34:15,622 --> 00:34:21,391
thing where his get rich feelings sort of manifest them himself action

374
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:22,269
and

375
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:23,906
we'll have many other

376
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:28,186
instances of this. But each one of those

377
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:34,737
makes things much worse. So this is the first one. Right. Yeah. He's he's really gonna sabotage

378
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:36,731
himself in this. So

379
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:40,696
we we see the results pretty quickly of this very Barks

380
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:47,589
he makes. The Nephews tell him that the chickens feathers are really quickly falling out.

381
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:59,797
And I like John how he he flashes back and forth, right, between the Inducks on the farm and down in the town, and the the towns people's reaction to everything.

382
00:35:01,028 --> 00:35:02,746
It's a it's a great structure.

383
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:08,880
They see the feathers all gathered there and they they think that they're in for an early

384
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:09,854
snow

385
00:35:10,273 --> 00:35:10,773
and

386
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:16,565
and and, you know, if you think about some of the progression of this, it it it it doesn't really

387
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:25,130
It falls apart under scrutiny, but it it definitely works with, like, comic book lodge. Right? I think it's very tight for chronic lunch.

388
00:35:26,025 --> 00:35:31,724
Because this this early snow approaching makes them all realize that they need to seal their roofs

389
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:43,790
against rain and snow and so everyone in town goes out to tar their roofs which which is something that people really really do or did? I think we probably mostly use other materials now.

390
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:49,199
And and by the end of the page, Donald is trying to turn this into a into

391
00:35:49,736 --> 00:35:55,440
something that can benefit him, he realizes, hey, we can gather and sell these feathers to pillow makers.

392
00:35:55,933 --> 00:36:13,184
Yeah. And and so Donald has tendency in this thing to go from his thoughts go from, like, a to immediately to z instead of b is c or d. And, you know, in terms of... Let's get rich and he doesn't think things out. So

393
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:16,258
And I I just wanna

394
00:36:17,114 --> 00:36:18,931
say a couple things here.

395
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:24,715
Yeah. One the those poor chickens, it's it's I wonder they're not dead.

396
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:26,932
Y'all lucky, they just

397
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:28,371
lost their feathers.

398
00:36:29,682 --> 00:36:30,182
But

399
00:36:30,758 --> 00:36:32,893
they're both pathetic looking

400
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,485
and frankly kind of funny.

401
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,280
Yeah. Is And

402
00:36:38,216 --> 00:36:38,609
it's

403
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:41,247
getting to your point about comic,

404
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:47,121
and I know what you mean by that, but it's... I wanna break that down

405
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:52,717
what in comic books, at least in some creators for some creators,

406
00:36:53,651 --> 00:36:54,965
particularly if you're doing humor,

407
00:36:56,538 --> 00:37:04,482
If it's not shown on the page, it doesn't exist unless you want it to. And so the villagers,

408
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:05,838
the tone people

409
00:37:06,255 --> 00:37:07,553
who are down below

410
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:08,870
looking up

411
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:14,627
and seen all this white on top of the hill. It's not a mountain. It's a hill.

412
00:37:15,243 --> 00:37:18,892
And the fact that they haven't seen any snow coming down,

413
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:20,303
They're all wearing...

414
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:27,446
Doesn't... Definitely not summer I did not some where, but not not atlanta particular

415
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:41,529
You know, it it's it's not obviously not cold out. They haven't seen any snow. But because we don't see it, they can jump to the conclusion like winter coming in already, you know, early winter are coming, you know, it...

416
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:43,007
And then

417
00:37:43,746 --> 00:37:48,019
another bit of calling logic is that everybody in town immediately

418
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:49,379
together,

419
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:51,579
right, is are their roof.

420
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:53,394
Yeah. They they a

421
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:54,912
party, like like

422
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,149
Barks raising or something.

423
00:37:58,527 --> 00:37:59,027
So...

424
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:00,465
Yeah. That was

425
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,515
And and then to see

426
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:04,468
donald and the boys,

427
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:07,179
breaking all the feathers

428
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:09,252
together Al if there leaves

429
00:38:09,644 --> 00:38:13,020
and not really thinking about what might happen afterwards.

430
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,976
It's it's hilarious and

431
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:16,855
comic.

432
00:38:17,848 --> 00:38:22,698
Right. Right. It it's great. I really appreciate your calm interior. This is exactly

433
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:25,013
why I what to to come on.

434
00:38:26,364 --> 00:38:27,423
Okay. So

435
00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:33,816
if you are versed in kind of the the tropes of classic cartoons

436
00:38:34,475 --> 00:38:40,369
and and our gang and little ras schools and and all this plastic quantity,

437
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:48,357
you probably already expect what's gonna happen. When you put get a bunch of tar and a bunch of feathers

438
00:38:48,855 --> 00:38:53,906
introduced. But... But I I love John, how even though this is incredibly predictable,

439
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,160
the payoff,

440
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
what's gonna happen.

441
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,492
On on the very first fiasco, is is just magnus.

442
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:22,275
And and I I agree with all that. The only thing I would say is If you're ten years old and you're reading this or even as an adult and you're reading through and it's like, what happens next you may not sync that far ahead, and you wouldn't think it was caused badly

443
00:39:22,815 --> 00:39:23,095
does.

444
00:39:23,735 --> 00:39:31,075
Right. That and that's true because this you know, I have the benefit of hindsight and thinking about the called early implications.

445
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:37,473
Yeah. And I I had the same experience reread it. Yeah. Yeah. And and so...

446
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:48,709
So as Donald says a horrible winds storm, came up and and the dub try to you know, block off the feathers from blowing away. But but the inevitable happens,

447
00:39:49,206 --> 00:39:51,440
the feathers all blow down.

448
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:53,275
Into Pleasant Valley,

449
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:55,335
we see the town's folk,

450
00:39:55,735 --> 00:39:56,235
particularly,

451
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:58,355
who will learn is the mayor,

452
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:02,170
you know, running for their lives less they be sm

453
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,730
and we do see the mayor trip himself into

454
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,610
a tub of tar

455
00:40:08,484 --> 00:40:13,637
and and one of the women in the town cries out. Our city, our beautiful village,

456
00:40:14,117 --> 00:40:15,555
hard and feathers.

457
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:22,270
And the great comic sting at the end of this page is the mayor saying if you think that's Al calamity,

458
00:40:22,828 --> 00:40:25,123
take a look at me the mayor.

459
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:33,726
And and he is. He is exactly as hard and feather as you would expect. And as the classic

460
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:34,539
and

461
00:40:34,877 --> 00:40:44,615
everyone knows this, but I should I should say it out loud. Right? Tar and feather is like a a classic form of I mean, if you go back far enough, it's like it's torture,

462
00:40:45,035 --> 00:40:46,695
but classically in American

463
00:40:47,035 --> 00:40:48,775
society. It's a humiliation.

464
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:53,125
Against someone usually that you wanna run out of town. Yes.

465
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:57,741
Yeah. And and in real life it must've have just been horrific. But

466
00:40:58,054 --> 00:40:59,193
common watch.

467
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:01,388
Right. Right. Right. But

468
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:02,985
I wanted to...

469
00:41:03,523 --> 00:41:06,976
That that panel where the mayor is

470
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:10,264
his he's running down the ladder.

471
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:24,757
And he has cleaned up against the house as as the feathers are coming down, and there's a And I looked at that when I was reading the reread the story, and I got, oh my god. Look at the ways coming down low that letter. Nobody

472
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:34,510
could possibly come down that ladder safely in real life, and then you see the payoff in the next panel we're he can't safely go down the letter.

473
00:41:35,388 --> 00:41:39,579
He's he's running down the ladder and you can't run down a ladder.

474
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:41,370
And he just goes

475
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:47,005
tips right over into the tire. And as beautiful. That last panel where you see the mayor

476
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:50,341
covered in tar and feathers. U.

477
00:41:51,673 --> 00:41:52,971
That's the second...

478
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:54,248
If you count

479
00:41:54,985 --> 00:41:56,222
the opening panel,

480
00:41:57,538 --> 00:41:58,656
which is the double panel,

481
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,290
This is the second double panel of five

482
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:03,910
in the story.

483
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,170
And that's

484
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:08,505
really unusual for Karl to

485
00:42:08,844 --> 00:42:09,344
have

486
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:11,419
that many double panels

487
00:42:11,837 --> 00:42:13,474
and ten day story.

488
00:42:14,551 --> 00:42:17,326
It's a lot of space, but it works

489
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:18,619
to

490
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:19,937
emphasize,

491
00:42:20,796 --> 00:42:25,470
like, the the punch often at the end of the the story.

492
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:32,505
That of the page where you're you're seeing the the the highlight egg for that that section.

493
00:42:32,805 --> 00:42:33,305
And

494
00:42:33,899 --> 00:42:35,715
and and such a visual

495
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:37,949
story except for their opening

496
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:46,549
and closing, a visual, and this story, I think one of the reasons it's such a favorite for is

497
00:42:47,128 --> 00:42:49,866
it almost has an epic

498
00:42:50,379 --> 00:42:53,393
sent to it, and I think these additional

499
00:42:53,971 --> 00:43:16,685
paths help help with that. That's a... That's an excellent point. I'm glad you mentioned that because I I didn't pick up on that. But as soon as you said it, I'm like, oh, yeah, those those full, you know, full width panels. They they Al so I think really give you a sense of the town itself because there's a little bit of breathing room and it's so important to kinda place us within the tabs. So

500
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:18,745
Yeah. That's a great point.

501
00:43:19,385 --> 00:43:24,645
And you know what I... What I was thinking too when I got to this part, and then I went back to reread it is

502
00:43:25,065 --> 00:43:25,565
and

503
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:37,182
I've I've mentioned the rule of threes on the podcast before it's like one of those academic things that people who analyze medium and and it makes them sound smart, but it's really very pedestrian.

504
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:44,426
Right? But but the rule of threes, it is something that Barks was very good at. Right? And in comedy,

505
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:46,397
three is the perfect number.

506
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:53,411
He... It does such a good job of abiding by that. We're gonna get the three big catastrophes

507
00:43:53,828 --> 00:43:56,241
here, and this is this is our first of.

508
00:43:56,698 --> 00:43:58,732
Can we talk about rule of three for a second?

509
00:43:59,329 --> 00:43:59,848
Please yes.

510
00:44:00,486 --> 00:44:05,560
Okay. You're right. Three is sort of a classic number. There's

511
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,400
another

512
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,855
component to. I don't know if it truly plays in to this one.

513
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:20,109
But in comedy right... Well, first of all, if you looked at the old at the old animated cartoons, I've mean, talking about really early. Like

514
00:44:20,805 --> 00:44:24,015
so forth. They would often repeat the same action

515
00:44:24,392 --> 00:44:27,842
like three times or something. And part of that was just

516
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:33,975
saving them from having to reach withdraw things and so forth. Right. But there is a sort of classic

517
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:35,055
pattern

518
00:44:35,515 --> 00:44:39,867
of of doing three, but the other part that from a joke right

519
00:44:40,326 --> 00:44:49,355
standpoint, I just wanted to find this because I've I've heard references to rule three before. Here on the podcast. Yes. What I've listen, but

520
00:44:49,695 --> 00:44:50,635
from a joke

521
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:51,415
standpoint,

522
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:53,089
rule...

523
00:44:53,786 --> 00:45:02,841
Rule three comes in somewhat in that you... What people mean is that you get a pattern with the first two references

524
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,956
and a gag. I'm trying to regular bag. And then the third reference

525
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:12,130
totally breaks that pattern. It's part of the cycle, but in a totally

526
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,017
unexpected way. I just wanted to explain what role free met in a different

527
00:45:17,355 --> 00:45:17,474
context.

528
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:20,806
I'm not sure if that comes in here.

529
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:23,677
Although each of the disasters

530
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:26,206
is unique in its own way.

531
00:45:27,023 --> 00:45:44,546
But Right. This is... This is the first big one. Yeah. And and that's a great explanation that I I haven't fully flushed out. I do think sometimes the the the third is is more about the elevation. And the escalation of it instead of the sub version

532
00:45:45,324 --> 00:45:47,182
in the stack story office.

533
00:45:47,561 --> 00:45:49,154
But if you look the mass...

534
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:57,186
The Brutal mastery stories, which I know you've talked about another podcast. You know, in the B mastery story, as Donald is

535
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,200
somehow

536
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,920
an expert at something. He's very pom and self

537
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:03,840
and

538
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,880
maybe a little annoying.

539
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,095
In each of those. But...

540
00:46:08,595 --> 00:46:16,068
And then I have counted but you now, the first two, maybe three, and then he breaks the pattern with the and

541
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:18,465
at the end where something goes

542
00:46:18,924 --> 00:46:25,770
preposterous to be wrong. And so that's that's sort of an example, the the rule three.

543
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:32,319
I don't know if it's if it's necessarily a three in each case, but it that the rest of the

544
00:46:32,978 --> 00:46:38,353
of that is very much in in that realm. So anyway There's

545
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:41,705
usually that curve ball. At the end. Mh.

546
00:46:43,145 --> 00:46:50,380
So on the next page, you know, we transition and dot Donald, of course, is still is still explaining this.

547
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,100
He notes that they were pretty unpopular

548
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,540
after that point. And they're finding that they're not... Their money is no longer

549
00:46:58,014 --> 00:47:02,723
welcome in Pleasant Valley, and they have to drive all the way to Inducks for supplies.

550
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:05,658
And it's not

551
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:09,285
improving. They're still not getting the hands to lay eggs.

552
00:47:09,963 --> 00:47:10,463
So

553
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:11,940
one of the nephews

554
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:12,858
suggest

555
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:22,610
selling them and and Donald is really annoyed. Al these chickens and so he says that's right. The pot is the place for lazy hands.

556
00:47:23,147 --> 00:47:24,558
And the Ducktales

557
00:47:24,518 --> 00:47:28,967
this is gonna begin sort of calamity number two, the one... One of the many

558
00:47:29,543 --> 00:47:35,205
for the town. They start to drive the chickens out to the market

559
00:47:35,545 --> 00:47:39,685
in the manner that you would... That you had heard Cattle, basically.

560
00:47:40,265 --> 00:47:40,765
Right.

561
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:50,060
And And as you mentioned get this great, like, long shot of them driving the chickens through town. Right. And it hurting

562
00:47:50,654 --> 00:48:03,353
it's preposterous the idea of hurting chickens. It would be like... And I would love to do a story where this actually happens. Where you're trying to hurt cats. It's it's about... That would be even more disastrous possibly.

563
00:48:04,771 --> 00:48:08,136
But pretty Earnings chickens is is great.

564
00:48:08,773 --> 00:48:10,987
Sure. Yeah. It's pretty pretty straightforward.

565
00:48:11,602 --> 00:48:13,630
But funny action on that page

566
00:48:14,964 --> 00:48:19,848
So, you know, the next page is really gonna be all about the kind of predictable

567
00:48:20,584 --> 00:48:21,084
chaos.

568
00:48:21,994 --> 00:48:24,255
That these shipments are causing.

569
00:48:25,074 --> 00:48:29,055
And and but when they get into town, you know, someone

570
00:48:29,768 --> 00:48:36,350
says, where do you leg one cowboys think you're going? And and he tells them well we're going on the railroad station.

571
00:48:37,642 --> 00:48:46,615
To ship the chickens and and the local says listen dumbbell. You don't drive chickens to market like cattle. You haul them in coup,

572
00:48:47,787 --> 00:48:53,911
And and, you know, I think Bark really likes this kind of humor where you've got people acting, like like rooms,

573
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:59,128
or or green horns or chi tacos codes depending on, you know, where you are.

574
00:48:59,966 --> 00:49:10,700
And and it doesn't really make sense with the Nephews. They're usually much smarter than this, but of course, we know that that he'll adjust their kind of clever nest as as needs be for the story.

575
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:17,895
The new don't really have a strong place in this style yeah. World this story.

576
00:49:19,068 --> 00:49:21,883
Donald could have stuck in hired hands

577
00:49:22,301 --> 00:49:23,339
and it was hurt.

578
00:49:24,058 --> 00:49:27,711
Could've have been gus goose if if Barks was horrible that would.

579
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:29,885
That might have even been better.

580
00:49:30,545 --> 00:49:31,045
But

581
00:49:31,585 --> 00:49:34,645
but it could've been almost anybody. And

582
00:49:35,479 --> 00:49:39,815
I mean, this story is basically perfect. So I hesitate to say to save...

583
00:49:40,634 --> 00:49:41,234
No. No. No.

584
00:49:42,152 --> 00:49:42,652
But...

585
00:49:43,671 --> 00:49:46,703
Yeah. Yeah. It it's really donald

586
00:49:47,082 --> 00:49:48,301
versus the villages.

587
00:49:48,999 --> 00:49:57,030
Right. Right. They're they're in incidental. And and we get some of the kind of predictable chaos, but it's still really great to see, you know, chicken

588
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:02,958
walking through cement chickens messing up a China shop worse than a bowl night

589
00:50:03,695 --> 00:50:13,689
a little diner gag where where A man says waiter or we ordered our chicken fried not. Walking. And and I end up having to retreat Barks up their hill. Right.

590
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:17,520
Fleeing from the villages or so upset.

591
00:50:18,094 --> 00:50:19,393
Right. And

592
00:50:20,931 --> 00:50:24,028
that says a six panel where the chickens

593
00:50:24,447 --> 00:50:25,386
are in the

594
00:50:25,765 --> 00:50:26,265
Tri

595
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:27,119
Sean.

596
00:50:28,532 --> 00:50:34,305
For people who aren't in the... From the Us, there's a term called

597
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:45,190
bull and a Tri shop. Mh. And Barks is playing with that. The whole idea of of having a boy China shop, You just know that there's going to be destruction.

598
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:50,130
Yeah. That's a good point. Eric because we... Yeah. It is a a good little American Isn't.

599
00:50:51,064 --> 00:51:04,850
The the next page is basically all about the audit of chickens that Donald performs when they get back to the farm. He counts and he realizes that they're missing one of their ten thousand chickens.

600
00:51:06,101 --> 00:51:09,751
And so, you know, we've got this this funny moment where Donald

601
00:51:10,607 --> 00:51:13,300
en angrily stocks down into the town

602
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:14,337
demanding

603
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:17,286
that they return his missing chicken.

604
00:51:17,886 --> 00:51:23,474
And it's pretty funny because the mob is the the the... I mean, they're out for his blood. But

605
00:51:23,813 --> 00:51:32,065
Donald who you you mentioned he's he's a bit of a jerk. He's a big jerk. In this one. He does have the lawn his side. And so

606
00:51:32,618 --> 00:51:36,727
the towns people trying to fan out to look for this one chicken.

607
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:38,942
And by the end,

608
00:51:40,095 --> 00:51:52,598
we realized that there a baker poke his head out and says no need to look for gentlemen I've found the chicken, and he angrily points to it being immersed in the dough mixer

609
00:51:53,016 --> 00:51:59,398
with with his wife, the other baker crying about two thousand lows of bread ruined.

610
00:52:00,295 --> 00:52:01,952
Do you wanna... Do you wanna read Donald

611
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:07,617
end of the exchange there? You should be jailed for not having lid on that Movie trap.

612
00:52:08,455 --> 00:52:10,394
Because, you know, so

613
00:52:11,412 --> 00:52:15,685
aware of other people's feeling things and the cooper chicken

614
00:52:16,185 --> 00:52:21,405
that chicken is just. They've got a chicken of that. And it's just covered with Google

615
00:52:21,879 --> 00:52:28,475
poop, and there's not a bit of the chicken that you can actually see. And and there's a woman in the background

616
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:29,392
who's

617
00:52:30,185 --> 00:52:31,485
she's just sobbing.

618
00:52:31,865 --> 00:52:32,565
She just

619
00:52:32,985 --> 00:52:33,485
controllable.

620
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:34,525
And

621
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:36,125
it's said oddly

622
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,100
disturbing and funny

623
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,180
panel at the same time.

624
00:52:40,680 --> 00:53:02,771
My main comment on this, and I guess my only other comment really on this is that power, got a a police officer and he's going... We have to help help him find his chicken and much as we hate to do it. And the caption goes the law was on my side. And, again, this is a good example of why donald it's so nice to have

625
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:09,604
in the but what that panel made me think about when I was reread this is donald

626
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,146
is... If you trans post uncle Scrooge

627
00:53:13,745 --> 00:53:17,079
personality onto Donald. That's what's happening.

628
00:53:17,497 --> 00:53:26,590
Donald is always concerned about the bottom line. He not really concerned about anybody else and he's always concerned about making

629
00:53:26,968 --> 00:53:31,110
money and his property and so forth. And

630
00:53:31,848 --> 00:53:32,348
Uncle

631
00:53:33,323 --> 00:53:35,098
Donald is my favorite character.

632
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:47,266
I like Uncle screws, but he's not really the most pleasant person, but Donald is essentially uncle Al the story. That's a great catch. You're right I can totally imagine Scrooge

633
00:53:47,506 --> 00:53:48,940
posed in that shot.

634
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:54,932
The other thing, there there's a men little detail that there's a new hanging in the background

635
00:53:55,671 --> 00:53:57,599
that that oh you're bright.

636
00:53:58,436 --> 00:54:05,010
The towns people clearly they're they're a lynch mob, which which is is just disturbing.

637
00:54:06,228 --> 00:54:17,084
And and, of course, you know, historically that there there's a lot of reasons why you wouldn't see that today. But then it was a common trope that that was used in comedy

638
00:54:17,542 --> 00:54:18,978
as well as as...

639
00:54:19,337 --> 00:54:25,374
And it's it's funny that they're they're out for blood and the police there is basically the only one saving Donald.

640
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:33,608
Alright. What each of these pages is such a nice tight little almost episode in this short story.

641
00:54:34,885 --> 00:54:39,456
The the next page kinda deals with the the after aftermath here

642
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:40,670
Donald

643
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:48,710
explains the towns people sued me, and Bark shows him in front of one of bark Al like wei owl judges.

644
00:54:50,225 --> 00:54:51,245
Being fined

645
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:52,125
for

646
00:54:52,465 --> 00:54:55,325
being found liable for nine hundred dollars damage.

647
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,380
And and there's a silver lining though, the nephews

648
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:05,080
explain. I I really should read it in the progression because the pacing so strong here.

649
00:55:05,814 --> 00:55:10,244
They say don't be so... Don't be down on donald. We've got good news for you,

650
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:13,617
and he says what could be good news

651
00:55:14,009 --> 00:55:17,262
and they explain the chickens have started to lay eggs.

652
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:19,695
You know, the the reader is basically

653
00:55:20,152 --> 00:55:24,841
forgotten that this point because Barks has distracted us with so much. Right.

654
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:33,024
And and so that turns the story around a little bit. Donald is really resided, and he goes up to to the homestead to calculate.

655
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:36,137
And, again, a great bit of dialogue, he's

656
00:55:36,475 --> 00:55:37,653
sc furiously.

657
00:55:37,991 --> 00:55:41,545
Barks occasionally does these great calculation gigs.

658
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:55,460
Between tons of feed at five seventy per C w t ten thousand eggs per day divided by twelve and by seven and and he calculates that they need a dollar a dozen for the eggs to break even.

659
00:55:56,233 --> 00:56:03,960
And and unfortunately, the price is at forty cents at that point. And and so they they engage in some

660
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:05,198
speculation

661
00:56:05,894 --> 00:56:12,414
where they store these massive amounts of eggs, they start storing them until the house bulge

662
00:56:13,444 --> 00:56:16,198
waiting for the price to go up. Yeah.

663
00:56:17,076 --> 00:56:17,576
That

664
00:56:18,952 --> 00:56:23,500
again going for the bottom line. Although, it's understandable in in that

665
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,940
situation. But

666
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,420
I I guess

667
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,820
just Al little bit that I wanna

668
00:56:29,575 --> 00:56:45,424
Ducktales sort of there. Mh. When I was first reading, this story is so the panel were just got the wi out on that owl go Al donald, and he's going... I find Donald Ducktales Liable for nine hundred dollar damages

669
00:56:45,883 --> 00:56:51,795
and Donald going plain highway Robert. And I love the two panel progression

670
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,275
where Donald

671
00:56:53,815 --> 00:57:01,599
excited kind of a smile on his face as he's doing the figures, and he's a expecting to come up that he's gonna make a fortune.

672
00:57:02,493 --> 00:57:04,268
And then the next panel, he's

673
00:57:04,684 --> 00:57:11,376
gets the results and we've gotta get a dollar a dozen for eggs to break even. I mean, just the

674
00:57:12,111 --> 00:57:16,851
between the expiration as case are to me are quite funny. And

675
00:57:17,786 --> 00:57:22,211
the only other thing on that is on the x the last panel,

676
00:57:22,664 --> 00:57:30,957
They've got all these eggs and crates and they're... They've tried... They've moved the stove out of the house right.

677
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:32,629
Boiler room,

678
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:34,385
and the house

679
00:57:34,723 --> 00:57:35,223
is.

680
00:57:35,601 --> 00:57:40,092
There's no room to go in, and it's literally bulging

681
00:57:41,203 --> 00:57:42,779
I just think that's very

682
00:57:43,116 --> 00:57:45,091
funny. It's some great

683
00:57:45,508 --> 00:57:45,628
car.

684
00:57:46,385 --> 00:57:53,570
It is. And and you mentioned the the expressions. I'm glad you did because if you look at every panel,

685
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:54,830
on this page,

686
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:55,890
every

687
00:57:56,270 --> 00:58:02,222
expression is so radically different and and so expressive and and...

688
00:58:02,601 --> 00:58:04,798
I mean, he he was such a master at this.

689
00:58:05,677 --> 00:58:11,310
Alright. So we're we're getting up so that this that final disaster here. Right? We

690
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:12,550
we have

691
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:13,590
some

692
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:14,390
transition

693
00:58:15,305 --> 00:58:26,140
The passage of time, the eggs are piling up. Again, cartoon logic. Were not... The story is bliss we're not gonna think too hard about how long these eggs are gonna last

694
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,953
outside like this. I I gather that, like, high quality eggs you act can keep them

695
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:38,596
shelf stable and don't need to ref them for a while, but but I'm guessing not for weeks and weeks.

696
00:58:40,047 --> 00:58:43,618
But anyway, they're they're accumulating them. The price is gradually

697
00:58:43,996 --> 00:58:50,650
climbing and and they say that Donald says it's about time. There must be a million eggs in that mountain.

698
00:58:51,704 --> 00:58:54,158
And eventually, the Ducktales here on ominous

699
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:55,130
creaking,

700
00:58:55,629 --> 00:59:01,381
and it is the bulk head giving away. Bulk would have been a good vocabulary word for me as a kid.

701
00:59:03,192 --> 00:59:09,311
And then we we transitioned down to the town to get the perspective of these eggs

702
00:59:09,768 --> 00:59:10,268
all

703
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,397
coming down the mountain and

704
00:59:12,775 --> 00:59:13,714
a couple of

705
00:59:14,132 --> 00:59:21,595
horrified looking towns for. One says oh my living soul, and and we get that we get the panel that we've kind of been

706
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,675
anticipating. Right? It's got a gray on p

707
00:59:25,175 --> 00:59:25,675
sp

708
00:59:26,135 --> 00:59:29,290
as the town is just utterly

709
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:34,850
inundated by the this million eggs crashing into the valley. Yeah. And

710
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:36,504
it's sort of...

711
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,750
It's another double wide panel. U.

712
00:59:40,348 --> 00:59:41,406
And it

713
00:59:42,022 --> 00:59:45,207
instead, you know, splash panel, it's a fluke down.

714
00:59:47,018 --> 00:59:48,155
And notably,

715
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,983
I mean, I think you're supposed to apply

716
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:54,146
understand this. Because this is a Disney

717
00:59:54,961 --> 00:59:55,461
comic,

718
00:59:56,157 --> 01:00:01,738
nobody's gonna die in it, and you've seen a bunch of... You see the town

719
01:00:02,197 --> 01:00:09,905
on the other hill climbing up out of the way, and I think you're supposed to feel that all of them magically

720
01:00:10,445 --> 01:00:11,585
got out of town,

721
01:00:11,885 --> 01:00:18,249
and so nobody's harmed or or killed and all this. Sure. It was probably a picnic day or something.

722
01:00:21,956 --> 01:00:23,665
And I... The only other

723
01:00:24,403 --> 01:00:27,417
thing I wanted to say is... And is...

724
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,460
Has there ever been a worst way to store a

725
01:00:33,198 --> 01:00:35,056
I a million of them

726
01:00:35,475 --> 01:00:38,972
on the top of a hill hillside is a a board

727
01:00:39,471 --> 01:00:41,382
in the way. Of them absolutely.

728
01:00:42,475 --> 01:01:08,481
Yeah. And this is such a great payoff. Right? Like, and and we're not supposed to think too hard about, you know, why, like, Can't we see the shelves and and and so on and and, you know, I I always assumed everyone got out okay, but it's it's just he has done such a good job of setting up the progression of the story and the geography of it. That that that it just... It lands so well.

729
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:13,092
And... But we're not done yet. We have one more page.

730
01:01:13,844 --> 01:01:15,860
Where we we get the actual

731
01:01:16,198 --> 01:01:16,698
payoff

732
01:01:17,236 --> 01:01:19,053
which is that the town

733
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:21,647
convene their disaster council

734
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:23,317
the Ducktales

735
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:25,613
for their lives as they must

736
01:01:25,952 --> 01:01:38,726
and and they decide. They determine that the the eggs are too... Basically they're two wet they're too runny. I like to imagine that they can't actually sip them up because they're just like, two vista they're not a regular liquid.

737
01:01:39,139 --> 01:01:44,523
So they they the only way that they can move that massive eggs is to cook them.

738
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:45,581
And

739
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:51,065
he says and to cook them we'll have to, and I think this is the mayor

740
01:01:51,405 --> 01:01:51,905
says

741
01:01:52,205 --> 01:01:54,345
set the town of fire.

742
01:01:55,285 --> 01:01:59,452
And so we We see Donald Mcdonald explains the villages,

743
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:03,143
fried eggs, the hard way, the mayor comments,

744
01:02:03,575 --> 01:02:12,418
I never dreamed that I the mayor would burn down the city hall. There... There's a little aside about it being assured. I'm I'm gonna a guess that are

745
01:02:13,289 --> 01:02:19,806
an adjuster probably wouldn't approve of this. But again, this is chronic logic. And

746
01:02:20,302 --> 01:02:36,502
so they The the poor towns people watch and say our beautiful village is pleasant Al no more when we build again while have to give our town a new name And and so we have indeed found out the story of why that burg is called

747
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:37,240
Onwards.

748
01:02:37,933 --> 01:02:44,233
And and, John, do you mind giving us the little little economic sting at the end, the last two panels?

749
01:02:44,752 --> 01:02:45,690
Okay. So

750
01:02:46,307 --> 01:02:46,807
they're

751
01:02:47,319 --> 01:02:49,774
we're back back out of the flash,

752
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:52,209
and they're they're leaving

753
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:53,805
Donald and

754
01:02:54,582 --> 01:02:56,134
daisy and the boys

755
01:02:56,591 --> 01:02:57,689
are leaving

756
01:02:58,625 --> 01:02:59,125
and

757
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:08,917
they kind bad that's why what got its name. And that goes but you would think those store hats could have spelled it

758
01:03:09,336 --> 01:03:11,333
left of an e at the end. Mh.

759
01:03:12,172 --> 01:03:21,485
For something fancy, after all, Those were my expensive bags. And that's that's the end. It's it's kind of a soft ending. It's it's

760
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:23,818
odd way. It's sort of a van

761
01:03:24,437 --> 01:03:25,097
if you

762
01:03:25,795 --> 01:03:29,412
based on our. And it's just a little bit of philosophy,

763
01:03:29,831 --> 01:03:31,625
a little bit of emotional...

764
01:03:32,045 --> 01:03:34,425
This is what I'm thinking about. And...

765
01:03:34,885 --> 01:03:40,639
Yeah. It's a very ending, but it's kind of appropriate out all this an

766
01:03:40,978 --> 01:03:41,478
and

767
01:03:41,976 --> 01:03:53,645
action and so forth Yeah. It's a it was a just a neat story. I'm actually very surprised that this story zen has got approved by

768
01:03:54,145 --> 01:03:55,977
is hit karl editor.

769
01:03:56,595 --> 01:03:57,893
Right. Although,

770
01:03:58,311 --> 01:04:03,521
carl did Al lot of things that you could not get away with today. Are

771
01:04:03,994 --> 01:04:13,157
I think Carl probably got more lia leeway than a lot of real creditors because We have a lot of goodwill for his output. I've gotta imagine yeah. Absolutely.

772
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:16,807
I mean, he was one of their stars for sure. He didn't

773
01:04:17,265 --> 01:04:20,961
of that, but they did. And right but

774
01:04:21,475 --> 01:04:24,452
going back... Yeah. There there was a panel

775
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:35,960
in in retrospect to getting away the things If there's Al panel, I think, yeah. On the second page where he's holding the chicken by the road and the chicken is looking during their U.

776
01:04:37,055 --> 01:04:41,475
Before, you could never get away with that and in what is

777
01:04:41,815 --> 01:04:43,335
supposedly a kids comic.

778
01:04:43,815 --> 01:04:43,895
Right.

779
01:04:44,735 --> 01:04:49,242
These days. And It certainly couldn't get away with it and Disney.

780
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:52,949
Anymore. It's not in the last few years. They've been

781
01:04:53,286 --> 01:04:55,102
sort of a change and how

782
01:04:55,415 --> 01:04:59,755
Right. I think there are but approved these days. And

783
01:05:00,335 --> 01:05:03,250
it... Yeah. I... He just got away with

784
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:12,335
a lot in the story. And but it it totally works. And sometimes you have to try the edge and go over little bit

785
01:05:13,235 --> 01:05:14,815
to make something really memorable.

786
01:05:15,395 --> 01:05:17,515
Yeah. I very well said, I think.

787
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:31,501
And and you mentioned it's a soft ending, but to me, it feels like that pen ultimate to be, you know, the the conclusion is such a right such a doo that it it it you got a kind of exhale.

788
01:05:31,955 --> 01:05:33,675
At the end that I think. Right.

789
01:05:34,435 --> 01:05:34,935
So

790
01:05:35,635 --> 01:05:39,675
That that was really good. I we had a lot of great things, I think, to say about this.

791
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:49,370
What larry I... I I know we've already talked about this. Right? I think I think I'm an agreement with you that this is certainly an all time great.

792
01:05:50,263 --> 01:05:55,928
But your overall thoughts that maybe we didn't cover about what makes this such a special ten pager.

793
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:57,040
I think

794
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:01,680
covered pretty much what I thought or I have some additional...

795
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,855
As I said, one of the reasons I wanted to pick this story is because it's such a good

796
01:06:08,275 --> 01:06:19,022
window into hell carl created stories. And carl had Al animation background, he was in story department at Disney doing donald dot shirts. And

797
01:06:20,198 --> 01:06:21,577
so... And I

798
01:06:22,075 --> 01:06:24,385
think his way of doing comic books

799
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:26,823
was probably

800
01:06:27,282 --> 01:06:29,739
the same way he did animated stories.

801
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:32,390
Where he would create create as

802
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:35,227
try to think it was... He would have a setting

803
01:06:35,686 --> 01:06:38,583
or an idea, what he wanted to do in a story.

804
01:06:39,442 --> 01:06:42,275
And you've probably heard this too, but Yeah. My.

805
01:06:42,695 --> 01:06:49,810
He... You know, he wanted to drop... Snow. No. Nobody wants to trust. Snow. But he... But he wanted to do a certain type of store

806
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,204
certain study. And

807
01:06:52,661 --> 01:07:04,586
so he would come up he would write as many gag as as he could think of to go with that setting that's flow of action. And then he would try to fit them in

808
01:07:05,084 --> 01:07:05,943
some kind of

809
01:07:06,681 --> 01:07:24,530
chronology, some sort of... And then he would create it would finalize the story based on how the gag fit together, and it would influence I'm sure how the story progressed in terms of content and so anyways, it doesn't sound like a very literary

810
01:07:24,909 --> 01:07:32,420
way to create a story, but it if you're doing Humor, it works really well. And if... And this is

811
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:41,595
so important if you have a really good sense of structure, you can do this. If you don't have a good sense of structure, then it's just chaos.

812
01:07:42,255 --> 01:07:46,169
But Carl had that that sense of structure. And within

813
01:07:46,786 --> 01:07:58,080
and in this case, he had three main gigs. I mean, three main things that go wrong. And then within them, particularly in that second one, he has many gigs

814
01:07:58,499 --> 01:08:00,957
within the gag within the Medic,

815
01:08:02,269 --> 01:08:03,287
you know, the

816
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:05,599
the Ducktales mean, to me the

817
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:10,795
chicken and the batter the Right. Al. The chickens of the

818
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:14,351
china to shop and so forth. And

819
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:18,200
I just thought maybe more than most stories

820
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:29,087
This is such Al a clear example of that here and so that was one reason I wanted to pick this story. Yeah. I I think you're right. There's so much kind of nested

821
01:08:29,426 --> 01:08:34,508
within. Right? Because he's got... He's got this, like, classic bookings. Structure.

822
01:08:34,866 --> 01:08:37,161
He's he does a great job of the book.

823
01:08:37,537 --> 01:08:39,952
He's got kind of the rule of three progression.

824
01:08:40,288 --> 01:08:46,915
He's got the mini gigs within the rule three. And even within the mini gag, sometimes he has these little

825
01:08:47,975 --> 01:09:06,069
reaction shots. These even the expressions are funny. They're almost like mini gigs within themselves. Or or a little... Yeah. Or like the sign of the the the judge is bent and so forth. He like just throw away bags in the background.

826
01:09:06,807 --> 01:09:08,245
He just fits in so much.

827
01:09:09,058 --> 01:09:09,457
Right?

828
01:09:10,135 --> 01:09:13,549
It's so funny but but so tight is...

829
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,875
It's it's a great story. I

830
01:09:17,295 --> 01:09:25,515
I didn't get to read this one until pretty late because I I missed a lot of the reprint and didn't, like, find it until later when I was

831
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:32,096
kinda filling in those holes in my collection. And I was like, wow. I can't believe I've never seen this one.

832
01:09:33,374 --> 01:09:43,685
But but it's such a stand out story to me. And and I've already alluded to this. Right? But this is very well regarded by the overall Ducktales community.

833
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:47,694
We always talk about how these stack up on Inducks

834
01:09:48,134 --> 01:09:57,740
compared to to other stories. And, you know, you're you're another creator. I should preface this by saying, of course, index is like an imperfect measurement

835
01:09:58,356 --> 01:10:01,050
and it's It's gonna be biased towards, like,

836
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:06,645
creators like Barks that people are the most familiar with and these stories that are

837
01:10:07,262 --> 01:10:15,229
sticky. But it is a good a good gauge of, like, just how the community feels about the stories. And this one comes...

838
01:10:15,568 --> 01:10:21,720
This has a rank as of when I was making my notes at least. It had a seven point seven out of ten.

839
01:10:22,293 --> 01:10:28,771
Which is good for number one hundred and fifty seven out of all, you know, forty two thousand

840
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:35,214
Disney comments. That are disney stories that are ranked on the same. That's very

841
01:10:35,633 --> 01:10:40,304
high for a ten pager. Because most people, most fans

842
01:10:40,684 --> 01:10:42,224
yeah they're gonna prefer the

843
01:10:42,564 --> 01:10:44,084
the advantage spas. Yes.

844
01:10:44,924 --> 01:10:48,104
That's a great point. Right? That those are much more memorable.

845
01:10:48,618 --> 01:10:54,345
I just for that reason, I Al couple of times I kinda plucked out the ten pager

846
01:10:55,442 --> 01:10:59,954
and I compared them to each other. So if you're just looking at his ten pager

847
01:11:00,454 --> 01:11:06,088
on their own list, then this one generally clocks in at about numbers seven

848
01:11:06,465 --> 01:11:08,480
or so. Also that's

849
01:11:08,858 --> 01:11:11,032
interesting because I had a note.

850
01:11:11,689 --> 01:11:13,385
I looked at another tonight,

851
01:11:14,081 --> 01:11:17,246
Steve Bark dot Letter c Barks Yeah.

852
01:11:18,124 --> 01:11:24,406
T a. I don't are you with? No. That's a great resource. Definitely. Is. It is. And

853
01:11:24,838 --> 01:11:27,013
It's amazing resource. And

854
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:28,369
they have

855
01:11:28,746 --> 01:11:31,280
ratings for the stories too, but they...

856
01:11:31,857 --> 01:11:32,995
Whoever whoever does it

857
01:11:33,332 --> 01:11:35,603
have a different approach if if I

858
01:11:36,022 --> 01:11:37,480
understand right, with their...

859
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:40,636
He does he or she does is

860
01:11:42,148 --> 01:11:47,071
they look at how many times, the story has been reprint. Right. Which is a different measure.

861
01:11:47,488 --> 01:11:49,560
Yeah. Another great way of looking at it.

862
01:11:51,169 --> 01:11:56,894
Worldwide. I assume that probably has changed is it was first posted. But... And

863
01:11:58,109 --> 01:11:58,786
let's see.

864
01:11:59,345 --> 01:12:00,977
This comes in

865
01:12:02,073 --> 01:12:03,391
Al

866
01:12:03,391 --> 01:12:07,244
in for the comics and stories, the ten pages,

867
01:12:07,862 --> 01:12:09,418
This comes in number five.

868
01:12:10,153 --> 01:12:12,710
Out of ten out of the top ten. Nice.

869
01:12:13,469 --> 01:12:13,969
And

870
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:15,247
the

871
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:18,164
flip... I'll just a few flip

872
01:12:18,503 --> 01:12:21,378
come ties for number nine and

873
01:12:22,118 --> 01:12:25,978
some of the my own favorites etcetera here and matt ring

874
01:12:27,133 --> 01:12:28,313
six and

875
01:12:28,653 --> 01:12:29,153
stat

876
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:31,713
spectrum,

877
01:12:32,813 --> 01:12:34,033
You say call statue

878
01:12:34,693 --> 01:12:41,114
galore. Number four, I know you did a a a broadcast and I had that in it. Right. And

879
01:12:41,971 --> 01:12:43,030
if they have

880
01:12:43,661 --> 01:12:47,109
my... I'm a little hard pressed to go with a def definitive

881
01:12:47,645 --> 01:12:50,495
favorite, but if I had to pick one

882
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:55,991
one, I would go... And you've already done it or I would have requested it. Sure.

883
01:12:56,669 --> 01:12:57,807
But the

884
01:12:58,543 --> 01:12:59,859
the lemonade story,

885
01:13:00,513 --> 01:13:01,013
with

886
01:13:01,471 --> 01:13:02,291
first apparently

887
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:04,988
yeah. Winter time wage. Yeah.

888
01:13:05,946 --> 01:13:06,926
Yeah. That

889
01:13:07,385 --> 01:13:08,343
that's probably my favorite.

890
01:13:08,957 --> 01:13:10,573
Box in is number two

891
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:13,125
on this list. And then

892
01:13:13,741 --> 01:13:22,994
for the most reprinted stories, with the money Bin crib where Scrooge storing all his money and a crib and perch

893
01:13:23,612 --> 01:13:24,112
tornado

894
01:13:25,168 --> 01:13:30,118
with my whip and outrageous is is that everybody becomes a rich.

895
01:13:30,819 --> 01:13:32,458
That's number one. So.

896
01:13:33,218 --> 01:13:35,174
I didn't all. But but

897
01:13:36,234 --> 01:13:42,908
I was g to see so many of my favorites. Show up in the top ten. Yeah. I think there's a sort of Canon

898
01:13:43,247 --> 01:13:47,938
among fans. Right? There's some pretty broad agreement on the top,

899
01:13:48,277 --> 01:14:01,319
like ten or top twenty or so everyone's gonna kinda of position them. Sure they're a little bit different, but but I I think you ask Inducks fan. Sure. This is this is gotta be a top ten story

900
01:14:01,697 --> 01:14:03,035
somewhere around there.

901
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:08,993
I mean, I Right here and there, I have a couple of them that I would probably qui with

902
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:18,784
It's fun to share this. I'll I'll maybe I'll share this list as part of the release for this one and and people can Can debate slash argue over it.

903
01:14:19,478 --> 01:14:24,551
But but I I think broad consensus. Right? This is an all time great story.

904
01:14:25,429 --> 01:14:35,313
If you If as a listener, if you haven't read this one, it's really like, what are you doing? Go go ahead and read it. And and don't listen this podcast until you do.

905
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:40,092
I will say, you know, I've I've...

906
01:14:40,429 --> 01:14:52,977
When I've listened to this podcast, sometimes I don't have time. I'm just listening, and I don't have time to look at this joint. It's so much richer if you're following along and reading the stories Yeah. But

907
01:14:53,396 --> 01:14:55,973
it... I think it's probably a coincidence,

908
01:14:56,352 --> 01:14:56,852
but

909
01:14:57,191 --> 01:15:02,395
it's interesting to me that two of Carl best stories are about eggs. Yeah.

910
01:15:03,392 --> 01:15:05,227
The other one being lost in the End...

911
01:15:06,105 --> 01:15:09,294
Which many people consider his very best

912
01:15:10,191 --> 01:15:10,691
story

913
01:15:11,987 --> 01:15:17,014
with the square eggs. I'm sure some other stories wearing eggs. Played apart, but

914
01:15:17,834 --> 01:15:19,254
maybe easter egg

915
01:15:20,154 --> 01:15:21,094
story. But

916
01:15:22,889 --> 01:15:23,688
But... Yeah...

917
01:15:24,447 --> 01:15:27,003
Yeah. Definitely has to be in the conversation.

918
01:15:27,842 --> 01:15:35,380
Well, you know, this has been a a real pleasure, John. I I really appreciate you joining me before before we wrap up,

919
01:15:36,315 --> 01:15:39,846
we we... We covered this pretty thoroughly. Right? They're there

920
01:15:40,478 --> 01:15:40,978
almost

921
01:15:41,316 --> 01:15:44,291
too many great panels in this one

922
01:15:44,669 --> 01:15:52,134
to to do this feature. But but are there any favorite panels that you would like to highlight that we didn't

923
01:15:52,914 --> 01:15:56,054
already get to kind of call attention to

924
01:15:57,129 --> 01:16:01,265
No. There's some that I've mentioned that I I really like. I I will

925
01:16:01,604 --> 01:16:02,104
mention,

926
01:16:02,682 --> 01:16:04,501
you know, a lot of these flash panels

927
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,513
or these blue panels

928
01:16:07,332 --> 01:16:07,832
are

929
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:10,668
ones that I particularly enjoyed.

930
01:16:11,207 --> 01:16:11,707
But

931
01:16:12,446 --> 01:16:16,909
one thing we didn't I didn't mention we didn't talk about is the number of

932
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:23,784
panels in this thing. And I actually just looking Al at one. So, yeah. Go for it. Yeah. There's

933
01:16:25,244 --> 01:16:28,064
Barks. I mean, I I don't remember his editor

934
01:16:28,485 --> 01:16:29,344
name, but

935
01:16:30,139 --> 01:16:31,360
Yeah. Apparently, it

936
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:38,440
Barks his editor was telling his artist to go and have black placements. You know, it it

937
01:16:40,109 --> 01:16:44,079
not all artists think about placing strong blacks and their

938
01:16:44,696 --> 01:16:45,754
pieces. But

939
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:46,849
Barks

940
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:48,067
was

941
01:16:48,658 --> 01:16:49,358
sort of

942
01:16:50,213 --> 01:16:54,180
unique and how he used his silhouette. And and there's

943
01:16:55,075 --> 01:16:55,575
there's

944
01:16:56,923 --> 01:17:03,517
the big reason for using silhouette to save yourself from drawing. So... Right. And I

945
01:17:03,948 --> 01:17:04,568
I have

946
01:17:04,906 --> 01:17:10,788
I haven't mentioned it, but I I my... The thing I'm doing the most these days I'm doing Al funny

947
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:19,495
web webcam called last kiss. For yeah. I was I gonna encourage you to plug that at the end. And I talked to you there. So so say it again.

948
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:20,350
Well,

949
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,330
last piece,

950
01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:24,730
which

951
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:26,785
happened because I bought a

952
01:17:28,003 --> 01:17:29,102
rights to an old

953
01:17:29,521 --> 01:17:31,099
series called first kiss.

954
01:17:32,157 --> 01:17:33,856
And... But I take

955
01:17:34,329 --> 01:17:37,886
old chronic art and mostly romance, but not totally.

956
01:17:38,605 --> 01:17:46,230
And I red dialogue it, and I do it online, and it's on Go comics, switch with the website, and...

957
01:17:47,046 --> 01:17:49,461
But... And my own website is

958
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:50,458
last

959
01:17:50,956 --> 01:17:51,310
kiss

960
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:52,430
com

961
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:55,990
dot com. Don't go to last guess dot com. Asking

962
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:56,930
dot com.

963
01:17:57,690 --> 01:17:58,190
And

964
01:17:58,690 --> 01:17:58,850
anyway,

965
01:18:00,665 --> 01:18:02,685
Anyway, in the roma Al clinics

966
01:18:03,385 --> 01:18:05,085
from particularly for Toronto,

967
01:18:05,465 --> 01:18:08,085
there's a huge number of silhouette.

968
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:09,539
And

969
01:18:09,998 --> 01:18:12,794
I know it's because the artist which just trying to save time.

970
01:18:13,793 --> 01:18:16,250
Carl certainly was trying to save time

971
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:19,304
but he used them so artistic,

972
01:18:19,605 --> 01:18:20,705
and sometimes

973
01:18:21,284 --> 01:18:22,625
it's like that first

974
01:18:23,284 --> 01:18:23,480
silhouette

975
01:18:24,257 --> 01:18:27,946
we're donald and daisy or in the car. You would have gotten

976
01:18:28,402 --> 01:18:31,572
no benefit from him drawing in their characters.

977
01:18:32,005 --> 01:18:32,824
From the rack.

978
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:37,414
And a lot of the other reason to have silhouette is

979
01:18:38,271 --> 01:18:40,367
besides the art history of it, is

980
01:18:40,745 --> 01:18:49,083
to to focus on the things that are not in silhouette. And Barks that's the master of that, and

981
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:50,015
there's

982
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:52,655
there's a large number of

983
01:18:53,435 --> 01:18:55,335
silhouette here. And

984
01:18:56,115 --> 01:19:00,582
I think that nick so silhouette is just donald on going up the hill after

985
01:19:01,997 --> 01:19:02,497
on

986
01:19:02,995 --> 01:19:04,945
The the gru Grip one

987
01:19:05,405 --> 01:19:06,084
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

988
01:19:06,962 --> 01:19:28,485
That's so funny to me. I was kinda mention that one, too. Right. Right. Right. And it's You would have got and you couldn't have done a close up because you wouldn't have been able till it was going out of town or you could've you could've have, but it just wouldn't have been as effect him. And he was so good at that. And we could just talk about that. And some of the characters

989
01:19:28,982 --> 01:19:35,716
and some of the panels are running the town drum and so silhouette, and that panel was the nuisance.

990
01:19:36,053 --> 01:19:36,553
They're

991
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:42,471
two of the characters, and you don't need to see them. You see them in silhouette

992
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:44,988
with clubs and their hands.

993
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:59,084
And it's such a strong statement of of what they're thinking and what they wanna do. You just wouldn't have gotten anything else. And and it focuses you on everything else in the panel too. So I I just wanted to bring up the seller.

994
01:19:59,624 --> 01:20:01,684
Yeah. That's like... That's a good one to mention

995
01:20:02,304 --> 01:20:05,677
because they are... He uses them in these really Barks

996
01:20:06,675 --> 01:20:21,338
moments a lot. And you really see that on the last page where the Ducktales are... They're fleeing there in silhouette. As the towns people gay on their they're burning town, there in silhouette, and then that final cap, you know? Mh.

997
01:20:23,508 --> 01:20:26,342
That the Ducktales leaving town again and so silhouette.

998
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,598
They are really great

999
01:20:29,495 --> 01:20:33,602
otherwise, it's kind of all the same the the the panels that you might

1000
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:37,115
mention as favorite. They really are very predictable

1001
01:20:37,772 --> 01:20:40,148
in this. It's it's all of the really

1002
01:20:40,487 --> 01:20:42,239
spectacular cad catastrophic,

1003
01:20:42,697 --> 01:20:47,926
things that happen. But I I really wanna again call attention to the expressions,

1004
01:20:48,324 --> 01:20:50,261
especially as you see them

1005
01:20:50,655 --> 01:20:51,155
on

1006
01:20:51,573 --> 01:20:59,280
what was the that page. But you mentioned his near the chicken that he is holding by the neck. But

1007
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,600
also his changing

1008
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:02,600
expressions

1009
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:03,480
on

1010
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:04,520
that,

1011
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,495
I think, that eighth page

1012
01:21:06,993 --> 01:21:23,435
we're just just incredible. And a great example is that merging of his art and his writing storytelling. Oh, I just noticed something. Mh a little different. But, you know, we talked about the chicken being held by the neck. I think it's on page six

1013
01:21:24,133 --> 01:21:25,510
six with town.

1014
01:21:26,247 --> 01:21:27,744
Towns is holding

1015
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:33,420
donald by the neck. Yes. That's a good plan. Is this a little good reverse

1016
01:21:33,879 --> 01:21:34,379
action

1017
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:36,612
and is

1018
01:21:37,348 --> 01:21:41,517
telling them you about how you don't... How you have to haul chickens

1019
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:43,405
in dates so forth

1020
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:46,682
That's just a nice little

1021
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:51,356
reverse bit that there. Yeah. It's it's a great touch.

1022
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:56,670
Alright. Any any anything else that you'd like to mention before we wrap it up?

1023
01:21:57,470 --> 01:22:02,679
We we've covered this if anybody could cover it more. I don't know how.

1024
01:22:03,238 --> 01:22:06,970
That's right. Well, John, no. No. I just

1025
01:22:07,387 --> 01:22:12,729
thank you for having. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much. It's been it's been a real pleasure

1026
01:22:13,106 --> 01:22:18,232
to to get to talk to you about this great story and to get to wax on

1027
01:22:18,946 --> 01:22:23,125
about, you know, when I... When I was nine and ten and reading a lot of stories

1028
01:22:23,466 --> 01:22:24,525
that you wrote,

1029
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:28,591
This this is another one that I read till it was dog

1030
01:22:29,029 --> 01:22:32,042
Al. That that's a big of mine. The two

1031
01:22:32,539 --> 01:22:35,171
no room for human error, the the robot one.

1032
01:22:36,305 --> 01:22:37,085
Can I ask?

1033
01:22:37,825 --> 01:22:47,136
Yeah. Go ahead. Are there any any lines that, like, really stand out to you that you're just really really glad that you wrote,

1034
01:22:47,675 --> 01:22:50,013
you know, what what... In in the dot com

1035
01:22:50,392 --> 01:22:50,892
specifically.

1036
01:22:51,271 --> 01:22:57,334
I I can't quote any of them, but I can tell you I'm particularly proud of

1037
01:22:57,673 --> 01:22:58,691
some of the

1038
01:22:59,030 --> 01:22:59,530
rh

1039
01:22:59,867 --> 01:23:06,363
I did on and some of them where I'd, like, stamped and deliver where I've... He's doing...

1040
01:23:07,059 --> 01:23:08,675
Like, singing the model

1041
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:12,885
the model of this of company where where

1042
01:23:13,185 --> 01:23:20,766
he's got deliver pizza, and I don't remember if it's thirty minutes sixty minutes and he's doing that. And I did that in the

1043
01:23:21,182 --> 01:23:21,682
remake

1044
01:23:22,059 --> 01:23:24,232
the... Some somewhere Beyond

1045
01:23:24,585 --> 01:23:26,925
nowhere where I have ways delivering.

1046
01:23:27,745 --> 01:23:31,525
I I'm particularly proud of those. I can't quote any of them.

1047
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:32,965
But

1048
01:23:33,305 --> 01:23:34,499
yeah. I'm

1049
01:23:35,715 --> 01:23:36,215
diverse

1050
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:37,212
proud

1051
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:38,050
of

1052
01:23:38,627 --> 01:23:41,043
that comic you just held up

1053
01:23:42,073 --> 01:23:47,119
no room for human error, which was a long story for me. And

1054
01:23:47,577 --> 01:23:50,510
someone pointed out to my friend pointed out to me

1055
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:51,520
that

1056
01:23:52,019 --> 01:23:53,077
I actually d

1057
01:23:53,775 --> 01:23:56,111
a person a character in a.

1058
01:23:56,808 --> 01:23:59,822
Probably the only time a character has been to.

1059
01:24:00,655 --> 01:24:03,675
True. It was a robot that it was a thinking tall.

1060
01:24:04,534 --> 01:24:05,475
Sent and

1061
01:24:06,015 --> 01:24:08,554
robot. I I love I got.

1062
01:24:09,469 --> 01:24:20,135
Dialogue and that. That this is gonna cut us off in a moment. But can I tell you you you have in this one You have Scrooge say, oh, deliver me from the wilbur?

1063
01:24:21,112 --> 01:24:23,346
