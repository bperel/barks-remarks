2
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:32,295
This episode is a ten page podcast all about one of his short stories, get ready to enjoy our remarks.

3
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:40,640
Hello. Welcome back to Barks remarks. This is Barks Sever, longtime Carl Barks and Disney comics fan,

4
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:45,864
I've got a returning guest here, who I think would characterize

5
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:47,739
himself as a longtime

6
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:50,109
superhero comics fan. Please

7
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,969
introduce yourself. I'm Ryan Bailey. I've been on before.

8
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:55,469
I

9
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:58,110
have had a subscription to

10
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:02,954
Marvel online for a long time. So I can read all I want. And

11
00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:09,953
I I tally my totals of what I've read, the end of November of year, so it's not exactly on, but I'm comfortably over

12
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,148
five thousand issues by now of

13
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:15,680
mostly twenty first century marvel superhero comics.

14
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:22,456
Nice. So, yeah, you you're definitely a super superhero comic fan. And and the reason that I'm bringing it up is

15
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:31,880
because today we get to cover one of my favorite Carl Barks ten pager. Yeah. This is a new thing I'm doing Ryan. I'm calling Al the ten page podcast.

16
00:01:32,535 --> 00:01:34,205
We're gonna be talking about

17
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:46,731
super snoop. Carl Barks, won and only real foray into a superhero story. You know, this this should be a lot of fun. We can talk about it from those different perspectives.

18
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:50,875
But first, just a little bit of background

19
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:55,275
detail about this story. Alright. So super snoop

20
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:56,195
is

21
00:01:56,815 --> 00:02:05,231
as a ten page. This is one that did not appear in the four colors, which is mostly what we've been covering. This is in the the very long running

22
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:18,260
series Walt Disney's comics and stories, number one hundred and seven. Ryan, the notable thing about walt Disney's comics and stories is that for a long time, it was the

23
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:20,612
third longest running

24
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:23,780
comic book series in the United States.

25
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,890
Do you know what the

26
00:02:26,227 --> 00:02:28,141
the two ahead of it would have been?

27
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:29,518
Probably

28
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:36,276
action comics and detective comics or something like that. Is that right? We nailed it in one. That's exactly. Right. So

29
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:54,545
unfortunately, that's no longer the case, you know, the comments not published. In North America anymore. There are very long running versions of it in places in Europe, I believe. But while Disney's comics and stories got got well into seven hundred issues. I don't I don't know where action comics

30
00:02:54,922 --> 00:03:00,245
and detective comics are. Do you wanna remind us who is featured in those two titles?

31
00:03:01,085 --> 00:03:02,585
Action comics number one,

32
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:05,025
famously is the first appearance of

33
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:05,765
superman.

34
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:12,674
I've got a stack of them and mint condition right here next to me. That the listeners can't see that, but they'll just have to take my word for it. Yeah.

35
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:16,845
So... Alright. So that's that's action comics.

36
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:18,905
And then detective comics

37
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:21,565
features the world's greatest detective that.

38
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,480
And

39
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,080
his his ward and small shorts.

40
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,040
Yes.

41
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:35,835
Was that was his first two parents like number twenty one or twenty two or something like that, I think that sounds right. Yeah. Yeah. No. No fact checking. No fact checking aloud.

42
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,195
Unless it's Disney and Ducktales.

43
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:48,123
And and listeners, if you know the answer, please shout it Al your phone right now. We will wait. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's right. I do remember that now. Yeah. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. Clearly.

44
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:48,962
So,

45
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:53,995
you know, super snoop, just the title to me. It's it's obviously the perfect

46
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,050
ama

47
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,130
of those two heroes. Right? You've got you got soups in

48
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:16,414
in Sup. You got superman represented and and batman man. He's the detective. He's snoop. So I I think Barks did a great job of kind of announcing himself. Right? So the the fictional comic that the kids are gonna be reading in this is is basically meant to serve

49
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:19,007
as a stand in for

50
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,401
the the superhero comics

51
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,707
that annoyed Barks marx so much.

52
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:25,726
So

53
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:28,799
so that this is almost his response

54
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:30,156
to these comics.

55
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:54,193
Let's see. I'm I'm digress a little bit because I had mentioned which issue it was in. I should mention that it it came out in nineteen forty nine. Brian, can can you... I know you're more of a modern age twenty first century, but you you've read enough of them. You can probably give us some idea of what the superhero comics were like in nineteen forty nine. Right? In nineteen forty nine. Yeah. They would have been...

56
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:55,690
What's the right word?

57
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:58,165
Kind of kind of uniform

58
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:02,045
where all the heroes are boy scouts,

59
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:04,865
and they all mostly look the same.

60
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,820
With their square chin and

61
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,660
many of them have the same powers. They all have kind the same values

62
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:13,673
and

63
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:22,025
most... They they don't really do Barks yet by this point. So they're gonna be, you know, probably a new villain every issue or, you know, maybe a turning bill and if we're lucky.

64
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,218
And then

65
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:24,336
they'll,

66
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:40,304
you know, foil the villain by the end of the issue and then and then move on. Right. And and pretty wholesome. Right? Most of them weren't, like, doing kind of the edgy like, Ec comics stuff. Although they were they were violent, but Right. Yeah. It's gonna be

67
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:41,739
very old tiny,

68
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:53,095
you know, like, dip Tracy cartoons kind of style of you know, they'll suck it to the bad guys, but there's there's not going to be any unpleasant language or blood or probably even any, like,

69
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,690
witchcraft or anything like that. It's gonna be pretty

70
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,910
square, you know,

71
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,930
the the faces punching the heels

72
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:02,945
wrestling style, and

73
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:07,705
and that's that's what we get. Yeah. No. That sounds like a good description to me.

74
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:14,026
And I and I guess Al this point in super superhero comics, we we do have those two heroes

75
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:23,425
introduced, but like a lot of the most famous superheroes are not not even around as of nineteen forty nine. Right? Correct. Yeah. Yeah.

76
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:27,279
Spider man was was a glimmer and and his

77
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:29,634
soon to be to deceased parents eye. And

78
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:35,960
so, you know, at this point and lee's, right? Who who who is entirely responsible for his creation?

79
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:38,708
No. I

80
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:42,337
I don't know if the listeners are familiar, but Mark is being facet.

81
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:46,126
There are a number of other people who are more responsible

82
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:55,260
for his creation. Stanley famously would would be like what if we had a guy and he had wings or something Make that a thing. And

83
00:06:56,873 --> 00:07:08,090
and then the artist would create the thing and then the person running that issue would, you know, kind of make a background for them and and make a whole story and so... So yeah, at this point, yeah, we have we have Superman we have batman.

84
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,069
I don't know if we haven't even have wonder woman by this point.

85
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:15,416
There's gonna be some captain America in what will eventually become marvel comics

86
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:19,539
name or is it kind of a modern character that would be around

87
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:20,998
human torch,

88
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:22,936
but not the fantastic

89
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:27,850
four version Correct. Correct. Yeah. The human torch at this point is an Android.

90
00:07:28,644 --> 00:07:46,230
Who punches Nazis along with Captain America. So different torch, not to be confused with the other the other flaming person toro, who is also punching Nazis with Captain America, the two two flaming people on the same team. But yeah. So it it's it was a really good time to punch nazis.

91
00:07:46,644 --> 00:07:48,183
It was a great time. There's...

92
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:51,119
There's really never a bad time. No. That's that's right.

93
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,475
Great time to be punching not.

94
00:07:55,249 --> 00:08:20,744
So there... There's also a lot of comic book companies at this point, a lot of really minor ones and they're just kind of throwing out heroes left and right And so, you know, being like, here's, you know, toe man or whatever. They'll just throw that out and just kinda see what sticks. And, like, if the people. And they're like, we love Tony man or whatever then they'll get some more of that later. But in the meantime, they're just kind of being like, here's. Here's a new guy. He doesn't put up with evil and,

95
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:23,816
you know, he's got a cape and a mask. And

96
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:39,394
and otherwise, wears a suit and time which is also very common back then. So... But we you know, we would we would have the phantom and the shadow and, you know, a few other kind of full time sort of guys that you'll see in other forms later. Right. And those are usually serial.

97
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:44,014
Sure. Yeah. Those are the ones that I guess did get some real continuity.

98
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:45,407
Yeah. And that

99
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:49,233
that would keep billing for a long time. I mean, superman was in the newspaper.

100
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:51,385
Star Wars was in the newspaper.

101
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:53,754
Al lot of comics

102
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:55,771
kind of ran that way. Awesome.

103
00:08:56,211 --> 00:09:03,596
Yeah. There there's not too much background trivia about this one just because of its nature as as one of his shorter

104
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,510
ten pager. Just

105
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:10,891
I would note that this one is very fondly remembered by fans. It is

106
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:20,325
much less of a gag story. I think it stands out because it really is like this little mini adventure. And and I mean, it's certainly funny and it's got some funny parts.

107
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:25,155
But yeah, this one is has definitely gotta be one of his most popular

108
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:26,553
ten pager.

109
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:38,285
So the the reason that Barks created this as I kind of alluded was that he he had a bit of an irritation with super superhero comics. Right? And I I think it was an issue of attention.

110
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:40,279
Because he is famously...

111
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:45,119
It's written that he never encountered a kid

112
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:49,013
reading one of his story. And that was very,

113
00:09:49,391 --> 00:09:52,728
you know, that that that annoyed him. And I understand that.

114
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:54,446
Because these were definitely

115
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:11,184
Right? They were hugely popular, they sold very well. Obviously, if it... If walt Disney's comments and stories ran for more than seven hundred issues, you know, someone was buying them But when he was out in the quote wild, Carl marx only encountered these superhero stories.

116
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:14,720
So this is I would say a gentle

117
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:15,639
criticism

118
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,259
of these stories.

119
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:18,439
And

120
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:26,756
Yeah. Any any other comments Ryan before we cover the the story itself? No. I'm I'm sure I'm sure Carl marx is comforted knowing that

121
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:32,718
as our listeners know his fan base was much more attractive and smarter than everybody else. Wow.

122
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:35,811
That that pretty much goes without saying.

123
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:40,234
And and I mean, who even talks about

124
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:45,777
superheroes these days. Right? And completely they've completely slid out of the public consciousness

125
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:51,553
These these stories are are pretty much all anyone can talk about. Certainly in the United States.

126
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,350
Exactly.

127
00:10:52,949 --> 00:11:00,167
Alright. So let's do this. Super snoop. Opens up with donald and counter his nephews,

128
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:07,829
reading a comic together on the couch and in the way that triplets do where they're they're always holding the same comic, all three of them.

129
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:14,424
And and it is a superhero comic. It's it's called super snoop and Donald is just

130
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:18,930
So annoyed. He he's enraged to see them doing this.

131
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:20,604
He he's basically

132
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,517
describing super snoop

133
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:23,449
as

134
00:11:24,186 --> 00:11:28,837
superman. Right? Is what he sounds like to me. And, you know, he tells them...

135
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:44,749
I'm not I'm not too sure about the reason he gives for this like super snoop, but he says you know that no man could be that strong. Why don't you waste your time doing something useful? And so he he tells the F used to get out of the house, he needs them to do an errands to the drugstore

136
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:49,149
and get him some a bottle of d pepsi medicine.

137
00:11:49,584 --> 00:12:07,253
Because this stomach is very acid, which sounded a little bit archaic to me, but You know. But, yeah. He tells them to spray out of the house. And and by the end of the first page the f user are dismissing him as an old funny daddy. That that's a great term. I think that we need to bring back

138
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:11,164
and and they can't believe that he doesn't think super snoop.

139
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:16,144
Isn't isn't the Bee needs. Yeah. I remember when I read this page,

140
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:18,636
it's struck me. And reminded me of

141
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:21,509
the nineteen eighty Ducktales. I remember there being

142
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:46,982
recurring conflicts in various episodes where the kids think that Uncle Sc is an old funny daddy or he thinks that they think he's an old funny daddy. And at the end, they assure him that he's not and they love him and they Al love each other and they're happy family. And I I don't think I've ever heard Donald referred to as an Old body Daddy. He doesn't seem that old in the comics. I mean, it's hard for me to tell any ducks age versus any other duck. Other than their size. But

143
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:55,667
but he seems like a young guy, you know, he's always doing like, manual labor and stuff like that. Right. Got like some... He's not a retiree Yeah. It's kinda weird to see him characterize

144
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:57,985
Al as out of step. But...

145
00:12:58,364 --> 00:13:01,760
But but on the next page, you know, the nephews do that thing that kids do.

146
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,154
They wait till they're just out of sight and

147
00:13:06,254 --> 00:13:34,349
and they stopped doing their chore, their errand or whatever, and they they sit down. And and you know, this this memory hits home for me. I I remember vividly having a pile of comics and waiting till I was just out of cider until so my mother left the room and and went right back to reading comments. But they they finish reading their their super snoop comic Ryan, do you mind describing how the the very complex plot involves itself in in Yes. Just.

148
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:35,589
And

149
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:38,324
Barks is parity here is is

150
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:40,644
probably not that far off the mark.

151
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,404
But

152
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:51,033
super Sn is buried under seven trillion tons of rock in a dynamite coal mine, which is probably a pretty good percentage of the earth itself.

153
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:52,013
Right.

154
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:58,624
They've gotta see how he gets out of that jam. And then he flexes his mighty muscles and lifts the whole mountain range like a cellar door.

155
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:05,529
Al one does and walks out. Yeah. This that part really cracks me up right? Because this this feels like Barks

156
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:06,708
basically

157
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:12,714
criticizing the the superhero comics for for all having the same sort of paper thin

158
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:18,685
plot that is essentially always resolved by by the superhero flexing their mighty muscles

159
00:14:19,022 --> 00:14:22,669
and doing the the basic thing. I'm sure some of them

160
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:25,434
did avoid these tropes but

161
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:33,805
but probably a lot of those golden age superhero comics were a little bit same same. Yeah. Yeah. It was it was a developing medium.

162
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:37,112
And

163
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:43,950
I love this second half of the second page where they encounter when they characterized as a messenger boy.

164
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:45,700
It's this

165
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:51,175
incredibly aged man with a beard that that literally drags on the ground.

166
00:14:52,189 --> 00:15:12,125
And they just with a straight face. They're like, it's a messenger boy. And and he tells them, you know, his Barks killing them, he just can't complete the delivery of the package that he's got. And, you know, the Nephews want to offer to finish the delivery for them, but he cautions them. No. You can't do it. It's a it's a very dangerous

167
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,562
package. Also his cap

168
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,767
is entitled wi union. That's who he works for.

169
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:25,326
Yeah. That's great. Instead of Western Union, that's a nice little site guy. Thanks for putting that out.

170
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:39,198
So can I say I... This guy, you know, they're they're reading the comics, and and I'm sure something is going to come in in real life to parallel what the comics are. And this this thousand year old plan.

171
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:44,278
This thousand year old man shows up with a mysterious package, and he's like, Hey.

172
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,809
Oh, I guess he I guess he isn't offering to let them deliver.

173
00:15:48,328 --> 00:16:01,089
But it's it's still this point. Yeah. And so I'm like, I'm like, there's something weird have here. This is secretly zeus or or something else is going on. You know, he... There's... This guy's an alien. There's some kind of deal going on with this guy

174
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:01,966
because

175
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:11,053
There's no real... He's on a bicycle. He's not driving a delivery truck. He's a bicycle messenger delivering a package and he is one past so So

176
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:14,405
this was a red herring for me. This threw me completely off.

177
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:20,369
Not that way you expected from a an air sat superhero origin.

178
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:22,769
Right. Excellent. So

179
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,669
the the nephew the the messenger her boy.

180
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:36,687
Feels that he has no choice, but to trust them because this his ninety seven year old back is just hurting him too much. And he tells them to check the slip of paper.

181
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:45,810
And they read it, and you mind telling us about the the address they have to deliver to Ryan. They have to take it to cosmic energy testing laboratory

182
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,487
at thirty three secret Drive,

183
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:56,612
which is is classic. I mean, that's probably one digit off from from... I'm gonna say the Hulk's origin story. Right.

184
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:02,824
Right. Right. I I smell gamma rays or Yes. Yeah. Alright. So so they had...

185
00:17:03,124 --> 00:17:05,184
They had to do the delivery

186
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:14,399
and they decide to leave the comic book that their at their house since it's on the way. And and when they get to their house, they realize they forgotten

187
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:16,079
mcdonald's medicine

188
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:23,082
And I guess they fear his wrath, so they decide that they've gotta... They've gotta go take care of that immediately

189
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,315
and they faithfully leave that package

190
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:27,887
on their table,

191
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:33,524
which is convenient for Donald, he thinks because he's feeling worse and worse

192
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:39,872
as he's working in the backyard, and then he notices the package and he he very reasonably

193
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:46,590
assumes that they must have gotten back and left the package there. Yeah. We also have on one frame here. We have a

194
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:54,937
bird bath as the kids are walking past their house outside, and there's a bird just totally kicking back in there the way the way

195
00:17:55,434 --> 00:18:08,420
anyone... Any human would after a long, hard day of work, And now the kids are in bed and they're they put their favorite chill on, and they just get in the bath, lean back and close their eyes and put their feet up and and that bert... That bird knows how to relax.

196
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:11,774
Yeah. Like as in many comics, I appreciate

197
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:13,414
the the

198
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:16,154
detailed touches in the background.

199
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:20,744
Yeah. I love Barks site gag. They're they're great and

200
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:23,120
a very a very memorable one.

201
00:18:23,814 --> 00:18:28,594
So, you know, the this next page is great. This is where it kinda kicks into gear. Donald

202
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:30,554
grabs the bottle

203
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:33,886
and he he doesn't see any directions.

204
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:40,574
So so instead of bothering to dos, he just kinda kinda gold it down with a nice sense find

205
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:41,030
Al.

206
00:18:42,984 --> 00:18:46,394
And and we pan to the the wrapping paper

207
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,547
did have some directions.

208
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:50,555
That he overlook.

209
00:18:51,051 --> 00:19:01,100
And, you know, it's it's in cursive. It's a little bit tricky to read on the panels. Do you mind telling us what it but it conveys Ryan. Two scientists in charge of cosmic testing,

210
00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:04,914
caution, these liquid isotopes are or to be given only rats.

211
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:09,749
In theory, they'll make a rat as strong as a horse. You of very sparingly

212
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:10,489
professor,

213
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:14,480
ion Cosmic is the name of the person who has written this letter,

214
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:20,764
which, you know, that's a good... That's a good name for a boy or girl really, You know, if if any of your listeners have a kid,

215
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:25,647
you're going to be having a kids soon, put this one on the list. Yeah. You can't go wrong.

216
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:30,232
So, you know, a great setup here and and Donald

217
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:40,893
finds the flavor of it revolt. He wraps it back up. He intends to send it back. And by the second half of this page, we we do see that he he's feeling

218
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,159
great. You know, he's radiating with

219
00:19:44,855 --> 00:19:50,789
little squiggly lines that suggest how good he's feeling. He he decides he's gonna head back out to the garden

220
00:19:51,126 --> 00:20:07,201
and and get back to weeding. And he grabs that doorknob to open the door and he just rips it right out of the door. He's very puzzled at this. So he he's very annoyed. He takes it to me that the house is just shot construct and he throws it to the floor

221
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,236
where it crashes right through into the basement.

222
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:12,129
Yeah. Yeah. Although

223
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:18,089
I thought the cosmic energy testing laboratory was kind of a silly name, but now that I see that it's probably named after

224
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:20,769
the head scientist professor Ion Cosmic.

225
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:29,465
It makes sense. It's just like, you know, Mcdonald's or whatever. You just named it after whoever who owns the place. The miss no. It's actually a peninsula.

226
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:31,474
Exactly.

227
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:48,877
Alright. So, you know, Donald, by the next page, Donald still hasn't figured out that something is up. And so he goes to push the door open. He knocks it right down and he he he is donald duck, so he's getting pretty mad at this point and he goes to kick the door and anger.

228
00:20:49,336 --> 00:21:03,279
And the door goes flying half a mile as he says. And at this point, he he's starting to puzzle things out and he kind of flexes looks Al himself. And I I love how this page ends

229
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:12,929
you know, this this is very... This feels very golden age superhero to me, Ryan you to tell us about about the situation on the end of the page.

230
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:18,551
A little girl's doll is caught to under a steam roller that appears to be

231
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:19,708
unattended

232
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:20,546
mh.

233
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:25,589
And she's just crying that her dolly is trapped under the steam roller. I also Also wanna add

234
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:36,905
this frame here where Donald is looking at his muscles and going. What is this? Am I imbued with some kind of incredible power that I didn't have before, you know? The look in his eyes that communicates

235
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:41,419
this wonder at his new found abilities or whatever. This is timeless.

236
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:46,279
This is a staple of the medium from the very first... Probably from Gil

237
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:47,534
to

238
00:21:47,995 --> 00:21:48,495
to...

239
00:21:48,995 --> 00:21:51,054
I'm gonna guess Venom one the movie.

240
00:21:51,394 --> 00:22:07,052
But there's there's even even modern superhero fans make fun of the point in every superhero movie where you have the origin and someone has to stop and they do something incredible, and then they have to stop and look at their hands as the their hands are about to explain to them what is going on? But

241
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:13,825
Nope. They're still just hands. They look like hands it's just the same hands you had earlier except stronger now or they shoot things or whatever.

242
00:22:14,438 --> 00:22:23,272
There's no reason for anyone to do that and yet every single person knows does. Yeah. Barks may he may not have liked the superhero tropes, but but he certainly

243
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:29,721
he got them in this instance. You have to follow him. You know, he didn't write the rules. You just have to follow the rules.

244
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,036
Right. Right.

245
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:45,459
So so this is great. You know, by by the next page, Donald explaining that, you know, I can't get your little dolly out from this steam roller. You need a derrick for that. He goes to demonstrate. And un.

246
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:50,309
He he lifts the steam roller with a single finger.

247
00:22:50,728 --> 00:22:51,228
And

248
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:57,701
he thankfully, he doesn't freak out too much because the little girl is right underneath the steam roll.

249
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:04,483
Why would you call that part of the steam role or it's not a wheel. Right? It's not tread.

250
00:23:05,402 --> 00:23:19,379
Whatever Don't know. The big the big press on the steam roller is And, you know, at this point, he's figured it out. He's he knows what's funny. He's strong. He is super strong. And and I love his first

251
00:23:20,036 --> 00:23:26,436
deliberate act, Ryan, Do you mind telling us what he does to to kind of, you know, wear in his powers

252
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:30,897
he he, like, rework the steam roller in some way.

253
00:23:31,774 --> 00:23:37,633
It's hard for me to tell what all is going on, but he he takes the kind of cylindrical tank on the top and makes it round,

254
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:45,585
and then he takes the the round kind of press on the front and on the rear and makes them square so that they're not wheels anymore.

255
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,899
He plants a pot of flowers.

256
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:50,299
And then

257
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,620
he adds

258
00:23:52,080 --> 00:24:25,060
like a seat right there. That was not there before. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. There's Al there's like, Al seat with a steering wheel in the back now with with new handles and everything up in the back. He's completely reconfigured the entire thing. And I I can't tell what the brown kind of twisty thing is that's going around from underneath and around we. Right. It's, like braid or something. And it's... And it's totally pointless and tokyo. It looks like maybe tree branches or something twisted together. I'm not sure what that is. But my favorite part is his thought to himself. That steam roller operator is going to be mildly surprised at my first job he thinks.

259
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:32,174
Actually I laughed out loud at that one because that was pretty good. I imagine the Steam roller operator coming out like

260
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:33,429
It's interesting.

261
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:37,349
Getting on and resuming his steam rolling with his

262
00:24:37,729 --> 00:24:38,549
square steam.

263
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:45,044
And and then the best part is on the next page, He just thinks better of it. He reconsider,

264
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:49,344
and and he reverts it back as though nothing happened.

265
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:55,441
And, you know, he's he can fly at this point. We got the slam bam

266
00:24:56,017 --> 00:24:56,517
introduction

267
00:24:56,894 --> 00:24:58,152
to his superpower

268
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:05,950
And and I've been having a lot of fun with this story and and chuck at it, but I love this page. This page as

269
00:25:06,447 --> 00:25:08,559
just a presentation of his powers,

270
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,879
you know, where we must be halfway through it

271
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:19,214
at this point. So this story is happening at a break neck pace, but the art on this page as a a showcase

272
00:25:19,754 --> 00:25:20,614
for what these

273
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:24,434
isotopes can let him do is is just stunning.

274
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:28,027
You know, he flies leaving the steam role in the distance.

275
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:30,704
You wanna tell us about the next panel?

276
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:33,861
So he just smash us through Brick wall

277
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,829
I guess just to show that he can. Yeah.

278
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:40,936
Then he takes a bite out of a steel gi

279
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,105
from, I guess, some kind of skyscraper that's under construction.

280
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:48,891
I have to say if I had those powers that would not have occurred to me to attempt.

281
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:50,008
Right.

282
00:25:50,865 --> 00:26:04,240
He zooms under the ground, like a jet propelled gop, which seems very... Bugs bunny is certainly already doing that by this point in history. Right? Oh, yeah. He must have been taking a a wrong turn at Albuquerque at this at this point. Exactly.

283
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:11,019
And then blow down whole forest with his breath just as Super super was doing with armies at the beginning. That's been the actual issue. Yeah.

284
00:26:11,794 --> 00:26:12,855
Some cow is

285
00:26:13,195 --> 00:26:25,097
displeased at this development. Yeah. But And then he runs he runs faster than the speed of light, and and we're made to believe that he's he's probably gone somewhere in the American Southwest because he passes a cactus

286
00:26:25,914 --> 00:26:27,490
with a a very funny on

287
00:26:27,947 --> 00:26:47,455
in in English, It's at least written as z And and, you know, by the end of the page, he's noted that no one has been able to see his great feat here. And he wants to keep it, you know, private. While he kind figures out what he can do. And and, Ryan, I just... I love this page in the next couple of pages that follows because this is like, so

288
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:50,495
I think accurate to what a real person

289
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:56,955
would do. I mean, maybe not maybe not biting the skyscraper or like, it's sponge cake, but, like,

290
00:26:57,807 --> 00:26:59,025
so many of the comics

291
00:26:59,362 --> 00:27:16,720
depict them as, like, figuring out how to immediately harness their powers for good. I feel like at least a lot of the older ones. But you know, a real person would probably just mess around for a long time seen what the heck they could do. Yeah.

292
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,120
I feel like

293
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,775
there's an example on on my mind, but I can't think of it now before they just mess around

294
00:27:23,472 --> 00:27:29,552
I mean, in the in the, like, Spider movies, you know, I do think they do a job of showing him

295
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:30,907
like, having

296
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:37,541
fun. But but I I feel like so many of these origin stories don't kind of play around with that.

297
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:40,750
Let's see if I can do this. Let's see what happens when I do this.

298
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:47,065
Yeah. Yeah. The that first that first page. Again, I love that first page where he's purposefully

299
00:27:47,525 --> 00:28:00,713
exploring his powers. And then the page that follows the the stakes really get upped into, like, the cosmic scale And again, it's super over the top and and the art, I I think is just beautiful.

300
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:12,260
You know, this is some of some of the best of his art during his his golden age period because he he leaps higher than the moon He ties two comet tails together.

301
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,226
He he lifts a sunken ship from its ocean grave and he turns a mountain

302
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:20,502
inside out

303
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:25,825
exploring the the hidden vein of gold inside. And can you take us home on this page?

304
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:34,500
And then give the right of way to nothing that swims runs our flies. He seems to be head butting and eagle. Yeah.

305
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:36,615
Who is coming the opposite direction,

306
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:41,475
the eagle know now to just get out of the way of any Ducktales wearing caps.

307
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:44,504
Coming coming us opposite way. And

308
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:50,291
so... Yeah. He decides to float home and surprise the kids and then suddenly loses his powers

309
00:28:50,725 --> 00:28:57,565
falls helpless to the ground and and plop onto the ground. Right. And and on the next page, there any other comments for this one?

310
00:28:59,045 --> 00:28:59,405
Of course,

311
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,280
anyone who

312
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:08,000
knows about astronomy, you know, comet tails are just kind of a collection of dust particles and

313
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:09,534
and gases

314
00:29:10,592 --> 00:29:13,130
and they cannot physically be tied together.

315
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:14,049
So

316
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:20,786
I think this comic is not very plausible in real life Barks. I I think that just makes it even more impressive trick.

317
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:21,804
Okay.

318
00:29:22,857 --> 00:29:23,357
Oh.

319
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:31,272
So on the next page, you know, he's he's puzzling. He's landed in his own yard, and he's puzzling over what's gone wrong. And he's kinda,

320
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:47,605
you know, searching his memory, and he realizes oh, it's that medicine. It's that funny tasting stuff in the bottle. So he he races back for it. He gu it down again. And then we transition to the Nephews who are just getting home and they're kind of

321
00:29:48,025 --> 00:29:58,300
kinda rehash the day and and how how silly it was that Un donald seems to have believed that they believe in the superhero stories.

322
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,115
And and they're, you know, acknowledging that they know it's possible.

323
00:30:02,615 --> 00:30:05,215
No kid is that dumb to think it's real.

324
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:14,563
It's a nice setup for what's about to happen. And and I think it's also maybe an acknowledgment Barks that, you know, these aren't my favorite medium, but but they're harmless.

325
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:43,540
These are just kids having fun reading. And the nephews when they get home, they're greeted with Donald. And do you mind just reading verbatim what he how he greet them. High kids. Meet super snoop. The mightiest mortal that ever tried the assad. This is how he's speaking. Certainly. Sn sn. Wait. Tell me the biggest thing super snoop ever did, and I allowed do it. Yeah. And and nephews are are immediately like, u, what's what's wrong with donald. They they assume he's feeling poorly and

326
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,660
So so Donald,

327
00:30:46,520 --> 00:31:05,269
you know, he he gets them to say, one of the feat that Super Snoop could do is that he could they tell him he could bust through walls like their tissue paper, and he says that's that's sis stuff, you know, kind of an outdated a little insult there, but he he runs straight for the wall and he collide

328
00:31:05,726 --> 00:31:07,103
with a great artistic

329
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:41,419
sp. And he's not days. He's asking, he he he doesn't know what day it is. He doesn't know where he is. And we we just transitioned to the nephews letting him recoup brad on the couch. She telling each other that, you know, he's not silly. He doesn't remember a thing since last Tuesday. And so they're kind of figuring out that they must have they must have been a bad influence he must have seen their super snoop comics and they decide that, you know, they can't trust him with the comics around, and kids should know better than to leave fantastic stories

330
00:31:41,796 --> 00:32:01,862
lying around with our parents can read that. And the last panel, the stain is that he chuck the comic right into the trash. So I mean, I think that's just a great a great little etch sketch ending to explain how Tunnel not gonna remember this, how the story is gonna end. I I love this. This is one of my favorite ten pager

331
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:10,308
Thoughts on the last page thoughts on the story overall Ryan? Yeah. I think it was interesting after all of the super cosmic things that he did,

332
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:16,861
The feet that the demand of him is, like something that real life For Could probably do, you know? Just.

333
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:25,675
And I thought oh, that's kind of a small ask, you know, from from someone who who just jumped over the moon or whatever he did. So

334
00:32:26,415 --> 00:32:34,108
ironically, if they had said, leave earth's atmosphere by jumping, you know, he he probably would not have been hurt. He would have just jumped to another sidewalk.

335
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:42,775
And they're like, oh, that's odd. You know? Would've have told them I swear. I was doing all these crazy things earlier. You should find the little girl who saw me lift up the steam with one finger.

336
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:55,614
She's the only witness to anything in this whole story and I like that she was really at that little age that that age that no one would even believe her. Right? Because she like about three or four, maybe five Yeah.

337
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:56,810
So

338
00:32:57,506 --> 00:33:02,152
I I like this story a lot. I laughed out loud at multiple points, including the

339
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:15,445
the twist ending where comics are bad influence on adults and Yeah we need to throw them away so they don't do stupid things. I thought, you know, a lot of people try to do parodies of kind of classic superhero stories and

340
00:33:15,905 --> 00:33:17,405
most of them are terrible.

341
00:33:20,305 --> 00:33:25,860
Because they don't really get it. Or or there they just know, like, one thing about superman or something, and

342
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:56,541
this was actually a really good kind of send up of the of the genre at least at this time period. Yeah. I I feel like I feel like for someone who is very annoyed by the Superhero comics that Carl Barks actually really got them. Yes. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Know and when and he even got, you know, you even have the nephew saying, you know, we know that there are not are not really people like this. We just like reading about these married suit types who can do anything and conquering evil and everything. Right. Yeah. I think it would have been interesting to see

343
00:33:56,998 --> 00:33:59,229
maybe to see his take on one who knows.

344
00:33:59,608 --> 00:34:11,129
But, yeah. I I think in the end, it feels like kind of a gentle send up. Right? Because, like, it it really just is he's annoyed by them. You know, he doesn't like that they out his comics,

345
00:34:11,688 --> 00:34:15,800
but I don't think he actually beg grudges kids reading them at all.

346
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:22,535
Yeah. Yeah. What do you how do you think this stands up compared to other superhero origin stories? Did this remind you of any on

347
00:34:23,035 --> 00:34:24,775
reminded me of almost all of them.

348
00:34:25,635 --> 00:34:28,395
The the like the like, here's some liquid isotopes.

349
00:34:28,835 --> 00:34:29,335
Okay.

350
00:34:30,848 --> 00:34:37,950
But this is actually more realistic than whatever vita arrays are, which is what they shot captain America with that's right.

351
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,902
And the Hulk coup is just

352
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:42,700
beamed with the kind of

353
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:51,445
raise that would instantly kill a man. Yes. Yeah. The kind of thing that that are shot out by black holes in space and if any of them struck earth,

354
00:34:52,204 --> 00:34:54,502
Earth would be completely sterile forever.

355
00:34:55,814 --> 00:35:06,468
But... Yeah, all of these kinds of stories of, you know, I was hit by a meteor or I found some ancient artifacts or I you know, I got a an alien

356
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:09,146
ring or I find out that I am an alien.

357
00:35:09,605 --> 00:35:10,984
The the idea of

358
00:35:11,363 --> 00:35:13,901
kind of the modern day where someone's gotten some

359
00:35:14,772 --> 00:35:27,964
surgery or there's some kind of anything that's a little more scientifically plausible is very very new. Know in the old days in the old days they just kind of used long words, and they're like, these long words gave these people powers.

360
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:31,253
Yeah. They don't they didn't really bother

361
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:37,580
going too deep into the origins back then. Because because as you said, they were really throwing these superheroes

362
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:46,021
against the wall just to see what would stick. Yeah. And and, you know what? If you're if you're forty years old and and it's nineteen forty nine,

363
00:35:46,555 --> 00:35:56,182
and you want talk about atomic science, you didn't learn anything about that in earth science or high school chemistry like we did. Nobody knew that except Albert einstein back then.

364
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:03,613
Yeah. So Very you. It's it's it's kind of... I mean, it's basically magic. You know, if you're if you're an adult at this period, Yeah. Absolutely.

365
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:10,735
So so I love this one. This is definitely like if if you ask me to to recall one of his ten pager,

366
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,180
This is definitely one of my favorites.

367
00:36:13,698 --> 00:36:22,749
And the the community as a whole definitely agrees because this one is for for one of the ten pages very well regarded. You know, this one has...

368
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:31,712
This one has a seven point six out of ten on index, which is good for two and thirty ninth out of all forty one thousand some

369
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:48,790
Disney comics. That are that are ranked. And and, you know, that doesn't sound too high, but really, there's some inflation with the the adventure stories compared to the ten pager like the they just they stand out more in people's memories. There are a fewer of them. So they're overall rated a lot higher.

370
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,730
But if you look at his ten pager,

371
00:36:51,144 --> 00:36:57,885
I I haven't, like, tallied them all up, but this this is roughly his tenth or or fifteenth or so.

372
00:36:58,538 --> 00:37:06,425
Best regarded of his ten page short stories. So very well remembered, this one was well remembered enough that Don Rosa

373
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,265
later on,

374
00:37:08,565 --> 00:37:11,145
we'll make an adventure length sequel

375
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:12,485
to this story.

376
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:16,632
Where he he goes through basically the same experience.

377
00:37:17,848 --> 00:37:22,034
They they he kinda replace the story beat for beat. It's

378
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:27,578
it's a pretty good one. It's a solid sequel. It's not one of my favorite rosa stories, but he

379
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:32,540
he plays around a little bit more. You you can tell that Don Rosa is also

380
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,980
very annoyed at the...

381
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:46,946
At the popularity of superhero comics. And I mean, I I think rightly so in a way because he was, like publishing in the very early nineties, which was kind of the dark ages for superhero comics.

382
00:37:47,359 --> 00:38:32,090
Yeah. So I think to be to be routinely out sold at least in the United States by by some of the direct and junk that was hung out. And I say this is someone who read and enjoyed superhero comics in addition to these at that at that point. But... Well, if if if Don Rosa wanted to sell some comics in the early nineties, his ducks needed to have more pouches and more belts with buckles on them. Just around their thighs and just all over their bodies for no discernible reason. That's that's what is awesome, Mark. Yeah. What what's that guy's name? Who is that dude? Is that I'm I'm thinking of like rob Life elves probably. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Thank goodness, missy he didn't. So, yeah. This one this one's well remembered, Rosa made the Sequel.

383
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:36,833
I think it holds up great. I think there's a lot of fun. If so...

384
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:43,945
Any final thoughts? Any anything else you wouldn't say about this fun ten page or ryan? Think it makes sense that the

385
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,296
twenty five or thirty page ones

386
00:38:46,752 --> 00:38:55,289
get higher ratings because you get more space to kind of raise the stakes and kind of develop what's going on and maybe some more peril for the heroes

387
00:38:55,668 --> 00:39:00,220
and more kind of conflicts for them to have to figure out how to solve.

388
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,540
And so, you know, this one you pretty much

389
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:34,248
introduced the the weird thing that's going on kind of soaking it for a couple pages and then and then resolve it quickly with the the gag at the end and and just kind of gotta get in and out. And I think for the amount of space, it's it's very good. Yeah. I I totally agree. Thanks. Thanks for saying that. Because that that's worth worth highlighting for this one. You know, it's it's such a tight story, and it just... It just gets in and it gets out. Doesn't overstate it's welcome. He he could certainly have punched this one up into an adventure length story, but

390
00:39:34,585 --> 00:39:37,715
it's so tight and it Barks so well. I'm I'm glad.

391
00:39:38,052 --> 00:39:50,155
I think this this is pretty close to a perfect ten pager to me. Awesome. Well, thanks again. As always for joining. I I really appreciate it. I'm having fun doing a handful of these ten pager and

392
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,046
we'll We'll hope to see you again soon.

393
00:39:53,702 --> 00:40:03,048
Give us drop us the line. If you have any comments about super snoop Barks remarks at g dot com. We're on the Facebook page. Awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you.
