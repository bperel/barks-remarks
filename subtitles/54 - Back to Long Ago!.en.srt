00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,495
We can have

2
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:37,825
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer an artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comments of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological

00:00:38,163 --> 00:01:02,125
publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever a grown man who's still loves Inducks comics. I love talking about these great adventure stories, and I really enjoy meeting people and getting to actually

4
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:16,981
actually chat about Disney comics. Which I... Which I never got to do growing up and reading them in isolation. And today, I have a brand new guest host with me, and he's got his own Youtube series. Where he talks about comic books

5
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:40,955
and duck and other pop culture, So I'm gonna introduce him by his Youtube handle. I am delighted to be joined by Bucket Think tank. How about a bucket? Did I... Did I introduce your Youtube channel okay? How would how do you describe it? I would probably describe it as another grown man who also I really had no one to talk to about this. And

6
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:49,260
just likes to talk about likes to share what's going on here, and he's very particular about what he does, which means it's kind of bad to some extent.

7
00:01:50,074 --> 00:02:00,860
But... Yeah. Yeah. I I talk about primarily, don't who when it's... It's fund... Disney is always fine Did... Disney world series who what talked about disney it princess,

8
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,980
the Ducktales lower video, which I did response to twenty seventeen,

9
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,080
Ducktales,

10
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:30,395
which I... My greatest crime of that was... Well, two things. When I did the life was Scrooge series of I didn't use a lot of roses actual Art by mistake that was not intentional. U. And then I did the the Ducktales Lower on Scrooge. I post it not knowing. It was down Rosa birthday, and it was... I posted it to the donald rosa not like, what do you think of this? I didn't realize it was his birthday. And downloads is not a fan of duck.

11
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:47,019
So I'll I really stepped in it that time. But for the most part, you got it. Right? I'm just a guy who when he likes something he wants share with people... Doesn't like something he wants to share with people. And, you know, wants to really show off to some extent, show off. To some extent they has an idea or two. Absolutely.

12
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:56,065
It it it's it's great. I love... I love being a grown man on the Internet who, you know, has this way of connecting with people

13
00:02:56,405 --> 00:04:00,007
in my very, like, very particular very specific nerdy interests and just getting to talk to other people about it and share my thoughts and and finding, hey, there are actually people who are who are interested in listening to those thoughts. It's it's a lot of fun. And I think bucket, what's gonna be really fun. Oh, just just again, you know, we'll we'll do a plug at the end, but definitely check him out on you You can get there pretty easily right by by plugging in your handle bucket tank. Right? Yes. Yes. It's it's a very out there name which has its own very not interesting it the stories to it. Used to wear a bucket hat a lot. Yeah. And there was a car game that I used to play called Car Vanguard hated of the game actually. It was a very horribly on unbalanced game for me, but one I think the lock was the Oracle thing tank. Group four. I like okay let's just sort of put those together the bucket hat. And the phrase tank, which always sounds really contentious and really smart. Let's do that and I stuck. I really like the name. I I think it's nice and sticky. So I think it's... I think it's a good choice. But but I'm gonna be going by bucket with with your approval for the That's for the recording. And

14
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:09,810
bucket, today we get to talk about a pretty interesting and and pretty weird, frankly Carl Barks uncle Scrooge and Donald duct venture,

15
00:04:10,248 --> 00:04:12,798
recovering back too long ago.

16
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:34,800
This this a really cookie story. I've gotta to say right off the bat. Like, I I think I think this is a perfectly fine story. This is a pretty enjoyable one. It's not like one of my favorites, but but I think it's gonna make for a really good podcast conversation just because of some of the background of it and and how deeply weird this one is. Yeah. Yeah. It is

17
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:57,285
It's a story that I don't think you would look to for, like a a recommendation. Because when you wanna recommend something to someone, you wanna get one that just grabs this is one of those where after you've read a couple, you're like, okay, this is a this is a fun story. This this is one that you automatically go to. Of like, more like a comfort story, but it's one of those it gets the job done. Like, you know what? This is fine. This is fine. This is funny in some ways.

18
00:04:57,859 --> 00:04:59,716
This is engineering, it has...

19
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:39,729
There's nothing about it it stands out, but it's never bad. Yeah. I I think you nailed it there. I think that's a great way to to describe it because you're right. You wouldn't you wouldn't wanna read this necessarily as one of your first spark stories. I don't think it's likely to grab you maybe someone out there, you know, every story I found is someone's favorite out there, you know. And some... For someone this was probably their inter introduction but you're right. I don't think you would tell someone. Oh, you've gotta get into Carl Barks This is just the story for it. First off, you know, it's It's pretty weird. It's a little bit deep into it. That is kinda how I read it too. You know? I I read I started reading Barks in the late eighties,

20
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,163
blade eighties with the Gladstone printing.

21
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:52,383
And I didn't see this one until Disney comic Scott around to it, and I think nineteen ninety three or so. They reprint. It was a really cool rosa cover.

22
00:05:52,722 --> 00:06:10,553
And and I I liked the story pretty well. I remember, I I re reread it relatively frequently. It was not one of my like ones that I re reread all the time, but but even even the first time I read it, I remember thinking boy. This is pretty strange this tail of past lives

23
00:06:10,931 --> 00:06:11,330
regression.

24
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:21,160
Yeah. I remember when I used to go to the com store my grandmother to try to find it because she was the one that would take me to all these different common Barks bookstores to find like

25
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:28,680
Scrooge squeeze adventures economics because that's the ones that I would that I would find. Right. I remember something when I saw, like, the Paul bun machine and

26
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:46,453
how the Wi mills. I would often see Barks long ago, I would just see what looked like Scrooge and Donald, like, you know, holding so again. I'm my, this looks really cool. I'm like, I kinda... I kinda wanna see this. And it turns out that's not really... This more that's sort just the cover, which is always the great moment. The cover should just be the hook

27
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:56,325
You should never go the covers exactly what the story is. No. That's that's Severino fuck. Yeah. I agree. It's nice one the cover just really like does a good job of hinting at the story.

28
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:59,236
It's it's kind of one of my pet peeve

29
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:03,311
is when the cover are, like really reviews.

30
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:17,585
Something. At the same time, I don't like the... If if we think about the original printing of this, which I'm gonna go ahead and just mentioned, let... Let's start talking about the original printing. It it was published Inducks uncle Scrooge sixteen,

31
00:07:18,282 --> 00:07:24,124
and it had one of those Carl Barks gag covers that he got to do for most of the the stories.

32
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:33,664
I like it when, you know, back to the deck. It gives you a really good idea of some of the meat of the story, same thing when home only a poor man.

33
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:35,960
But without really spoiling it,

34
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:43,145
So so the publication was in cover date of October nineteen fifty six.

35
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:52,700
This one has been reprinted kind of an average number of times. In in the states it's had eleven printing, including the original

36
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:54,751
Bucket, this is a relatively

37
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:55,708
short

38
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:58,500
adventure story. It's twenty one pages.

39
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:07,620
And and I think it it doesn't necessarily feel like a rush story or anything to me. But but it's definitely... Not as long as it's, like thirty two pages.

40
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:27,330
Yeah. He had a very clear idea of the story Huey, wanted to tell. There's not a lot of twists and turn still. It's mostly straight line with maybe one hurdle. It's two different characters and this in this instance where it Scrooge down on opposite ends reaching to the same goal. So that's really where most of the padding happens. And Mark's one of them arrived there at the same time.

41
00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:37,479
Right. So that was really the the one unquote hurdle there. And as you you just hinted, you know, the dynamic of this story is that it's a Scrooge versus

42
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:40,915
Donald story. This is this is one of those

43
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:55,988
occasional. They're not like rare, but they they certainly don't happen all the time. Stories where the Ducktales not c cooperating they're actually competing against each other. Barks likes to do this every once in a while. It kind of kinda har back to the old Disney cartoons that use to work on.

44
00:08:56,365 --> 00:09:09,688
You know what? You know what? Thought just crossed my mind bucket. As I hold up my my reprint of the Disney comic that Rose did the cover for This might be one of the very rare bits of cover art that technically doesn't feature

45
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:12,045
any of the Disney main characters

46
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:19,039
because we're we're looking at the... On this cover from uncle screws number two seventy nine, we're looking at the

47
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:28,578
request to the long ago. Characters that they're gonna travel pack in time. To inhabit Donald as what Boston pin tail and

48
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:31,545
Scrooge as medium Inducks.

49
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:31,843
Yes.

50
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,339
I remember seeing

51
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:49,817
these two before and that they would like the big. This was one comic as kid. I was like, I had to find this comment just because it went was squash buck pirates. I signed me up for navy Inducks I don't... I'd seen him in Don Rosa life and times of Inducks

52
00:09:50,694 --> 00:09:56,594
run And I had... And then he's on the doc Family tree along with Pi. Is may

53
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:05,720
Malcolm maybe Inducks. And he's his story is hilarious in the context that is provided here. And it's even better when you go to Roses

54
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:14,895
Scrooge series and it's part five. It's it's it's hilarious. The back and forth there. Right, because because Don Rose is really gonna run with the cara Pearson.

55
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:19,775
As he does, he he just... He picks out some of the details that Barks used

56
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,927
and he uses them for his, you know,

57
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:27,040
story in in an interesting way. So here's that I in a to bucket.

58
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,744
Before we actually launch into the story,

59
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:40,980
I we gotta take a moment to talk about the the weird hook. Of this one. Right? Which is it's something called past lives regression.

60
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,355
In in this story, Scrooge and Donald sep are both gonna visit hit,

61
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:49,275
who

62
00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:51,330
put their patients into

63
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:54,498
I'm I'm gonna use scare quotes around patients.

64
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:57,709
Put there patience into a deep trans

65
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,989
through diagnosis and they talk to them about their experiences

66
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:09,545
in their past lives as separate people. Right? So we're talking like same soul, different body.

67
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:19,664
And and the hope for this is that, you know, this is gonna be a fad and duck where a lot of people are gonna end up discovering riches that they're past selves

68
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:34,672
have, you know, would have known about. But bucket, do you know anything about kind of the real history behind this? Honestly, I I don't, but it did sound interesting. I knew it felt like this was a thing that did happen. And if you look at other cartoons,

69
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:36,323
for of the time,

70
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,794
like came on the nineties Hi was everywhere.

71
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:56,480
Fred Flint stone got one point, elmer overflow was ties to think that he was a rabbit at one point and then... Right. Only recently got him hepatitis that he was out referred. Hip was always been a really fun idea It's always been fun. I think this just felt so natural and idea. Yeah. You're you're right.

72
00:11:57,319 --> 00:12:04,387
Is is a very common trope in cartoons and comics ever since, like I I guess Floyd kinda popularized it

73
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:16,547
but but this, like, very specific branch of it, the repressed memories. I think that's a little less common, although definitely, there are instances of this and pop culture. But... And and rein,

74
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:23,952
right, that's like an an age old idea that appears in a lot of world religions that's in that's in hi.

75
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:40,332
That's in I I looked it up and and even old ancient and Greek philosophers, like socrates keys and play top played talked about it. So, you know, there's There's nothing new about that. But what what did happen in the twentieth century is that hit

76
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:42,743
Al a way to, like, support

77
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:45,373
to Delve into people's, like memories

78
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,888
became more popularized.

79
00:12:47,424 --> 00:12:58,102
And and this is crazy. I looked to this up that keep and people have done like whole podcasts about this specific case. But there there is a very specific incident in the fifties

80
00:12:58,454 --> 00:12:59,752
that almost certainly

81
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:00,848
informed Barks,

82
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,661
you know, creation of this story.

83
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:05,590
And it

84
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:08,720
It's the story of a woman.

85
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:14,125
And her past life, the woman's name her real name was

86
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:15,201
Virginia

87
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:31,195
ti or tai. I'm not sure how to pronounce that. But it's it's the story of bride Murphy. And this was first told in a series of articles by William J Baker and published in the Denver post in nineteen fifty four. Right? So we're looking at just

88
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:35,480
just a couple years prior in early fifty six,

89
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:37,654
there was a book released

90
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:40,938
called the search for B Murphy And and basically,

91
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:47,682
what it happened was in nineteen fifty two, this amateur hit test named Mori Bernstein

92
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:49,454
put this housewife

93
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,852
Virginia Tai

94
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,567
from Colorado inn a That sparked off this

95
00:13:54,906 --> 00:13:55,406
revelation

96
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,331
that she had about her past life as a nineteenth

97
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:01,409
century

98
00:14:01,947 --> 00:14:05,241
as a nineteenth Century Irish woman and

99
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:07,149
and it it became this, like,

100
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:08,486
sensational

101
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:11,714
thing that was, you know, very widespread

102
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:13,525
in and popular media.

103
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:19,344
There was a lot of interest in it. People would have these, like, come as you were parties

104
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:23,470
dressing as you as you were in one of your past lives,

105
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:33,760
The book was really popular. There was a movie option for it. I think they did make it the woman, she was always skeptical about it and she kinda wanted to stay anonymous.

106
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:44,011
She had a pseudo him for a while. But eventually, like, you know, as these things do, it it basically totally fell apart when people, like, looked up the details,

107
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:52,813
you know, because, like, she... She had all these specific details. Some of them hand out and she spoke with an Irish accent even though she wasn't really.

108
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:55,448
And basically, they figured out

109
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:58,083
sorry. I'm getting keyed up because this is really interesting.

110
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:03,163
They they figured out that it it was a case of something

111
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,120
called

112
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:08,005
Instead of amnesia, it's the case of crypto n.

113
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,200
Where you like are able to recover real memories from your childhood

114
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,880
that you have basically

115
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,162
forgotten So apparently, even though she was like raised by Norwegian, American Parents,

116
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:22,953
she had these, like, Al Ant uncle

117
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,708
who were from Ireland.

118
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,520
And there was, like, a neighbor when she was three that was named bride Murphy.

119
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:48,710
And and, you know, so she must have been hearing Irish the cyrus accent and and it all... It all just kinda fell apart in that way. But it it didn't fall apart quick enough for this to really take off and and just to become a very popular thing that people that really

120
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,561
people. So, you know, like the most of the country Bark read the paper. He almost certainly

121
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:08,782
encountered this and other similar stories that were really in v. During during that spam. It it is a fun idea the more you think about. And in regards to her, like, it shows exactly with the power of consciousness

122
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:26,351
and the mind and what these things, what you can really dig up and how it can affect who you on how you've developed. And in terms of wanting to find out that, hey, maybe the life you're living now is just part two. Of this way moisture life this is a cool down period. And right like, you know, you made have that a pirate

123
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:28,997
or, you know, March with Washington,

124
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:44,945
you know, it's always a really fun idea. It's it's really tempting to explore that aspect. It's also just fun. I could see like it... Again but Al like, hey, at this point, you were... Actually, you were actually just a sheep dealer. You're still sheep. I'm sorry. That you piqued... This is actually your best life. I'm sorry.

125
00:16:46,225 --> 00:16:48,965
I know. Because because everyone was like Maria

126
00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:57,976
Antoinette or or Ne Td or something and they're supposed past lives instead of, like like you say a swine her

127
00:16:58,914 --> 00:17:01,950
or a a surf in in Sa Russia.

128
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,893
Someone definitely at this point, things. They have Al loss duchess anastasia.

129
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:09,019
Like, it's it's me, I promise it's me.

130
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:19,035
Right. Yeah. I I think you nailed why why this is so popular or why this is such an inviting and tempting idea. And I don't think the Barks

131
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:23,475
necessarily bought into it, but I think he definitely saw the potential

132
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:33,840
of of this making a good story and because he had to write so many of these. But as you say, Hip, it's not the first time. He's going back to that well. Because

133
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:39,163
he's used he is... Even at this point, there's been a number of stories that feature hit,

134
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:46,066
probably most famously adventure down under. That one gets started off by a really funny

135
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:48,632
experienced donald has with with the hit.

136
00:17:49,248 --> 00:18:02,736
And then there's another memorable one in the the Christmas story, you can't guess. As well as several ten pager, probably one of his most famous ten pages is the hip pit gun or the the Bin you're.

137
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:03,690
Story.

138
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,130
That's a great one to check out. Mh.

139
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:15,956
Alright. So Al lot lot a good background for this one bucket. We're gonna launch into the story soon. But before we do, I do like to check in with,

140
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:20,445
you know, some of the titles from around the world and to the international listeners.

141
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:27,800
Who can listen to us, try to wrap our wrap our tons around different, the stories, titles and different languages.

142
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:33,215
So yeah. It's it's a good time. So here's the thing. A lot of these stories,

143
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:57,605
they have a a title that doesn't translate nicely. And then some of the stories they just basically translate it word for word. This this is for the most part one of those that's not too interesting. But I did give you one title that that to me sounds Al little more interesting than the other. So I'm in a rattle off a few of them, and then I'll let you do that Italian one. But... Okay. So

144
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:01,880
Denmark in Danish, this one is just translated as back to the past.

145
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:04,710
Teal bag, teal ford

146
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:06,545
in finish.

147
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:11,827
I don't I don't usually do the finish because that's the hardest one for me. I'm gonna try it. Mat

148
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:13,183
Mend

149
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:15,178
Yu

150
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:17,590
is a trip to the past.

151
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,982
And then in German, now let's go with French.

152
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:24,219
In French, it's either tres,

153
00:19:25,836 --> 00:19:27,016
temporal treasure

154
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:34,972
or v donald don't voyage and time or just time travel. So not There those are all fine. Pretty straightforward

155
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:42,226
They they did make an interesting choice for the Italian though. What's that one? They did they did... So when telling you, it's Severino,

156
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,240
Al Ducktales,

157
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:55,695
which translates to uncle Scrooge and the Queen's treasure, which really echo echoes nothing. About what's gonna happen almost feels was like, it could be any other story. Yeah. Which is which is fine. Sounds really exciting.

158
00:19:56,375 --> 00:20:06,942
Either way. Yeah. I thought it was an odd choice. I don't think any of them quite have the connotation that you get in English. Right? With back to long ago because just long ago sounds

159
00:20:07,478 --> 00:20:10,331
more for voting than the past.

160
00:20:11,147 --> 00:20:24,421
Alright. So we're gonna go ahead and and plow into this story. Alright. Buckets. So back to long ago opens up, We get one of our very common opening for the Scrooge adventure where

161
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:30,380
he is in. He's in his bin or at least Huey, in a room Adjacent. It's signaled to us

162
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:43,405
how Rich he is because he's sitting on a giant money bag and it's full of money. There's a great site ga that his his candle is resting on ledger labeled bills, bills, two, more bills,

163
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:57,413
also more yet. I like that. And and what he's doing is he's pouring through his his accounts his ledger and he discovers that there is a tenant in one of his office buildings that hasn't paid his rent for three months.

164
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:04,196
So because Scrooge is very hands on person, he's gonna go right over

165
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,049
and throw him out.

166
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:11,123
And he's it's it's it's an engaging opening. He's striving forth

167
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:16,690
glaring at the note and figuring out the calculating that he owes me ninety dollars

168
00:21:17,187 --> 00:21:33,528
pondering suppose all of my tenants stopped paying their rent in two thousand years had be broke. And as he gets up to the tenant office, he he notes that the guy's name is Me J spell castor. H p d h,

169
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:36,600
says you should add a D to those initials

170
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:38,055
for dead beads.

171
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:44,090
That really cracks me up. And the page closes with him just in mid sentence.

172
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,790
Okay. Hp d h d b shell out or get out.

173
00:21:48,563 --> 00:22:12,976
And and the he launch into his tail of woe and what a hard time he's had. What do you think bucket? I I like this opening. I think it's pretty strong. I do. I first of all, opening up in the money that has always been one of my favorite things. The all money that. I remember here Barks talking about you know, he would always show how Scrooge screws was, but you know, he put money in one room or like money on the jazz. You do it more and more and more. So like you know, there's a lot of money.

174
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:47,390
The the... One thing I don't like about that opening scene is just the bag he's sitting on. It looks like a little too big is kinda distracting, but I still love the energy here. It was... Was one of my favorite parts of the sunken city, you know, he's going over his ledger and it looks so serious. And then hear this, like, what the amount is, like you... Know. And I love that he is like, you know what? I will deal with this myself. Like, Right comes to people owing him money despite the fact that he wants a world empire. This is something he has to begin with himself. And you can see that in the invader Fort Inducks

175
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,070
when they talk about how Scrooge bought fort duck,

176
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:57,650
Kill mu Hill, and the Junior wichita to still hold up there huge like running out dead is one of my favorite things.

177
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:12,393
So this is kind of it too, but also the absurdity of the fact that, you know, this guy who's him ninety dollars. And picked the most extreme with you know, if all of my tenants stop paying in two thousand years I'd be broke. Which is just hell hilarious is the how rich you have to be. Exactly.

178
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:13,252
That.

179
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,525
And you mentioned Secret of. This does

180
00:23:16,903 --> 00:23:21,809
evo that opening where he's gonna approach donald for Al even more try amount.

181
00:23:22,227 --> 00:23:26,359
And that story you mentioned, of course is one of the chapters in Roses

182
00:23:27,814 --> 00:23:28,293
adaptation.

183
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:36,392
These stories. Alright. So I I like the back and forth between him and the hit. Scrooge just has no sympathy

184
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:45,154
for his b. The guy is is a explaining to him that he that he's a hit test, and the business has been overcrowded

185
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:49,625
lately. Al like Scrooge remark, you'll find plenty of elbow room in the par.

186
00:23:50,705 --> 00:23:53,685
And and I think this kind of mirrors, you know, how

187
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,085
how I was saying

188
00:23:55,505 --> 00:23:57,345
was a big fat at this point.

189
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:09,205
He's talking about just all these people have opened up shop Scrooge references it being a rocket. But he says, no. It's not a rack mister Up. We believe we can actually

190
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:17,098
levi persons back in mind to lives they lived hundreds of years ago You know, so right away, Barks is is

191
00:24:18,037 --> 00:24:28,334
specifying what kind of cookie hit he's talking about. And and the hit makes him this offer that he it will give him some of his services

192
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:33,438
instead of paying the money. He owes. And screwed, you know, initially,

193
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,130
he has no interest in it, but the

194
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:42,690
starts to persuade him bucket, do you wanna tell us how he goes about successfully

195
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,516
persuading him? He does what a lot of good sales when do.

196
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:50,684
Automatically if he pulling out people who benefit from it. He points out to

197
00:24:51,021 --> 00:25:03,618
to mister a new rich. Mister New, like know hey look this guy, he was Peg when them. She just last month, but back in history, he found he was one of bizarre soldiers, and he spot a location of a case of

198
00:25:04,195 --> 00:25:05,271
gold like look it.

199
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:35,592
Insane, but hear me go. Al He returned to the present he flew through and honor the hood, which is part that former formalized centuries ago, and like, wait a minute it. Well that's kinda cool. And, you know, plush cake you know, whom he levi back to france of sixteenth, let you know? You know, it it's it's a great little g possibly. But we're showing actual receipts here. She found that in her and her life there, she had been made to madam du Bower, and I such she hidden a great... The great beauty jewels

200
00:25:35,945 --> 00:25:58,115
when the mom swept into Loot Her share tell. So, you know, there's some really good stuff here. To really get you like, you know, this isn't just kind of ridiculous. People are making... Make making a good profit off of this off of just sitting down and remembering. Right? Yeah Exactly right away, Barks is telling us that no. This is not a rocket. This guy, while he might be ridiculous,

201
00:25:58,489 --> 00:26:20,342
This is all real. And and this this was kinda one of the things that left a weird taste and my mouth about this story because because I'm such a skeptic and It it always... It always weird me out to see Scrooge buying into some of these, like, kinda cookie beliefs. But but it's fine. And, you know, in the Inducks Universe, this is clearly something that has been discovered

202
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,557
to be real.

203
00:26:22,235 --> 00:26:25,622
And and so Scrooge Barks to mall over the possibilities.

204
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,377
We got a great signaling,

205
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,531
you know, a money eyes

206
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:31,206
panel from him

207
00:26:31,997 --> 00:26:33,831
What does he ponder bucket?

208
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:42,798
Perhaps long ago was keep of King Solomon long lost minds, you know? Or maybe I was guard of of the treasurer owners the past that came crisis.

209
00:26:43,376 --> 00:26:47,965
Yeah Right I could be so... I could have so much more money. I could have so much more.

210
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:59,497
Maybe, maybe, I was a like secretary for the treasure the ninth temp. Like he hasn't said it. But, yeah, the scale can never be too big for food. It's never just a simple thing.

211
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:18,285
On a bit of a tangent if you look to say the Ducktales movie. When food has three wishes, he goes like four wishes in his head. The world's biggest diamond, the world's biggest time in mind. No. All the diamond minds. Know the entire mining Inducks industry. That's right. He thinks big. And I think that is a great rate that he has as a businessman,

212
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:19,345
if anything else.

213
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:26,580
Yeah. That's right. I forgotten about that line, but that just transported me back to rewatch that up over and over as.

214
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:35,506
It's interesting to note of course that both of those just little quick illusions can solomon lines that the treasure of king cr.

215
00:27:35,882 --> 00:27:43,471
So, of course, it won't be too too long before Barks is gonna make a story out of King Solomon, long lost minds.

216
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:52,320
He does never get around crisis though. I think I think Rosa will do one of those and probably any other number any number of other Ducktales creators.

217
00:27:52,658 --> 00:28:15,065
So Scrooge, you know, he sees the possibility. He's gonna take the the me, the the hit up on this offer. And as he sits down, he learns that for ninety dollars, he's gonna get nine minutes in new quote rusty pass. Which, of course, works out to be ten dollars a minute. The quote union scale for this type of hit

218
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:33,774
I like that. It's it's funny. It's it's a good bit. I'm not gonna run that through the inflation converter because I know that it's roughly ten times plus just a little bit. So we're talking about basically a hundred bucks a minute. I I can just imagine a bunch of hit to the other day like, what is? What is our set scale?

219
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:39,835
The of this, Like, you know, because on the off chance, they don't get anything, and they're not happy. We need like, a set amount.

220
00:28:40,513 --> 00:28:46,107
Alright? Because it may not work. They may not lock they're actually swan hurt or, you know, you know,

221
00:28:46,864 --> 00:28:48,657
something to make sure that we get out of this. Alright?

222
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:56,610
Right. And and Barks, that's a good... It's a cute gag, the the idea of having a union scale for something ridiculous

223
00:28:57,324 --> 00:29:06,056
you know, the help talk about the, like, b boys, having a a bang robert's union stuff like that eventually. Frequently. Alright. So the next sequence,

224
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,670
The next sequence is about putting screws into his.

225
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:18,081
And and bucket, there's no suspense about this working. You know, he he puts him under and it works

226
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,080
immediately

227
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:21,237
And immediately, he is catapult

228
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:22,810
back into the past

229
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:24,446
very conveniently

230
00:29:24,783 --> 00:29:32,273
in a robot heading to shore with a chest... What what clearly is a treasure chest? And

231
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:33,867
he is accompanied

232
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,018
by one other

233
00:29:36,554 --> 00:29:45,253
individual. And bucket, do you wanna tell us about about these two people and and their interaction and what they what they get up to. So here,

234
00:29:45,593 --> 00:29:47,971
they're just, you know, on the boat on the road robot,

235
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:54,658
Maybe Ducktales, you know, at the at the start of it, so to speak, and we have Boston Pen,

236
00:29:55,077 --> 00:29:59,105
Rowan, almost like this great universal division labor between these two characters.

237
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,420
And

238
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:02,851
he's said... Pinto asking

239
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:09,248
what was in it? It was not said what's in it and made with justice, any full can guess which from the Spanish treasure

240
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:15,316
that they dumped off trinidad Al. Okay. Okay. And the world seal is on the log. I suppose it's special

241
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:18,221
loop for Queen Ba Queen Elizabeth. Mh.

242
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:19,797
You know, And

243
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:48,071
may Inducks property like wag civil tongue, Pint tail, her majesty cactus never take loot they take war prizes, which is a fun way to say, you know, we didn't, like, steal it. It was... You know, we there was a thing for hampton. And you know, it's it's our trophy. Like, you know, fair square. And pit temple out the chest is so valuable they bed on this island whilst they weighed Westwood along the Spanish main, and the captain thinks it'll be safer here during their dangerous voyage. It's all very

244
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:48,948
straightforward

245
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:51,575
It's almost as if... As as Scrooge is...

246
00:30:52,333 --> 00:31:00,028
If like, it's... We're really sort of taken out sort of see the story happening. It's it's being told to us what's going as opposed to possibly us being,

247
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:11,100
I wanna say this could have actually just been a caption a dialogue box by the narrator. But because we've gone back in town, we have to be almost a third person. Who just woke up as Scrooge,

248
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:41,124
theoretically just woke up and made Inducks body. Yeah. Doesn't it doesn't it really feel Doesn't it have the feel of a movie flash? Yeah. It it's very effective I think... So here's an interesting thing that I'm noticing in in my reprint at least. And I think you're you're consulting what looks like one of the reproduction of the original story. Maybe you can tell me if that's the case. But it kind of sep tone the coloring. They've... The the color is has has very effectively

249
00:31:42,023 --> 00:31:44,535
kinda muddy to the colors for this

250
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:50,755
flat... I guess, flash isn't the right term. But, you know, this this jump back too long ago,

251
00:31:51,515 --> 00:31:54,626
the docs are just a little bit rare than Scrooge is.

252
00:31:55,481 --> 00:32:13,052
No they look the same really? Okay. So the original caller didn't make that choice. I I like the choice for the reprint. Hey, I got a say bucket. That that bothers pen tail He looks ever so slightly familiar to me. Clearly, he's pete from you...

253
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,105
Goofy his next door neighbor. But, you know,

254
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:18,775
But,

255
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,935
yeah. Yeah. He does. He looks like someone,

256
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,775
someone who has a very temper

257
00:32:25,155 --> 00:32:27,869
someone who... Like, even his clothes look oddly.

258
00:32:28,287 --> 00:32:28,947
Like the

259
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:39,216
of the black and the red and the blue hat. It's. I I don't know. I don't I'm sure will come up later. I have sure. Maybe not. Just

260
00:32:39,713 --> 00:32:44,540
so we're we're goof. But, like, the point is There this is glaring

261
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,580
obviously

262
00:32:46,160 --> 00:33:02,177
signaled as being donald. Right? This is this is Donald in a past life. When he wakes up Scrooge is not going to immediately realize that like the reader does. But there there is just Barks does not allow any... It's not very subtle here. It really isn't.

263
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:24,539
And it it doesn't take away anything to it. It's... Again, this story is not very complicated, and you don't really have to make a big mystery of this. But it sorta of makes sense that Scrooge wouldn't notice this because it's not really what matters. What happens here is he's taken the... He's gone back to someone who already knows who this is in that current tense. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And he's he's

264
00:33:24,997 --> 00:33:27,990
sen focused on this fantastic treasure.

265
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:43,391
So so we do proceed to them doing the classic trope of burying this treasure chest and marking the coordinates on them on a map. There's nothing too interesting about this part. I mean, it's it's neat. It's it's it's very...

266
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:54,728
It's very well detailed and and the art is really nice. It's just Al pretty straightforward thing where they the the conversation is interesting, you know, they make a pledge that in the event that,

267
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:56,883
you know, they're the only

268
00:33:57,221 --> 00:34:03,964
survivors of maybe some catastrophe and end of being the only people that know about the location of this treasure.

269
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:06,760
They're talking about what they would go on to do

270
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,836
medium doc sense is very honorable

271
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:17,290
Huey, vows to deliver it on to her majesty in person and and Bo Pint patel is a little bit more reluctant about that

272
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:26,717
But they end up the queen, they make that val and they head off for the rest of the Spanish main, and then very abruptly

273
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,242
Scrooge just nine minutes seem to have ended and he is catapult

274
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:32,279
back

275
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:35,930
back to the present. The back back to our nineteen fifty six present.

276
00:34:37,105 --> 00:34:40,005
From back to long ago to back to nine minutes later.

277
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:53,570
This has been I guess, the the h test is asking, you know, did have a nice journey and and Scrooge is just he is off to the races. He's not even gonna stop to tell the hi

278
00:34:54,004 --> 00:35:07,610
about what he's seen. He's just had this great opportunity, of course, he's gonna go treasure Hunting and recover that chest. Of gold. He braces to Tu berg planning to head to a hardware

279
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:15,094
store to not to buy a shovel bucket. But to check on the price to see if you can get a good bargain

280
00:35:15,431 --> 00:35:17,008
on a shuffle. And

281
00:35:17,664 --> 00:35:20,557
we see a very familiar silhouette of a shadow.

282
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:28,723
Around the corner, do you wanna tell us about who he encounters in their conversation? He runs into the legendary

283
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:30,380
Donald Duck.

284
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:31,394
Okay.

285
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:45,001
And what's really cool about when they when they crash and which other is? They both Pretty much to almost laps into their pass into sw labs past life. Know, we the loads and ladies saved.

286
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:48,130
And they put like donald, my bird brain nephew,

287
00:35:48,585 --> 00:36:06,261
and Don goes on the Scrooge, and what's really cool is in this quick moment here. Sm goes on new example sail I one met I wonder how to look with an fashion. And donna was like, you know what? You got a strange feel about you too Scrooge sc. I wanna if be looking with Al flu hat and wearing a cut. I would also point out that, you know,

288
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:08,894
maid mc Ducktales was wearing actual shoes,

289
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:21,231
which is always weird to me for die so. Yeah. You know, Donald like, yeah. That that's just life. And donald has no time. Like, you know what? I gotta go. We got a laundry drain make and Scrooge cease the shovel.

290
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:23,985
And yeah. This

291
00:36:24,325 --> 00:36:26,465
this is a pretty great exchange.

292
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:34,109
It's a little bit again Barks really isn't as subtle as I think I would like him to be. It's a very per

293
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:37,195
meeting. We we know exactly they're supposed to both

294
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:53,210
Donald is supposed to let it slip that he's basically had the same experience that Scrooge has. I do love the panel where they collide and their bills fold down and pressed into each other. It's a riot. That... That's a great one.

295
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,490
But

296
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:56,702
but on the, it's a pretty serviceable

297
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:21,128
sequence. It's funny because this sets the real story up. And in a lot of ways, it feels like we could've gone a slightly different route with this. Like one of them could have gone to the other about them what they've seen. But the the difference... I wanna think about Screwed and Donald is is that at times they're bigger kids than the nephews. Mh. And they're all for themselves. This is a very weird Scrooge versus downs

298
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:30,961
in my mind, because usually a versus Donald story is donald or sp each like they're smarter than the other. And the other one has to prove them wrong. But this one is just sort of

299
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,332
we could easily fix this by just talking to each other.

300
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:37,507
But no. We don't have that... That's not what this comic is about.

301
00:37:38,346 --> 00:37:50,605
So they go off. That's an excellent point. Right? This is definitely one of those situations where the lack of communication... I mean, it drives the story forward, but it can be a little a little bit frustrating.

302
00:37:51,505 --> 00:38:12,606
And I have that same thought. Right? In another Scrooge story this could very easily be okay. I'm gonna first time gonna go to the hardware store and find a bargain on shovel, and next, I'm gonna go get donald and the kids because I'll need their help. To figure out blah blah blah. But... But that's not what's what Barks wants to do here he wants to have this this opposition story.

303
00:38:13,379 --> 00:38:17,428
And so we set up the opposition by having Scrooge talk

304
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:18,624
with the nephews

305
00:38:19,002 --> 00:38:31,226
and and they don't really know what's going on. But they know just enough to flu Scrooge jin saying that Donald been acting mis mysterious ever since he came out of a hit distance office down the street just now.

306
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,318
And I like I like Scrooge

307
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:37,893
exclamation. Oh my plume hack. And he has already bought a shovel.

308
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:48,835
And and so Scrooge just thinking out loud. Donald on is the reborn, Boston Benton tail. He knows where the treasure is by having been levi into the past same as I was.

309
00:38:49,649 --> 00:38:52,024
So Scrooge sets off to a tropical

310
00:38:52,362 --> 00:38:57,052
airline ticket office planning to beat him to the islands and the nephews

311
00:38:57,484 --> 00:39:07,197
we're we're gonna transition now because it's not solely a screwed story. Mh. We're gonna transition to Donald and the kids. And and the net are gonna slow donald

312
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:09,962
down a little bit by very reasonably

313
00:39:10,418 --> 00:39:14,841
demanding an explanation of why he wants them to get their sea tags.

314
00:39:15,295 --> 00:39:16,715
Packed for example.

315
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:21,695
It's fun. It it it is... The whole thing is it's really funny yeah. The fact that

316
00:39:22,615 --> 00:39:25,770
Oh my p had, and he's already bought a shovel.

317
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:26,810
Right.

318
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:32,550
Right the bill breaker. Like he's already got the shovel. He's basically dug the treasure out now.

319
00:39:34,045 --> 00:39:44,515
So like, I can't waste any anytime. I gotta go and he we do emilio sort of like we have no idea what is going on. Let's like, look. Look on down. We love you.

320
00:39:44,852 --> 00:39:53,625
We respect you something that is... But... What's what's going on? What is going on? You talked it to a man, levi you and now we gotta get sea tags

321
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:56,745
and we're ten years old. Why do we have details?

322
00:39:57,405 --> 00:39:58,345
And they're reasonably

323
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:01,878
they're reasonably skeptical because he's just been

324
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:04,252
too. I like I like that little touch.

325
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:10,993
So, you know, we we transitioned through a narrator box where Barb talks about the explanation,

326
00:40:11,529 --> 00:40:19,505
and and the Nephews is her like, Are willing to blow your whole fortune on a trip to this island without knowing for sure the whole business wasn't a dream.

327
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:26,571
And and they make him prove prove it, basically by resting some details out of him

328
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:30,785
and they're able... They're gonna be able to confirm the the records

329
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:34,725
the name of the ship through the library records.

330
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:40,467
I like the name of the ship. It it's called the Falcon Rover and he remembers the dates,

331
00:40:40,885 --> 00:40:50,626
which was December six fifteen sixty four. So, hey, we're, you know, that's really handy. I I just realized we're gonna be

332
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,118
I'm gonna be releasing this right around

333
00:40:53,656 --> 00:40:55,954
pretty close at least to the anniversary.

334
00:40:57,611 --> 00:40:58,410
Same month the least.

335
00:40:59,663 --> 00:41:07,547
And then they're able to figure out that the islands, the island is about a days sale Northwest of Trinidad,

336
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:19,698
and an island called Lonely Island. And so the nephews leave to go do their research while Donald Paste worrying about new millions and treasurer state and the kids being practical. And the nephews

337
00:41:20,075 --> 00:41:25,120
are pretty excited when they're able to confirm those details at the library

338
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:32,284
including a passage called the last days of the Falcon Rover. Yeah. This is...

339
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:34,641
This is just a really fun sequence

340
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:42,966
altogether then once again, there are stories when he were doing little all the voices of reasons, they're the adults in the room and this is pretty intrigued

341
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:45,790
So like now, no. None of this makes any sense.

342
00:41:46,627 --> 00:41:55,525
So give us some fax here. Which is really how you would address anyone who says like, hey, I was this in the past life. Well then you should know this. So, you know, that.

343
00:41:56,025 --> 00:42:20,714
And so they get the data, and they go. You know what? Let's research this. Which really screws would have done any other time. Right But once the what's the idea of gold is in his head, he tends to just jet off without thinking, we see Donald do it. Like I said earlier, like, most days Scrooge it down to other big other kids in the and he we're dealing Louie sort of forced to grow up a bit more. Again, why do they have sea tags

344
00:42:21,173 --> 00:42:22,552
and really in school

345
00:42:23,983 --> 00:42:27,276
They have a vast amount of knowledge and desire for research.

346
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:33,400
That would not be expected if anyone there age. But this sort of like in line would say Johnny Quest.

347
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,520
They're

348
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:45,282
surprisingly brought kids. And once they get the fax, like, you know what, this actually might be fun. Let's go look a dialed. Yeah And and it's good wish fulfillment of course for the for the young readers.

349
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:46,957
I I

350
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:57,585
you're noting that it's it's a very sensible thing, right, for them to confirm this, you're absolutely right, and it's exactly what the guy, the hit twist who

351
00:42:58,085 --> 00:43:00,305
did that story of variety

352
00:43:00,725 --> 00:43:04,725
authority of sobriety Murphy. He did not do this basic research.

353
00:43:05,697 --> 00:43:08,987
That would have confirmed, you know, that the real woman's

354
00:43:09,364 --> 00:43:20,289
story was not true. So... Yeah. And you mentioned too that Scrooge Donald are they are. They're very impulsive. This whole story feels very impulsive to me.

355
00:43:20,787 --> 00:43:23,901
So they they're on board and and after...

356
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,380
Oh, they they also tell him the the most promising

357
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:35,701
detail that they're gonna tell on the next page is that the the Falcon rover was reported with all hands being lost

358
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:43,070
just a few days after or leaving that island. So Donald takes a moment to more and, you know, poor pen tail.

359
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:49,096
And they they get packed including shovel, and they head off to the airport,

360
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:51,989
and bucket, who should be

361
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:55,437
one place ahead of them in line.

362
00:43:56,449 --> 00:44:01,796
Person ahead of them with his own shovel because that's seems to be a big point in this entire story. Right.

363
00:44:02,953 --> 00:44:03,791
It's uncle Scrooge.

364
00:44:04,324 --> 00:44:13,098
Right there, I love that the shovel almost feels like its own character here. U. Dual breaker. It's the plot mover. Could they not just buy shove when Huey, get.

365
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:21,790
Exactly. No shovel and Trinidad. That you gotta pay the pay the luggage. You gotta go to the trouble of taking one on the airline.

366
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:31,096
The idea one thing I wanna address is like sort of sad look on Doll face when he found out that Pen tilt died, he's basically realizing, oh, yeah. I died at one point.

367
00:44:31,828 --> 00:44:36,315
Like but, yeah. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here Al. Right. That's how past lives work.

368
00:44:36,732 --> 00:44:44,795
Yeah. It's a very mel calling little moments that that you know, Barks doesn't have time to dwell on. But it it does definitely makes you think...

369
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,555
Yeah. This is a weird and and kind of

370
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,810
more idea. So

371
00:44:50,189 --> 00:44:51,185
So with Scrooge

372
00:44:51,863 --> 00:45:00,215
ahead of him in line, he feels... He doesn't feel like he has to keep it secret. He introduces himself as Donald old b man,

373
00:45:00,895 --> 00:45:01,875
Mick dot

374
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:09,986
The docks have a nice little p for, the the the Nephews, say Kill H for swabs, this would have to happen.

375
00:45:10,785 --> 00:45:12,104
And Scrooge.

376
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:23,416
He's he's pretty cut throat here. What what does he do? Fuck. He does something that carries on through most Inducks stories. He decides to buy all the seats left on the through that plane.

377
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,409
Room for his shovel.

378
00:45:27,187 --> 00:45:32,521
Right and this is something where Barks is really flexible. He will use screws

379
00:45:33,035 --> 00:45:33,973
stream thrifty

380
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:47,263
for gigs when he wants to having him unwilling to, like, spring for a a modern map. For a dollar instead of a dime and say the great steamboat raise because that's funny, and it's in character.

381
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:55,360
And then in this one, he'll likewise, he'll uses a stream wealth and have him be a little bit spend for for another good guy.

382
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:09,985
There there's no real logic to it, but it but is very funny. It's a fun and almost Friday thing about screws to think of how much you could accomplish just by throwing down a stack. And I think people sort of forget that you the characters like, say the penguin. Or

383
00:46:10,641 --> 00:46:48,946
from batman who can throw his wealth around to get horrible things done. Those things they heard Scrooge, they sometimes a occur along gold. But for Scrooge is like no, no. He will throw that money around, usually to teach someone lesson, and usually, it's not or if it's stressed out, say in Ducktales and the storage around the economy because his money's is on the top floor of of Al hotel. He just sound like, no, I'll just buy the whole building. And just call it quits. Like, he can just do that. And for anyone else that be like, you'd have to, like, I can't just buy it. Now Scrooge has that kind of money. No right? He can walk in somewhere and just buy whatever he's looking at.

384
00:46:49,946 --> 00:46:50,186
For.

385
00:46:50,946 --> 00:47:02,299
And Scrooge story tell, they have this great leeway because of what Barks is done. And how he goes both ways with. So we we're gonna transition pretty quickly here to Lonely Island.

386
00:47:02,658 --> 00:47:05,112
Screws has got a kind of a little boats

387
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:10,686
He's got at least a days head start on Donald. And, you know, he

388
00:47:11,866 --> 00:47:12,981
transitioned to the boat

389
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,661
moment. He... He's kind of... He's kind of mu over what he's done to get ready checking his preparations.

390
00:47:20,459 --> 00:47:28,091
And he thinks to himself, I took off in a Mon dr Hurry, who? I don't think I've ever encountered that word before.

391
00:47:29,048 --> 00:47:41,287
I took off in a Mon stray hurry, but I'm sure I didn't forget us. Thing, you know, which is gonna be a nice little hints that he has forgotten something. Mon str. Yeah. I don't see that. And

392
00:47:41,664 --> 00:47:46,932
I don't see that. In the dictionary or anything. So it looks like that that was Barks cleaning

393
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:56,955
his own adjective there. And and so, you know, you might think that the net fuse wouldn't have bothered since they're gonna be so far behind in the race.

394
00:47:57,595 --> 00:48:10,959
But they have... They've spent Donald money for their passage. They're very for lauren about it. And they're even more down hard when they learn that a fear tropical storm is making it necessary for them to land

395
00:48:11,298 --> 00:48:12,997
in the South American Main.

396
00:48:13,656 --> 00:48:22,232
And and it's gonna keep them out of the game for a while. Right? Back up? Mh. It's... It's one of those moments where when you lose this heat this

397
00:48:22,688 --> 00:48:24,322
this lead because by default,

398
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:36,197
on that plain. Means he's already there. He's he's already a day ahead. Right. And it's very hard to make up a day. Alright. Because we say ourselves like, if whether we have a project do anything, when we lose the day.

399
00:48:36,817 --> 00:48:45,523
You're never gonna get that day back. You'd have to do double the work, but this is us trying to get somewhere And then, of course, the weather happens and it just makes it so much worse.

400
00:48:46,419 --> 00:48:49,212
So they have a perfect Gottfredson to feel so bad about this.

401
00:48:50,066 --> 00:48:52,606
Right. And and if not for this weather

402
00:48:53,026 --> 00:48:53,426
situation,

403
00:48:54,306 --> 00:49:09,183
because that storm is gonna end up effect things Scrooge really badly. And and the Nephews user kind of board waiting in their hotel until they venture out again. And they decide to take a look at the storm. It does look like a pretty pretty significant one. And

404
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,338
it's a really neat little

405
00:49:12,051 --> 00:49:25,936
small splash panel that he does of the storm itself. It's one of the... There's not a lot of really flash here show panels in this one. But this one's pretty cool that the Caribbean kids in full roar as Donald sets.

406
00:49:26,951 --> 00:49:30,211
And and the Caribbean in full roar is pretty dangerous.

407
00:49:30,591 --> 00:49:34,971
It's just an interesting scene to see like, hey. Looks crazy out there. Just

408
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:44,841
Caribbean storms are are no joke, especially on the screen. It's really just sort of setting you up, hey, this is going to happen. The thing Scrooge forgot to check was the weather, which is a

409
00:49:45,459 --> 00:49:57,630
the rule for people going on the sea or the ocean, you know, you check the weather. Because right it's more than a day you could lose it there. And you're right. I'm glad you pointed that out. I forgot to mention that Scrooge has that that

410
00:49:58,048 --> 00:49:58,548
recollection.

411
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:02,697
He's says blast my pinnacle, I did forget to check something.

412
00:50:04,255 --> 00:50:06,234
There there's a lot of pretty straightforward

413
00:50:06,772 --> 00:50:07,272
storytelling

414
00:50:07,691 --> 00:50:10,486
in this one. It's fine. It's very serviceable.

415
00:50:10,826 --> 00:50:15,666
So what do the du end up seeing throughout this storm search?

416
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:32,068
They see a rather familiar boat, just sort of, you know, losing it out there in the Caribbean sea going back and forth being pretty much tossed around like a bean bag in the Caribbean salt storm. And Donald just wants to go up there,

417
00:50:32,644 --> 00:50:36,630
Hue and Dub That's their Donald holds your horse which I do appreciate

418
00:50:37,089 --> 00:50:43,342
that the the nephews have totally invested in this pirate story that they've just changed their accurate and everything else.

419
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:56,716
This like hide behind the rock. And because this boat it turns out is uncle Sp boat. That has crashed on the rocks. Right. That's right. As you say, it's it's a nice little touch that Bark makes all of the characters

420
00:50:57,055 --> 00:50:57,555
throughout

421
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,953
use a little bit of this old maritime

422
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:23,201
slang And and and he doesn't it. It doesn't get, like, higher some I don't think. It's also interesting that, you know, it's donald here who really wants to be kind of the good deed do and the nephews were like, hold up. Let's do. See who this is. But you're right, they discover that it's uncle screws forced to go to shore again with that shovel. That's the only thing that he's saved.

423
00:51:23,921 --> 00:51:37,901
So the docs are very cheered because everyone's on even putting now. We do get another really cool full width splash panel of of the storm and all of its glory. It's like wrecking every ship on the island.

424
00:51:39,036 --> 00:51:40,916
Very neat. I like that one a lot.

425
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:46,391
But but Scrooge does notice one nice gift that's been

426
00:51:47,249 --> 00:51:51,356
secured high and drive of the waves. You wanna tell us about that interaction?

427
00:51:51,915 --> 00:51:59,813
He sees it. Okay. Cool. Skip. Got this. I just gotta get this skip good. He goes to visit the... To see the gentleman who owns the house

428
00:52:00,152 --> 00:52:08,052
who presume it owns to skip. He's like, hey, I'd like to mention you about after the storm, and you turn around and the storm was happened to the ski.

429
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:10,006
And with the gentleman acts,

430
00:52:10,782 --> 00:52:12,797
it was you asked the dumbest questions.

431
00:52:13,374 --> 00:52:20,390
Just goes off. It's it's a great bit of pacing. Right? It asked him for it in one panel. A tree

432
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:23,939
destroys it in another. And and the guy is like

433
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:25,429
it's still a deal.

434
00:52:25,926 --> 00:52:33,742
I I found it very funny. It's a it's a good little gag in the midst of it. So we transition to the end of the storm.

435
00:52:34,876 --> 00:52:39,231
And the Ducktales making plans to be the first to get to Lonely island.

436
00:52:39,591 --> 00:52:40,091
But

437
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,627
as they inquire about renting a boat,

438
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:49,770
It's cute. Some of the villagers are kinda cheering. The storm is over a eva had a Sunshine

439
00:52:50,348 --> 00:52:52,245
and a little bit of pigeon English

440
00:52:52,624 --> 00:53:06,132
span Span. I guess. Mh. It's worth noting that, you know, this is not one of those stories where the people on the island are treated with... That they're treated very respect. There's not not a ton of stereo.

441
00:53:06,509 --> 00:53:10,892
Going on here. At least relative to some of the other stories that would have similar settings.

442
00:53:11,585 --> 00:53:20,939
And so they talked to someone who points out that the only craft left to afloat in these waters is one called the little pageant raider

443
00:53:21,252 --> 00:53:26,672
which is a small copy of an English man war that's used in, like, their pageant.

444
00:53:27,452 --> 00:53:33,636
So this is a nice touch. Right? Because the Ducktales that the ship would be... Or basically, it would be a replica

445
00:53:34,014 --> 00:53:37,127
of the falcon Rover, but but in small scale,

446
00:53:38,061 --> 00:53:47,286
So they want a rush to be the first ones to rent it, but but as with the airport, they recognize the voice of a certain someone

447
00:53:47,786 --> 00:54:14,111
who is just one step ahead. To wanna read the line there that that Scrooge uses bucket. That welcome my eyes. This is the clone crap I've seen since I barge gold down the Yukon, but I'll have to rent it and it turns out it's uncle Scrooge in case the Yukon bit didn't give me the give you the clue. But it's always nice to hear cro screwed. It's it's one of my favorite things. That out all the different iterations. If he's not cro, I don't want him.

448
00:54:15,445 --> 00:54:19,712
Yeah. I really like that line. I find that very funny. So again, the Ducktales

449
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:22,302
spare, but they do get this

450
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:35,982
opportunity because Scrooge is is gonna have a really hard time finding a crew to to run what is basically like a show boat. And so, what what is the Ducktales sprite idea bucket?

451
00:54:36,996 --> 00:55:01,217
They have taken the bride and pretty ingenious idea really of, you know, putting on a disguise and, you know, pretending to be his crew, like can't. He needs a crew, he won't clearly won't help us let's pretend to be actual hard and say who know what's going on and, you know, these group. It's charming it's hilarious, the costumes are adorable and it's hell hilarious Scrooge screw just identifies them as a one I'd sailor in three digits.

452
00:55:02,747 --> 00:55:08,311
Right. And, of course, you know, that's a term that is definitely out of fashion these days.

453
00:55:08,807 --> 00:55:18,477
It was very commonly used in in that era, so I won't pick on Barks for using it, but but it should... It should be noted that we would call them little people today.

454
00:55:19,451 --> 00:55:37,030
But they're pretty funny like classic marks disguise. Right? Mh. Yeah. Yeah. The nephews look deceptive enough that you would that I could see how sk wouldn't think. They were his grand Nephews, but Donald clearly. Clearly all he is done. Is cover one eye. Right.

455
00:55:38,226 --> 00:55:43,831
I looks more like buzz in Pint frankly now. I think the trick is that

456
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:46,282
down doesn't have a shovel. I think that's the clue.

457
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,635
The shovel would be giving him away.

458
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:50,013
Right.

459
00:55:51,491 --> 00:55:54,389
Excellent. So again, this is pretty straightforward

460
00:55:54,967 --> 00:56:02,205
in in a longer Barks story, he probably would've have stretched this last voyage out a little bit. They might have encountered something else.

461
00:56:03,043 --> 00:56:08,181
But we're just we're heading towards our islands and and, you know, the Nephews are kind of

462
00:56:08,637 --> 00:56:11,249
celebrating their clever idea in in secret

463
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,486
saying we couldn't beat uncle Scrooge to the treasure. So we'll just get there at the same time. And, eventually, they

464
00:56:18,984 --> 00:56:20,003
they land

465
00:56:21,154 --> 00:56:24,425
Scrooge sp Lonely island with a spy Gladstone

466
00:56:24,545 --> 00:56:25,564
Donald comments.

467
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,171
Do you wanna tell us Donald line

468
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:32,261
swallow my sc. It looks just like you did in fifteen sixty four.

469
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:33,937
Yeah.

470
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:45,428
And and so screwed commands that they stay aboard as he'll go a sure alone in the demi of the little boat. And Donald now revealed himself shockingly.

471
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:51,174
Saying you wouldn't be leaving your old buddy behind. Would you maybe mac Ducktales

472
00:56:51,255 --> 00:56:53,926
I love that... I love Scrooge just outraged

473
00:56:54,465 --> 00:56:55,384
surprise here. Right?

474
00:56:56,063 --> 00:57:00,877
Donald you horn swapping flow back to a pint tilt pirate. You tricks me.

475
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:10,805
That's a great line. You know, so Scrooge is just gonna he's gonna have to make the best of it. They're gonna try and and do the honorable thing.

476
00:57:11,142 --> 00:57:12,799
It's it's kind of hilarious

477
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:17,960
because this could have all been exactly the same story. How do they just agreed to go together?

478
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:20,629
You are. That's really.

479
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:23,426
There's not much ant

480
00:57:24,164 --> 00:57:26,621
in the back and forth Granted, that will be clearly

481
00:57:26,975 --> 00:57:29,316
and undone in the next sequence,

482
00:57:29,735 --> 00:57:30,995
but it was still just

483
00:57:31,455 --> 00:57:57,250
just a fun bits that I think hadn't been played up a bit more. It would have felt a bit more deserving of the shock, but Scrooge down had been like vague sw has been missing donald like every other chance. She sort of have a back and forth with them. There's no real pb dialogue outside of the shock that donald here on the Scrooge just here and mcdonald's here. With his shuttle uncle group is here with a shovel, and now, we're gonna see these shovel pay off.

484
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:06,703
Right. Right. He know what just occurred to me actually, when you mentioned this could have been the same story with someone else I feel like there's a lost

485
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:14,144
opportunity to have had a specific villain in this story. I think I would have liked to have seen Chi Mcs

486
00:58:14,682 --> 00:58:22,635
from the horse ra story. As as the antagonist. I'm I'm imagining if he were if he Scrooge is off opposition.

487
00:58:23,393 --> 00:58:36,925
You know, instead of Donald and Donald was was part of the same deal that could been really interesting because of course, they faced off in this same Caribbean part of the world and and And you know, the the idea of the horse

488
00:58:37,665 --> 00:58:41,980
being this, like, weird, but at the time precious cargo

489
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:57,767
in that story, kinda plays well with how this one. So so just an idle thought, but but I also really like Chi to as a villa I thought he would have been needs to stick around. Yeah. That idea is that is actually better than mind. My thought was just to go sort of basic

490
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:26,415
not sure if you've been introduced you yet at this point, but we could've have brought our Al on this. Another moment for them to have a back and forth. Because that would have worked even more you could have had it be that, you know, Donald needs work. Alright? You Al Donald tends to. And he is hired. By global, doesn't even know it's going like, hey, this guy, the switch guy needs me to go help find a treasure. And by the time he finds out it's blowing, it's too late he's already there. And the nephews user there... It it would all still sort of work. Right. Yeah. It's it's funny. You say that because this is almost

491
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:47,017
with the second rich duck. I haven't released it yet, but I... It's I just recorded it a couple of nights ago. It'll be the episode right before this one. So Oh so, yeah. If you if he had in the mood to reuse Guam, I could definitely see it working out. Yeah. And if he had done that, I'm sure I'm sure we have seen a lot more appearances.

492
00:59:47,569 --> 00:59:54,069
Alright. So, anyway, tell us tell us about their arrival on the beach. So as soon as they get there and...

493
00:59:54,508 --> 01:00:01,983
Despite the fact they're two grown adults who've realize they both kinda have a stake in this. It's like you know what? Let's just fight with these shovel.

494
01:00:02,701 --> 01:00:07,687
Alright. Al salute Boston Pint says Scrooge to the treasure, long lived the treasure,

495
01:00:08,106 --> 01:00:18,069
and Huey, just wash his two grown men, fighting with shovel. And this is Let let's be clear a shovel is not the safest thing. To know people.

496
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:24,417
And but luckily, these three ten year olds just tackle their grown adults. And grown.

497
01:00:25,035 --> 01:00:32,625
And like, aren't you shave yourself? Al of that notable about how you made long ago, he wanted to find it over the treasure like a pair of common pirates.

498
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:36,005
To up I personally made no valves.

499
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,439
Right. Right.

500
01:00:38,858 --> 01:00:39,877
It's hilarious

501
01:00:40,696 --> 01:00:52,237
you're right. That fights really funny. I like how it starts out with them, like, basically pretending to be noble or making an effort to it, Right, salute each other, and then it just dev.

502
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:55,730
I also like how it it totally parallels,

503
01:00:56,190 --> 01:01:03,016
the val that they had previously made to Queen Ba, But, of course, this one is much less noble they're just

504
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:10,765
the treasure itself. So, yeah. The Nephews point out that, you know, there's nothing worth fighting over

505
01:01:11,102 --> 01:01:19,605
until we confirm that this isn't some sort of double dream But why don't you take us home and and tell us about the actual

506
01:01:20,225 --> 01:01:25,880
excavation here. So after nice rapid digging fast, just really great Severino.

507
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:32,020
Seconds later as the nail reports out they find the chest, it's a relatively light chest and

508
01:01:32,854 --> 01:01:38,080
don't have like, you know, whatever say, it's ours You know, Queen Basketball won't miss the money. You know? Okay. Sure.

509
01:01:38,998 --> 01:01:40,035
They found that it's empty,

510
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:53,651
but it isn't empty. There's some dried potatoes inside. Along with Al letter, and the it explains everything written by caps talk, it is my friend belief that these strange one vegetables will be greatly surprised by her imperial majesty

511
01:01:54,029 --> 01:01:55,306
and dewey we points out. Yeah.

512
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:04,500
Potatoes were unknown left time and Louie, which I think this is a very really question Well, what do you boys going to do with your rare old treasure

513
01:02:04,934 --> 01:02:11,421
And for the first time they're generally on the same page as whole story, and they decide to beat the brakes off

514
01:02:12,517 --> 01:02:17,181
off the Treasure chest And so we're gonna do way worse to a couple of.

515
01:02:18,316 --> 01:02:22,006
It it's a it's a solid ending. It's a nice little

516
01:02:22,344 --> 01:02:23,575
Barks likes these

517
01:02:24,234 --> 01:02:24,734
imminent

518
01:02:25,193 --> 01:02:27,171
threat of violence endings.

519
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:36,651
It it's pretty funny, and this is a fun trope. Right? The the the the treasure is something that would have been valuable at the time,

520
01:02:37,507 --> 01:02:40,083
but no longer holds any value whatsoever

521
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:43,095
today. That that's a trope that I've always

522
01:02:43,435 --> 01:02:46,835
enjoyed, and it works really well in this context.

523
01:02:47,275 --> 01:02:50,175
All in all, I think this is a really solid ending.

524
01:02:50,569 --> 01:02:54,576
To... You know, I I mentioned that the that the story doesn't

525
01:02:55,191 --> 01:03:05,686
necessarily feel rushed but as we've gone through it, I I'm kinda reconsider... I I do think this feels a little bit rushed and it coulda used maybe three or four more pages to breathe. Yeah.

526
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:10,440
I think the problem is that the the conflict is so

527
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,895
weak and and shallow in a lot of ways

528
01:03:13,553 --> 01:03:25,559
because there's no reason why Scrooge wouldn't wanna work with donald the story outside of the fact he wants the treasure for himself. It really feels like bugs wanna create social a disconnect between the sort of noble

529
01:03:26,494 --> 01:03:43,535
men that Malcolm and Boston Pent tell were that they're doing this service of the queen of the captain of the service they provided here, these two just want the treasure. Yeah. I think you're right. There's there's a lot of... He tries to get a lot of mileage out of these

530
01:03:43,874 --> 01:03:44,374
contrast.

531
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:46,651
And it largely works

532
01:03:47,004 --> 01:03:55,895
but, you know, maybe not as well as it could have. I also tend to like the the stories where Barks does a really great job of book ending.

533
01:03:56,269 --> 01:03:58,723
Know and we don't really get that book here,

534
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:02,671
there there's no returning to Ducktales sequence

535
01:04:03,168 --> 01:04:05,423
We don't see like, the the hit

536
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:12,875
To me, it would have been funny or if we saw the hit is, like escaping out his Barks door with

537
01:04:13,309 --> 01:04:16,683
Scrooge and Donald both holding up their shovel men

538
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:22,490
trying to knock their way into to his office or something like that. I don't know I'm I'm just spit football.

539
01:04:23,424 --> 01:04:27,719
But the story it does feel a little bit of abrupt. I I do...

540
01:04:28,178 --> 01:04:46,068
I I enjoy this one. I I think I don't think I expected to enjoy this one as much as I did before I revisited it. You know? Because I remember this. And I always remember thinking this is a pretty weird story. It'll be interesting to talk about this one for the podcast that the hit

541
01:04:46,565 --> 01:05:02,936
stuff always left a a bit of a bad taste in my mouth bucket because it's one of these examples of of a few Barks stories where Barks has screws really invested in something kinda cookie key, and I don't like that. I don't like seeing Scrooge

542
01:05:03,549 --> 01:05:11,224
acting cookie. I think about this one and, like, Al later sixties story where Scrooge is like obsessed with his his,

543
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:22,420
star chart. Trying remember. It's like a... It's it's one where he's looking for a cave full of emerald. The title escapes me right now. But... But I always...

544
01:05:23,058 --> 01:05:28,902
That's just not my bag as far as the story goes where he's into this kind of like new a

545
01:05:29,295 --> 01:05:31,395
off. But but if you do,

546
01:05:31,735 --> 01:05:36,155
if you just accept the premise of this one, I think this is a pretty fun

547
01:05:37,588 --> 01:05:40,845
entertaining story. Yeah. It it it keeps the job done.

548
01:05:41,384 --> 01:05:44,800
I I I agree with you. I like when Foods is sort of put more into the

549
01:05:45,235 --> 01:05:46,955
your grandfather that knows everything.

550
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:56,150
He's the season traveler. I think only a paul of man really showcase that really well. Right. And got this wealth of experiences right on or...

551
01:05:56,770 --> 01:06:05,285
In King solomon minds. I think he shows off his intelligence is a bit more here. This sort of shows Scrooge just still sort of prone to fad

552
01:06:05,705 --> 01:06:12,776
in some ways that... But you have to really sell the profit idea here. That it's worth way more the idea that a Scrooge gives up

553
01:06:13,273 --> 01:06:36,040
on ninety dollars. Is a chance he'll know, come out with so much more. And that would get we saw the same thing in the golden fleece. Like, you know, even when even though screwed is a bit, you know, ridiculously trusting of of of this mysterious person, the always was was like, this, I'm not quite sure. I don't... No. I don't... Then he gets these Ac the golden fleece is put in front of them. And you sort of...

554
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:46,675
The rash side, it sort of goes goes to sleep a bit or it's like push aside. Right. Yeah. And and it helps in this one he's he is skeptical of it until he's actually

555
01:06:47,095 --> 01:06:47,335
ties.

556
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:55,450
But, you know, he's open enough to it to to buy in. It's it's just not the kind of premise that's for me. But

557
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,698
but I This is a fun one on the whole.

558
01:06:59,593 --> 01:07:04,437
I would I would put this. I would kinda slot this in as like an average

559
01:07:04,909 --> 01:07:31,950
Barks story is kind of the way I think of it it's your your typical just fine Barks story, which, of course, you know, in in terms compared to, like, a lot of other comments creators, that still places it in its own sort of range of greatness. Right? Mh. It's a it's a solid story that I think it's only real downside is it's completed. It's competing against other really good stories. Right. But it's still... It's still... Again, still solid, it's still funny.

560
01:07:33,122 --> 01:07:46,210
Reread this here, I've never realized how much I love the character of the shovel. Alright. This is this is top tier or character here. Alright. Like, I I think Bard should have really got a whole series about this organization of shovel.

561
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:58,169
March universe. Alright? Because stop going on here. The shop is the michelle will start this store in its own way and then they end the story and this how shovel there the treasure a shovel

562
01:07:58,706 --> 01:08:03,014
could be used to protect the treasure that has shovel destroyed is the treasure. Yeah.

563
01:08:04,785 --> 01:08:06,085
Like poetry which arrives.

564
01:08:07,105 --> 01:08:44,884
Right. Yeah. It is it is a very funny bit. I do. I do like the over use of the treasure for of of the shovel for comic effect. It's it's really good. Let's see. I I think we covered that pretty well. Are you ready to get into kind of the the community consensus for this story? Yes. Let let let's see what the what the people have to say. Right. So so it sounds like you and I are in pretty close agreement. Right? That this is neither of our favorite stories, but there's nothing like really objection about it and and it's it's a fine time. It's it's a good. It's a good enough story.

565
01:08:45,761 --> 01:08:47,556
If we check in on Inducks,

566
01:08:48,050 --> 01:09:06,737
you know, which is the great resource that has all kinds of information about Disney comics and that users can can rate the comments on. So it gives us pretty pretty good idea of what community thinks. This one gets a seven point seven out of ten bucket And and that's a that's pretty solid.

567
01:09:07,154 --> 01:09:18,439
It's good for a numeric score of... It's it's a ranked score of one hundred and twenty six. As of right now out of all the Disney comments. So, you know, it's not coming in in the top hundred

568
01:09:18,856 --> 01:09:29,462
or anything, but it's definitely, like in the higher here of Barks Adventures. I I don't remember. I made a... I made a very nerdy list at some point and I did like

569
01:09:29,935 --> 01:09:34,506
I did. What do you call those things with the video games where they they rank characters

570
01:09:35,721 --> 01:09:41,920
by tier... A tiers list? They did a tiers list at one point. And I believe this one was just in that average range.

571
01:09:42,638 --> 01:09:48,220
Probably probably well into the upper half though. Of stories as most of these really Scrooge adventures.

572
01:09:48,634 --> 01:09:51,843
Are. But, yeah, people like this one well enough. And

573
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:56,147
it has had a little bit of an after life in other Disney.

574
01:09:56,739 --> 01:09:57,918
Right? You had mentioned...

575
01:09:58,416 --> 01:10:05,902
You'd already alluded to the fact that Don Rosa uses some of these details to to flash out his life and times

576
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:20,910
you mentioned chapter five. Right? That's that's where we're gonna get the most That's a very strange chapter. In that series. I'm I'm guessing it's probably the most divisive chapter. For a lot of people.

577
01:10:22,107 --> 01:10:28,615
Maybe. Maybe... I know I loved it. I love it as kid. But then again, I read that entire story out of order.

578
01:10:29,836 --> 01:10:32,055
Sure sure. I started with part twelve

579
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:33,989
And that would be

580
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:39,881
didn't even know. It was part twelve. I'd like this looks cool. I no idea what's food is so sad.

581
01:10:41,811 --> 01:10:45,184
Right. But last page was really good. And I remember reading

582
01:10:45,961 --> 01:10:48,390
Part five and large of Castle mc Inducks, and

583
01:10:48,770 --> 01:11:21,075
Seeing going to Inducks kevin and seeing all these other Inducks really sort of showed you a bit more that I thought was really capable of this story at this time. Guess This was this is the only comments I was reading at time. I didn't have any access to really anything I saw it and went with it. And hearing that that seem like quietly circle Quack Inducks Al has call, Al malcolm duck out when he says that Screws invested all his money and the cattle energy before it went bust, he has no business sense. And so quack points out, and who went down with the falcon roll with fifteen sixty four on a treasure hunt ford potatoes.

584
01:11:23,015 --> 01:11:27,290
Like, it may been special to England at the time, but there's no financial feature

585
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:29,170
potatoes.

586
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:34,505
Yeah. So that that chapter... I mean, I I I love... I love that. Series.

587
01:11:35,044 --> 01:12:00,801
But, like, there are parts of it where I look back on that one. I'm like that, that's pretty weird. Right? That, you know, in a way that is a little bit to comforting to me. But... But then if I think about this story, I Barks had his moments where he went went with these kinda cookie premises too. So So in light of that, it's definitely not that weird at all. Let's see. You know, I but I I think I've pretty much gotten to share all of my thoughts other than doing, like, a

588
01:12:01,461 --> 01:12:07,461
checking in on our favorite panels. Do you have any other any other thoughts that you'd really wanted to mention regarding this story?

589
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:09,015
So

590
01:12:09,515 --> 01:12:14,216
my my version, which I think is is the original version. I do like

591
01:12:14,555 --> 01:12:16,031
when Scrooge is

592
01:12:16,611 --> 01:12:22,350
clothes or that one set color. This times where it's green, and I really like the green. This sort of burgundy.

593
01:12:22,651 --> 01:12:41,160
And like a really good color for which was another thing going into the comics was very awkward for me to get... Because I was used to the red and blue from the Ducktales car. Right. I think my favorite scene would have to be sort of at the end when donald and screws, you know, pledged to the treasure and of course, the flash

594
01:12:41,594 --> 01:12:45,322
of malcolm and... Or maybe dot this one and

595
01:12:45,698 --> 01:12:50,836
pen Al making you the pledge to the queen. And of course, the the scene of the beginning,

596
01:12:51,173 --> 01:12:58,505
just sort of seeing Scrooge in his money office, which I think it is the actual Bin because you can see the little window. And.

597
01:12:59,082 --> 01:13:01,634
Yeah. Yeah. I think it's one of his overflow rooms.

598
01:13:02,352 --> 01:13:08,570
Yeah. Those are that's a good choice. I I like that contrast between those two salute a lot.

599
01:13:08,989 --> 01:13:16,681
As as far as, like favorite panels, I'm thinking about it and and in this read through, it really stood out to me the

600
01:13:17,634 --> 01:13:35,305
the the smashing into each other while holding the shovel. That... That's just such a great slaps stick panel. I also really like the very first panel where he travels back to the past, and you see them growing their their gift to the shore the first time that they appear as their past lives themselves

601
01:13:35,923 --> 01:13:47,846
There's just some really beautiful details, a nice illustration of that we see the I guess, it's our only real shot of the Falcon rover. In fact. In the whole thing. So there's a good view of the falcon Rover or a couple of

602
01:13:48,305 --> 01:14:00,791
another example of Barks bird for grounding where he draws couple of a bunch of assistants Barks around and... Yes. It's just really lovely. Lovely panel. And then I did really like that sequence where the

603
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:10,361
The the dry doctor vote gets crushed immediately. Scrooge is bargain before it Any mean, any other favorite panels that came to mind for you?

604
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:16,256
Anytime you would doing Louie are allowed to look so cynical about what is it going on.

605
01:14:16,736 --> 01:14:22,411
There's nothing there's nothing like amazingly drawn about it. It's it's just a steady standard moment. But

606
01:14:22,831 --> 01:14:25,791
anytime those three are sort of forced to be the voice of reason,

607
01:14:26,486 --> 01:14:47,124
I just sort of enjoy because you almost forget from moment that they're nine to ten year olds. Right. And it's a fun thing. You'll see in sort like the Simpsons with Lisa, and it's always fun because then you go to so where they are just allowed to be kids. And right. It's still hilarious and it's still fun. Then all of a sudden their their geniuses. And it's fun and

608
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:54,314
I've been debating on my next Ducktales lo video. And I'm not ready for donald. There's is way too much of donald.

609
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:59,953
But I was thinking you're dude here were doing Louie because they... While they free interchangeable

610
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:06,786
in the in the comics. There's always a special role they play. Maybe not individuals but as is collective fun unit.

611
01:15:07,361 --> 01:15:22,706
Of of characters that they like donald, they can sort of adjust to any story, but rather they adjust to whatever role the store needs and to be in. Yeah. They they're very reflective of whatever the store needs them to be. And I love them for that. Yeah. That's that's I think that's right. They're definitely a unit.

612
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:27,421
And and definitely in this one, it's pretty rare that they're even named

613
01:15:28,001 --> 01:15:35,542
individually. You know, you were pointing out their cynical kinda sequence. I I just was going through this part. Check out this panel

614
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:43,031
where they're pouring over the log book and they kinda dive in to get a closer look and the two nephews on the outside.

615
01:15:43,469 --> 01:15:45,165
Sandwich, the middle connect.

616
01:15:46,181 --> 01:16:05,315
Memorable. That that panel, I really like too. That's really cool. Yeah. It is is it is a fun one. It it really is. And I think one thing I've always liked about the nephews in regards to this, is there's always been the question as to the inevitable moment when Scrooge will go unquote pass or travel through time, going out match fitness bell.

617
01:16:05,874 --> 01:16:06,711
The jury is still out.

618
01:16:07,684 --> 01:16:17,136
Who would take over and he's always sort of implied that it will not be done. As much as he secretly likes donald. Donald not the one. He does love the potential the hard work ethic,

619
01:16:17,474 --> 01:16:19,330
the open minded of the nephews.

620
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:37,350
And here, they're not so much Al short off open minded, but in this and the goal the least, they show off there the maturity, but they're hesitate to always go for the shiny anything thing going on here, and I do like that. They've got a lot more risk strength than the adult dots and in some of these stories for sure.

621
01:16:37,949 --> 01:16:41,136
It sort of goes with the idea that a full and his money is parted

622
01:16:42,034 --> 01:16:50,296
The boys mentioned like, Donald going to risk his entire quote unquote fortune Scrooge has not only lost ninety dollars, but however much she paid,

623
01:16:50,830 --> 01:17:02,384
for all the of the plane as well as to rent out. The replica the fan Rover of Falcon Rover, Huey, lost all of that. For a treasure chest of trill up potatoes.

624
01:17:04,475 --> 01:17:04,555
Yeah.

625
01:17:05,312 --> 01:17:10,492
Yeah. It's a fun. It's a fun out. Come. It's not it's not maybe the most memorable ending.

626
01:17:11,468 --> 01:17:17,725
I mean I mean, I guess it is fairly memorable actually. Probably the most memorable part of this story. Is...

627
01:17:18,422 --> 01:17:20,916
I mean, certainly, it's the the actual

628
01:17:21,652 --> 01:17:35,093
traveling back to the past. The the past lives regression. But Al close second would be that ending itself, which which has a nice little kit. Yeah. The story is more selling the the gimmick of hi. This isn't the story that really elevate

629
01:17:36,004 --> 01:17:58,645
screwed donald to the characters that we tend to think of them as. This sort goes was like, no. That there was a time when they were just Scrooge donald. And in the same way that you would look at what we expect from characters like batman now was not expected of him at the time this was all written now. He was just looking for a good the end. And this is a good time to be had. Yeah. Yeah. I think I this an adventure that's well worth joining the du on

630
01:17:59,185 --> 01:18:04,015
if if mostly to laugh Al them. Alright. I I did just... Try to mention duck.

631
01:18:04,592 --> 01:18:07,726
Right? I'll just I'm not aware of any

632
01:18:08,223 --> 01:18:17,234
of any time that duck tried to adopt this in either of the series iterations. But I don't have that great memory of the

633
01:18:17,691 --> 01:18:22,408
second one. Because I only gave it one watch through. Do you know of any reference to this story?

634
01:18:23,803 --> 01:18:26,932
So if I'm not mistaken in the

635
01:18:27,284 --> 01:18:28,983
curse of Castle

636
01:18:29,602 --> 01:18:37,445
was... I forget the name of the episode. It's it's early and season one. When they go to visit castle like document, I do believe you'll see Malcolm medium Inducks

637
01:18:37,883 --> 01:18:41,930
as one of the ghost and cows Inducks, but that's pretty much it. Now

638
01:18:42,347 --> 01:18:55,738
original or the reboot address this particular story because it's really not that exciting story. It's It's pretty generic in terms of the premise. If you take off hi. There's a treasure we go look for it. That's kind of it.

639
01:18:56,377 --> 01:18:59,254
Nothing nothing really more than Al fleeting reference.

640
01:19:00,053 --> 01:19:02,791
Excellent life. I think we did an admirable

641
01:19:03,425 --> 01:19:05,542
job of covering this one.

642
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:14,899
So let's see. I guess we should... I guess we should give each other a nice shovel salute and and wrap the story up.

643
01:19:15,656 --> 01:19:31,599
I I really appreciate you joining me for this one bucket bucket think tank of course is your channel on Youtube, right? Where people can find your duck, videos, Ducktales, lower videos, as well as other things. And anything else you wanted to mention or promote?

644
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:32,840
So

645
01:19:33,699 --> 01:19:39,146
the Ducktales lower video, I have no set date for that because I'm still not even a hundred percent sure I wanted you were doing Louie.

646
01:19:39,824 --> 01:19:48,590
Because what I do for those is I would go for each iteration of them as possible. Now for the common version, it's more... They don't really stand out as individuals.

647
01:19:49,190 --> 01:20:13,247
But you go to say it's different cartoons and generations. One thing I'm somewhat proud of is what I saw the first episode of twenty seventeen, when I know exactly which episodes the original Ducktales they use for the Al. I do want to see if I could think of another another video where I would compare different stories or ideas. From, say the twenty seventeen series to other versions, especially if I could find the actual

648
01:20:13,664 --> 01:20:15,201
that it was based off. Thankfully

649
01:20:15,778 --> 01:20:18,728
fantastic graphics graphics terrible what it's called.

650
01:20:20,258 --> 01:20:27,333
Is been a great help. Oh, I know. It's it's it's nice to have. It's it's nice to have someone.

651
01:20:27,884 --> 01:20:32,912
Still releasing dot com in some form in the states. Is these right?

652
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:39,849
Well well, yeah. People... I I don't people can check out your your lora videos. And

653
01:20:40,466 --> 01:20:50,285

658
01:21:07,454 --> 01:21:07,954
episode

659
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:09,868
should be a.

660
01:21:10,326 --> 01:21:26,905
It's it's a huge favorite of mine. I'm big fan of a cold bargain. So I'm very excited to cover that one. Bucket, I like to... These days I like to close out the episode by having the guest read the last panel. So

661
01:21:27,402 --> 01:21:35,619
even if it's a repeat, close this out. Right. Alright. I'm just gonna go to that page. Alright. But not half as much as we're going to do to a couple of.

662
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:36,659
Excellent.

663
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:42,392
Alright. Thanks again. I really appreciate it, Tar. Thanks for having. Yeah, it's been a pleasure.
