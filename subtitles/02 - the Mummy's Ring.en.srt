So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks.

2
00:00:49,244 --> 00:00:49,744
Alright.

3
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,939
I am Mark Sever,

4
00:00:52,398 --> 00:00:56,310
a grown man who likes to talk talk about Ducktales comics.

5
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,110
And I have with me today if you can introduce yourself,

6
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:07,432
I'm Ryan Bailey. I like Mark. And I largely I'm unfamiliar with duck comics.

7
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:13,180
Yeah. So you're gonna be filling the role, the new role this week.

8
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,440
And

9
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,240
we are going to be talking this week

10
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,491
about Donald Duck and the mum ring.

11
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:25,048
So my my background,

12
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:26,566
I am

13
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:33,963
a super fan of Carl Marx. I've been reading the stories since I was like, eight years old

14
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,015
have

15
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,255
pretty much every one of them.

16
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:38,175
And

17
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:41,975
got it in my head to do a podcast

18
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:49,241
to explore them in order because that's something I've never done. And again, I could talk and talk about them.

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,497
Growing up this is most of what I read. This is most what I was into, at least comic book wise.

20
00:01:57,153 --> 00:01:59,540
Ryan, do you wanna tell me a little bit about

21
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:03,013
your background with Barks and comics in general?

22
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,805
I know almost nothing about Carl marx except for

23
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:08,641
kind of his role in

24
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:10,455
being in an early

25
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:15,755
creator of of this whole world here. I actually didn't read that many comics growing up.

26
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:17,575
It wasn't until

27
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:21,060
like the two thousand eight recession. I was

28
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:24,008
I was well into adulthood and

29
00:02:24,663 --> 00:02:31,114
I had a lot of comics that I had gotten from a friend and I just started reading them at night, and I was like, oh, I really like this.

30
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:32,588
So

31
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:40,191
for the last few years I've had like a marvel and unlimited subscription and everything and I've actually keep track of i've read. I recently passed four thousand

32
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:42,042
issues of Marvel

33
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:43,997
in the last five years.

34
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:46,671
So I usually should read about a thousand

35
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:49,919
comics a year, but almost exclusively marvel,

36
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:55,592
not necessarily with the the quote, funny animal comics. Yes. Exactly.

37
00:02:58,342 --> 00:03:01,954
And at least a couple of the dot comics, the

38
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:07,357
superhero ones are are lamp a little bit as super snoop. So

39
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:09,512
that's awesome. I I

40
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:15,435
am glad that you got a chance because, you know, you and I known each other for...

41
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:24,610
Since the beginning of high school, we've been friends for a long time. And I mean, you probably heard me talk about these a lot.

42
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,090
I don't remember if I lob you

43
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,770
to read them or give them a try. Do you remember if you ever gave them any any try?

44
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:43,470
I don't recall ever actually sitting down and and reading one. I'm sure there must have been some point probably in high school where where you, you know, thrust it into my lap, and was like, read this.

45
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,370
It's amazing and that I probably did. I was like, yeah. That's pretty good.

46
00:03:48,822 --> 00:03:59,906
You know, for someone who's such a big fan, I've I've actually always been really reluctant to thrust or voice them on people because I think there's always a little bit of of embarrassment

47
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:03,022
misplaced, but

48
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,875
nonetheless, a little bit of embarrassment about about what they are. And, you know, growing up. It was definitely

49
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:11,315
cooler to be into the marvel

50
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:26,967
or other superhero comments. My I read some of those too, but these these were my first love. It's very exciting to me to kinda talk about them in the real world and to have this built in excuse to make the people that I know

51
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:39,422
give them a shot. I am gonna go over some of the details about this story. This one, again, as mentioned is called Donald duck and the mum ring, and this is

52
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,505
This was published in September of nineteen

53
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:55,595
forty three. This was originally published in four color and number twenty nine, it has been reprinted many many times. I I think most famously, though, it was

54
00:04:57,095 --> 00:05:02,395
the cover art for the very well received carl Barks in color library,

55
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:22,337
The interesting thing about this story, you know, last episode, I had Eric on who you were were mutual friends, you know, him well, and we talked about the first Barks story, but that was kind of a Al, I think because Donald duck finds pirate gold is only partly a Carl Barks

56
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:25,234
story. It was based on a cartoon

57
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:29,081
script. It was not written by Barks was only partially

58
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,389
done by him. So this is really the first

59
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:33,266
opportunity

60
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:43,622
to get into a Carl Barks story that is a hundred percent his this was created entirely by him and so this

61
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:46,074
represents kind of an early look at his

62
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,584
his independent style what he would go on to do.

63
00:05:51,281 --> 00:06:02,815
Before we get into the story and our thoughts, I'd would love to take them moment to kind of go back in time a bit and talk about what was going on. What what our historical context is

64
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:20,512
There's gonna be a few of these stories around this era that are you can escape the fact that were in the the height of world war two still, we've got I I checked on wikipedia. This is about when Jack these internment

65
00:06:21,368 --> 00:06:25,476
really began in earnest. So there's a pretty sad for you.

66
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:34,040
On on a little bit of a lighter note, This was when Rod are waters of Pink floyd and Gloria gainer. We're both born.

67
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,860
So there's that.

68
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,035
And and then for the purposes

69
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:39,715
of our

70
00:06:40,055 --> 00:06:43,835
podcast today. I think the interesting thing is that the United States

71
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:46,995
and a lot of the world were re reenter

72
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,830
one of their waves of Egypt.

73
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,890
Do do you know much about

74
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,745
about these cycles of egypt

75
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:56,665
Ryan?

76
00:06:58,365 --> 00:06:59,505
No. I don't.

77
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:01,025
I I feel like

78
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:12,905
it's... I've seen it as more as an individual thing where little kids get really into Egypt for a while and they wanna learn more about ph and all that and I didn't realize whole culture did the same thing. Tell me more.

79
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:14,345
Yeah. Absolutely.

80
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:18,385
I i think the Us was one of those little kids

81
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:25,914
several times throughout our history rate. You know, when every time there was a big discovery, i,

82
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,810
you know, in in Egypt and some antiquity,

83
00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:34,469
the country and a lot of the world went through these, like, fever ish

84
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:36,623
friends

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,500
where

86
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:53,537
egyptian call are both modern, but mostly ancient was very involved and it entered the pop culture and, you know, this was, of course, you had the the mummy, Boris karl offs, the mummy is the most famous one from this era.

87
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:55,388
That came out in nineteen

88
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,905
thirty two.

89
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:04,664
So it was... It was a decade old this point, but it it left a big mark on on pop culture.

90
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:07,537
But, yeah, Just egyptian war

91
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:11,740
is something that the Us kind of fell in love with

92
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,060
every couple of decades.

93
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,660
So that... That's kind of what this

94
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,911
came out of. I wanna take some time during each so to talk about if there any notable appearances

95
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,030
character

96
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:25,368
in these stories.

97
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:31,800
There there aren't really a lot of recurrent care directors in this one, you do have a couple of notable

98
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,039
kind of one off characters

99
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,791
in the the Bay Al

100
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:40,441
and his emi series that we'll get into.

101
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:47,435
To me the interesting thing is that just like in the last story. You have

102
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:49,748
the old Disney stand

103
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:50,824
villain

104
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:54,174
black pete or at least someone who basically

105
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:10,290
looks like him is kind of the person who causes a lot of trouble. Oh, I guess they they never actually named him do they in this comment He's just a guy. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Did did you read him as being pete? I did. Yeah. That was my initial thought.

106
00:09:10,944 --> 00:09:19,770
Yeah. So I think, you know, early on, Carl Marx was just figuring things out and and it's kinda what Disney did. That they're alive, we need Villain. We're gonna use pete

107
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:33,415
I I really delighted last episode in when I'm telling Eric one of my favorite Disney facts, which is that Peg leg pee actually pre dates mickey mouse. That's how long they've been going back to that well. So

108
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:40,950
I think Barks is gonna be out of that habit soon. I can't remember specifically if we see any more peak alike, but,

109
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,281
you know, he is it's interesting, that he's just their generic villain. So

110
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:47,876
let's see.

111
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:52,741
I guess this is the first time in one of these episodes that I'm gonna get to go into

112
00:09:53,397 --> 00:10:02,060
what I hope is a recurring segment where we can just talk a little bit about the educational value that was in this story. But I'm thinking

113
00:10:02,574 --> 00:10:06,551
as I go that I'm gonna kind of wait and talk about that

114
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,068
afterwards a little more reflective.

115
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:18,145
But I I will mention that Carl Barks did something in this story that he becomes famous for, and this is gonna be a great example

116
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,433
that he

117
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,470
famously

118
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:24,102
really love to dive into

119
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:30,298
national geographic and other sources for some of these stories to get some awesome and background

120
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:37,564
and to really ground it and something that Huey, was interested in. So this is gonna kinda set that template,

121
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:40,960
and we can talk about some of the things he includes

122
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:42,599
by the end.

123
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:45,076
So Ryan, are you ready

124
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:47,287
to dive into

125
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:49,560
the mommy, the money's reign.

126
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:53,427
Yeah. Yeah. I I I was gonna ask you

127
00:10:53,844 --> 00:10:55,301
the as the expert

128
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:57,670
How much

129
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:03,217
how much of this art style and and even characterization is

130
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:11,840
original Barks and how much of it is what he had to continue from what Disney was using. He didn't he didn't create Donald. Right?

131
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:15,346
Right. Oh, these are great newbie questions.

132
00:11:16,162 --> 00:11:19,014
No. He didn't create Donald. Donald

133
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:22,480
Donald been around for a few years at this point,

134
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,300
he was originally

135
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:32,435
in He first appeared on screen in as a side character and the wise little hen, I believe, and I think

136
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:37,755
I think an Italian artist out tell Ph is the one who

137
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:39,807
may have used him in

138
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:50,115
print first and kind of shaped the character and print a bit, But but that's a good point. Right? Because he's probably going with a bit of the Disney house style

139
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:56,530
early on, you know, that's what you definitely did for the story boarding, the the last one which is base on

140
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,850
story board

141
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,810
work.

142
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,730
But I but I definitely think you can see

143
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,570
him

144
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,825
creating his own style. I I think you'll see as we go forward.

145
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:12,745
I'm excited to have you back for more of these. And I I think you'll see that this art is really

146
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:16,969
not too distinct from what he's gonna go on to do later.

147
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,904
You know, he's definitely gonna

148
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:21,776
develop his own style and

149
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:23,110
really refine it.

150
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:27,134
I I myself noticed, I find the Nephews

151
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:39,994
hue doing Louie. Some... Some of their the panels, some of their cheeks are kind of puff out in a way that I don't think he or other artists usually do, so I didn't notice that reading it this time.

152
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:47,273
But, yeah, that's that's a great question looking at how it's... I'm so excited to look at how this art and his style

153
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:50,027
is gonna evolve over these comments.

154
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:51,599
I will say

155
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:53,634
I guess maybe the most

156
00:12:54,012 --> 00:12:55,909
Barks background I have is

157
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:58,464
Ducktales was very big

158
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:00,834
when I was a kid, and it

159
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:03,791
completely blew up my second grade. I'm gonna say,

160
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:06,548
and we were all

161
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:07,966
arguing with each...

162
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:12,077
Each other over what we thought the lyrics of the theme song said,

163
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:19,923
which is hard to decipher as a seven year old or whatever we were. But I do recognize I do recognize the art style just kind of the way

164
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,626
the way the line's kind of bend and the way like, their feet bend as they're walking and everything it's very fluid

165
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:33,360
And and it is very much the same style that we get in the cartoon show forty years after this. Forty five years.

166
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,573
You're definitely right. Right? This showed took a lot of

167
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:41,609
notes from the comic. It's based largely on it.

168
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:44,940
Something to know is that

169
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,300
I think the shows

170
00:13:47,640 --> 00:14:00,546
it ranges from being well liked tolerated by Barks fans. I of course, loved it growing up as a kid. And I discovered Ducktales and Barks comments around the same time. I probably started watching

171
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:06,351
the show within a couple of months after I'd read my first few Barks comics.

172
00:14:07,608 --> 00:14:13,390
But yeah, they're not they're not really that well loved among the the comics fans,

173
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:17,216
which, you know, is kinda to be expected because

174
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:21,418
they make a lot of concessions for Saturday morning.

175
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:30,097
Which is to say we're definitely gonna talk in these podcasts about things that the episodes might have used,

176
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:39,247
but it's it's not gonna be a a major emphasis of it because it's just not what Barks fans are really that into.

177
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:47,535
Yeah. But but again, I'm not I'm not proud to admit too proud to admit that I've still enjoy both both of the

178
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:51,495
iterations of the show. Any other thoughts or questions

179
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:52,535
before

180
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:55,664
we talk about the the story beats and the plot?

181
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:04,375
No. I don't think so. Excellent. Let's do it. So I'm... I'm gonna go through. I've mentioned to you when we were planning for this that this was a challenging

182
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,895
part segment for me last time,

183
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:14,739
because Donald Duck finds Pirate gold was you know, it was like the cartoon story board that was based on. It wasn't.

184
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:20,018
It was very hard to summarize. Was very slaps. This one is much more

185
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,691
well plotted,

186
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:25,415
I think. So I'm gonna go through page five page.

187
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:34,785
And summarize the major and important story beats but feel free to chime in if you have something to say. You wanna talk about it by all needs.

188
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:36,265
So

189
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:40,585
the beginning of Donald duck Donald Duck and the monies ring, we

190
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:42,025
see the Nephews

191
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,414
our Pest doll is reading the morning paper.

192
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:51,645
Donald is reading about an a museum exhibit

193
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:59,389
that says the headline says Bay da sends two emi series to bring back mum of his and ancestors.

194
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:02,180
So the nephews have decided

195
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:05,091
to go to the museum and see the mum

196
00:16:05,986 --> 00:16:12,195
and Donald reveals that it's gonna be their last chance because the mum are gonna get moved taken away the next day.

197
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,215
There is a reference

198
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:17,830
to purse that's been placed on

199
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,790
anyone disturbing the monies,

200
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:20,750
which

201
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,523
I've got imagine it's not the the old cliche

202
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:26,281
for us that it is

203
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,935
at this time by by now, but I compared to Barks when this was written.

204
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:34,720
It was probably in that boris car movie you mentioned. Right?

205
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:42,591
Yeah. I I've never actually seen... But I think every... Every money movie is about a purse. Right and upsetting the tune. Right.

206
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:46,861
So on the way to museum, so we're on page two on the way to the museum,

207
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:49,016
they get Barks and by

208
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:58,460
sc looking. I think you can only describe miss Bum. A guy who's trying to sell them a elegant ring worth fifty dollars

209
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:00,351
guy very persuasive.

210
00:17:01,406 --> 00:17:01,906
Donald

211
00:17:02,283 --> 00:17:12,414
declines the ring and the guy just goes ahead and gives it to him. And he alluded to having bad luck ever since he swiped it.

212
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:21,847
So they take a look at the ring and they noticed that it's got a symbol of three serpents on it and they assume that maybe it belong to one of those mum.

213
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,490
And this is the moment when the peak look alike

214
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,730
approaches from behind them and starts to harass them

215
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,870
about the ring.

216
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,210
He

217
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,010
starts

218
00:17:35,444 --> 00:17:40,220
to man handle, Donald. He's gonna take the ring, but the nephews

219
00:17:41,118 --> 00:17:52,815
intervene by poking a hot risk of peanuts stand in them and they get away. They figure this has gotta be the mummy ring because they're seeing bad luck from what they supposed purse.

220
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:54,215
Donald skeptical,

221
00:17:54,595 --> 00:18:00,068
but Huey, has put the ring on and it is stuck on his finger.

222
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:06,974
He definitely never played any dungeons dragons because you know don't just put a random ring on your finger.

223
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:09,982
It might be cursed and you might never to take it off again.

224
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:11,019
I also...

225
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:16,242
I thought it was interesting another thought I had was after reading the first issue that you read with Eric

226
00:18:16,938 --> 00:18:17,930
and it ends with them

227
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:32,909
being rich beyond their wildest streams from all the treasure they found. And here, they're just walking around. He doesn't wanna blow fifty cents on u I'm gonna ring this worth fifty dollars, and I was wondering about continuity and when continuity was invented.

228
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,594
These are very side. There's very little continuity

229
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:38,870
in these,

230
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:42,178
you know, Barks himself was kind of working anonymously.

231
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:43,910
There was never any, like,

232
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:58,729
idea that he was going to get to... You know, you know, there are not gonna be any, like, continued in the next story story lines. There's definitely no marvel cinematic universe. To this. So there there will be characters

233
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:06,295
that are likes and he's gonna come back too, but he just figures that out very organically. It's like so many shows like the Simpsons

234
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:07,215
where

235
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:18,385
they kinda etch sketch things back to the status quo. I also Al struck by how different Donald is in these issues. From my perception of what Donald is as a character.

236
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:23,260
And I I think of him as more kind of a goofy like character

237
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,820
kind of fumbling around and and kind of hap

238
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:38,850
And then this he's like this tough street was you know, a working class guy, and I think the first thing he says in this issue is he's working on improving his mind

239
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:43,524
which seems like... It doesn't seem like something, you know, nineteen sixties

240
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:49,808
Donald duck would say in a in a disney car too, you know. Definitely. I I love this because,

241
00:19:50,226 --> 00:20:06,730
you know, I'm so used to these. This so this is the default donald for me. But I love hearing the things that come to mind for you as your for the first time. This is what people really like about the Barks version of Donald. You know, he's more of every man.

242
00:20:07,348 --> 00:20:08,346
He's not the like,

243
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:15,326
simmering all of vid. You know, he's got a temper these definitely he's gonna fly off the handle.

244
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:18,116
I... I'm struck by... I mean, even

245
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:20,366
when Pete or whoever this is,

246
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:25,704
is picking him up and, like, has him up off the ground holding him by the neck with two hands

247
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:30,168
and he's saying, what did you do with the ring, and Donald says perfect.

248
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,660
Because he's just like this tough. He he slips it to Huey, behind his back while he's talking to pete.

249
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,034
I think in and sort of this post depression

250
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:41,113
storytelling.

251
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:46,986
Americans really liked their characters to be very scrap, you know? And

252
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:48,918
self reliant.

253
00:20:49,256 --> 00:21:07,515
Donald got a lot of faults in these, but he's he's much more complex than he was. And hey he's gonna evolve a lot after this one. And pretty pretty quick time. Alright. So we're gonna take up back in the museum or they're gonna arrive at the museum. It transitions quickly into the display that they're looking at.

254
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,739
I really like the art. I I think you can tell that

255
00:21:12,115 --> 00:21:15,341
this is one of the scenes where Barks was, you know, referencing

256
00:21:15,998 --> 00:21:18,653
something that he saw because the

257
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,180
the art of the Egypt

258
00:21:21,877 --> 00:21:22,377
exhibit

259
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:32,425
is really striking I like the perspective here. They are in front of a couple of sa cuff guy. I think that's how you plural that. It is.

260
00:21:32,945 --> 00:21:42,500
And they kinda dare themselves to pick in. Side and they do. And we don't actually see more than a glimpse of the mummy that's inside,

261
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,561
but they do see a mummy and they see some evidence of some of a robbery.

262
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:51,969
They see an empty box that they guess

263
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:59,677
course funds to the ring that is stuck on Huey, finger. Then we see that there are a couple of very sinister,

264
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:02,084
looking guys dressed in

265
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,919
peg is Egyptian Ga or behind them.

266
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:15,792
They have to get out of there. So I wondered how much of this was was a con try and still Al the plot move along and how much of it is how different the culture is

267
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:20,713
in the early forties, but that these these random sc can just walk into...

268
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:34,810
They they probably bought a ticket into the museum, but then they just walk into some other wing where there are no people and where there are these mum on display. There's not a security guard There's not even a velvet rope. They just kinda walk up, lift it up. take a peek inside what's going on in here, anything of Al.

269
00:22:35,864 --> 00:22:49,023
I also find it remarkable that Huey, is already wearing an egyptian ring that matches this stuff right now and Actually my first thought as the two guys showed up behind him is he was going to jail now. He's going to jail because

270
00:22:49,400 --> 00:23:03,795
they have the thing open. He is obviously wearing some ancient egyptian and jewelry. And it's very plain that he's probably taken that from inside the the sarcophagus in his story that a bum handed this to me on the street for free. Probably not gonna fly with the authorities. But luckily,

271
00:23:04,213 --> 00:23:06,031
luckily no one apparently noticed that.

272
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:08,266
Yeah. I remember

273
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:19,249
I remember reading as a kid feeling a little bit stressed about that. I was like, oh, no. He's coming get caught. But I think i I think it really is the case that people were a lot more cavalier

274
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,059
about

275
00:23:20,837 --> 00:23:44,197
you know, anti Barks and not that they would have allowed things to be stolen straight out of the museum. But have you ever seen those pictures of people like climbing on the pyramids and just the way the gradual way that people treated stuff back in the day. So on the next page, we find out about those two donald calls them tough looking guys. I'm gonna imagine that they're talking to the museum curator.

276
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:56,999
He tells them that these are the Emi series of the Bay of Al do and he explains that they are the ones getting the mum ready to ship back to their ancestors for homeland.

277
00:23:57,498 --> 00:24:00,535
And they find out that the Bay Al

278
00:24:01,853 --> 00:24:02,913
has been...

279
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:08,845
He's characterized as being soar at modern life and wanting to restore everything

280
00:24:09,304 --> 00:24:22,044
back to how it was and ancient times. So now he's taking everything that he wants under the threat of starting a war. I was gonna talk about this later, but I just... I think it's interesting how

281
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:29,640
when we read this ryan. I think we're supposed to, like, feel like the bay is really overs stepping his bounds. And

282
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:41,583
can you believe that he's acting that way. You know, now we we kind of understand that a lot of the stuff in our museums has really been stolen from other cultures

283
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:43,780
and there's a big rep

284
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:47,056
movement. So I I definitely read that differently

285
00:24:47,555 --> 00:24:49,625
than I did when I was a child.

286
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:55,380
Yeah. My my note I have here is why is the bay of Al so sore at the pill of his cultural heritage?

287
00:24:57,668 --> 00:25:04,150
Yeah. Yep. Pretty much. So at the end of this page, Huey, realizes that he has

288
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:16,542
left his cap probably in the mummy room and he needs to go back and get it. So on the next page, he circles past the two emi series who are just looking with severe expressions

289
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:24,086
that anyone could. And the last we see of him at this point is him looking to see if it fell into the sarcophagus.

290
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:27,932
Cut to Donald and the other Nephews

291
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:29,288
waiting

292
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:48,071
outside and, you know, to me, it's amazing that Adult would like let the kid go back in the museum all by himself, but again, kids ran around from morning till dust back in the day. Even even in our day. I mean, I just... I was only child. I was just riding my bike around the neighborhood by myself. Yeah. Check

293
00:25:48,409 --> 00:26:07,705
and make sure you're back by the time the sun's gone down. I know. I had that child. I had a childhood a lot closer to the one that he was doing movie had. And and, of course, this is Huey, who has the ring on his finger. He's gone missing at this point, the Donald and nephew. The other f user searching form, we see them in museum. On the back page,

294
00:26:08,043 --> 00:26:10,792
there's more sequence where they're searching,

295
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,626
and they're in the room with the sarcophagus.

296
00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:15,143
And suddenly,

297
00:26:15,481 --> 00:26:17,658
it tremble and it moves.

298
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:18,856
And donald

299
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:28,672
runs out and terror after he's just given some lust about how brave he is. And apparently they're too scared to go back in because they think they've just seen evidence of the money.

300
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,484
So they go to report it to the police.

301
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,136
Although it's worth pointing out that after the sarcophagus moves

302
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:42,221
Donald is the one who disappears like a lightning flash and then confused are like, oh, okay. Just.

303
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:46,271
Done is the one with Al clear mon pho.

304
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:47,509
Right.

305
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:51,479
Perhaps there was some scarring event with the mummy when he was a kid and

306
00:26:52,174 --> 00:27:07,960
he's never really gotten over it. And he may not be the the ball of rage Id that he is in the cartoons. But he is the one who feel... You he he does fly off the handle more in these than the nephews do. So they they report to the police, but the police base

307
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:15,233
go with the old diplomatic immunity saw, we couldn't arrest those, men. They're they're just generally skeptical.

308
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:18,524
It's up to Donald and the boys. And on the next page,

309
00:27:19,143 --> 00:27:23,040
they go back and they brow beat the curator

310
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:27,570
about the location of the series. And he reveals that they have left

311
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,570
they've taken the mum

312
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,370
and

313
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:52,124
they've left for their ship, which is called the Amnesia castle. I don't think that's referenced at all and the rest of the story. But they they know what they need to do now. They need to get to that ship. And again, the the cab driver lets them know that oh you're not gonna be able to get on that ship unless you're an ambassador or something. On the next page,

314
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:53,535
Donald spot

315
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:58,969
something, which we find out is a costume shop pulls over and

316
00:27:59,507 --> 00:28:02,260
they acquire some pretty ridiculous costumes.

317
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:04,297
You you would accurately

318
00:28:04,676 --> 00:28:06,774
call parts of this story orient

319
00:28:07,593 --> 00:28:12,223
is probably the term that we would use today to describe kind of the hodgepodge

320
00:28:12,562 --> 00:28:13,062
of

321
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:14,141
eastern

322
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,817
tropes and dress and attitude.

323
00:28:18,236 --> 00:28:20,787
So their address and kind of random.

324
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:24,399
Someone's idea of kind of eastern debt.

325
00:28:25,357 --> 00:28:26,655
Yeah. A very rich

326
00:28:27,313 --> 00:28:27,813
Indian

327
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:29,664
some kind of leader

328
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:39,294
whatever, you know, whatever the equivalent of the Barks would be, I would say he has a sas. Right. And then the the nephews have turban on some reason as his attendance.

329
00:28:39,632 --> 00:28:49,888
So, yeah. They they've never met realization people before, but they've heard about them on the. That's what this costume is. Exactly. Yeah. So they tried to blu their way onto the ship

330
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:58,595
and the the guard sees right through them. I I really like the line when he kicks them out of all the phonemes I ever saw you guys or the phone yes

331
00:28:59,932 --> 00:29:03,663
And so the net have to go with plan b. And on the next page,

332
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:08,146
they just offer themselves up. As as workers,

333
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:21,727
but Cans. That cans. They offer themselves up as stack hands. And I feel like this is one of those historic things where there was a time where a man could just offer himself up as a deck and see the world.

334
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:24,660
Maybe this still goes on in some countries, but

335
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,460
this to me is very.

336
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,940
Yeah. Now you need three references

337
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,900
and

338
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,480
a Linkedin page.

339
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:34,153
Right. And you need to have

340
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:47,593
ten years of experience in this programming language that's been around for five. Exactly. Hopefully, you had some unpaid internships for a while as an in intern while you were getting your bachelor's in in d handing. Right. So So d are

341
00:29:48,211 --> 00:29:56,980
working on the ship. The ship still still at the dock. So their their idea is that they're just gonna get in, find Huey, and get out. And unfortunate originally

342
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:00,655
one of the sees them snoop around and

343
00:30:01,553 --> 00:30:13,460
they asked about the emi series and he tells them to get back to work minding their own business. And this point, the ship has sailed. So they're they're really in it deep. I have some... I have some nephew thoughts

344
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:14,538
Yeah.

345
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:16,651
I've I've noticed they

346
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:18,166
they

347
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:22,011
have statements that they would like to make, but they each make a third of the statement.

348
00:30:22,744 --> 00:30:30,236
One of them will say the first part and the one of them say with the middle of the sentence and one of them will say the last part of the sentence. Yeah. It reminds me of there's some

349
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:34,198
less famous x men characters called the the Step K.

350
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:36,032
Who are these

351
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:37,587
blonde qui,

352
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:38,761
their teenagers?

353
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,584
And they all have very powerful tele powers but they can

354
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:47,146
kind of merge their tele powers and kind of direct it all, you know, in the same place or whatever.

355
00:30:48,319 --> 00:31:04,836
But they will actually talk this way sometimes where without they'll... One of them will start a sentence and the other one will finish it. And it made me wonder if if the nephews here are also tele and if so they should use their tele to find where Huey, is and say, you know, they'll re you his mind to see where he is he's inside something dark.

356
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:20,597
And I also I also thought that maybe from this point on in the story, Dewey we and Louis should each say a third of a sentence and leave the last third of the sentence imply. And just have just have this vacant spot where where he we would have finished it. Very mourn full, kind of looking at the camera.

357
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:21,735
Yes.

358
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:27,604
Yeah. That's great. Maybe maybe they're just too young and they haven't fully owned their

359
00:31:27,943 --> 00:31:37,276
psychic powers. Yeah. Another of those examples where this is just the way that they're written and I'm used to how they interact. So it's a hoo

360
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:41,597
seeing you kind of like, highlight the a thing that

361
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:43,631
is is really background

362
00:31:44,127 --> 00:31:48,177
to me. This is this is how the nephew thought. This is what they do. So

363
00:31:48,554 --> 00:31:54,041
we're on the ship at this point it's after hours, it's nighttime time and and they can go snoop.

364
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,390
And there's a scene where Donald is spine through one of the windows

365
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:00,470
and

366
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,790
describing what he sees to the other nephews

367
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,990
who are obviously

368
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:11,485
undergoing some pretty bad seas sickness because when he talks about the food start to get nauseous

369
00:32:11,825 --> 00:32:14,179
and eventually have to

370
00:32:15,156 --> 00:32:27,964
leave Donald prop up prop up by a chair so they can go throw up. We assume a neat site gag. But by the next page, they're not there to be lookout for Donald. So he gets discovered

371
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:38,210
again by that quarter. And so get put on Al duty, A Al, of course, being the K, the kitchen war, and they have to peel

372
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,184
scores and scores

373
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:41,700
of onions.

374
00:32:42,635 --> 00:32:50,049
And I was confused by the fact that they're crying when I was a young kid because I had never cut any and for.

375
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,716
So I didn't understand that that provoked tears.

376
00:32:56,006 --> 00:33:01,941
I actually thought they were peeling potatoes. Until you until you said, but I see the bag actually says the word onions on it. So...

377
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:10,091
So while they're in the midst of this, it's a very dramatic where the door opens behind them. And we see

378
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:13,283
a mummy just to figure wrapped bandages,

379
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,491
sign only appears behind them raises is fist men sing

380
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:42,263
and stripes all three of them in one fell swoop knocking them out. I was totally bought in when I read this as an eight year old, I was like that some me this is really freaky loved it. This was a one of the scarier stories I'd probably read. Up to this point. Yeah. I my perception is that he i think I my perception is that he

381
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:49,575
smack because all three ducks are in sitting closely together in a row and that he smack Donald head hard enough to kind of

382
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:54,735
bump up bump... The hit hit them Al in row like those like like What just

383
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,015
how you call.

384
00:33:56,515 --> 00:33:57,715
Yeah. Totally. Yeah.

385
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:04,111
So we get a long transition that says minutes past, so they've obviously been knocked out for a while.

386
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:12,443
And they noticed that some sausages have been stool and while they were out, they assume it's some hungry s,

387
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:18,642
and this gives them the impetus to go pro. So Donald is hungry. He gets himself a sandwich.

388
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,054
And while he's distracted,

389
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:25,001
hand reaches out of one of those port holes,

390
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:28,553
wrapped in bandages and steals his sandwich.

391
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,779
Kind of an interesting transition from that like,

392
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:33,235
Eerie

393
00:34:34,209 --> 00:34:38,671
scene last page to this. This looks pretty slaps stick Huey,

394
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:51,680
feed to me. So Donald sees that the sandwich has gone and he wants to look through the port hole. And on the next page, we Donald looking through and he gets an expression of ab

395
00:34:52,335 --> 00:34:53,525
terror and he starts

396
00:34:54,384 --> 00:35:10,792
s and indeed the porter and the emi series come out and see him s with the nephew trying to calm him down and he cries when he's asked what's wrong. He says that the mum, the money, they're sitting up in their case even my sandwich and the emi series look on

397
00:35:11,464 --> 00:35:12,762
in kind of

398
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:19,280
confusion. And, you know, before I go to the next page, I I thought this page was pretty striking because

399
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:27,333
He just looks terrified. You know, it's a really good depiction of fear in this. Yeah. He definitely doesn't look like he's

400
00:35:27,964 --> 00:35:31,931
you know, working a con or, whatever with these guys, he's terrified of something.

401
00:35:32,387 --> 00:35:40,086
On the next page, the series, they are a convinced and they call out for food for their ancestors.

402
00:35:40,664 --> 00:35:50,799
All the best dishes brought out and left near the off guy. They explained that this is something that we we all learn about and grade school that's when like ph

403
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:53,391
were buried that they were

404
00:35:54,127 --> 00:36:00,000
very next to to find food and stuff so they could take it into the land of the dead. And,

405
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,760
you know, they they

406
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,812
complain about their loved ones have lai in museums

407
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,648
in the western world for for centuries.

408
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:10,166
And the Nephews

409
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,898
have a moment of skepticism

410
00:36:13,277 --> 00:36:14,416
at the end of this page

411
00:36:14,795 --> 00:36:17,333
saying they've never heard of mum eating.

412
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:24,490
I'll also point out this even just on this page, you get a good example of Barks writing different voices

413
00:36:24,828 --> 00:36:28,159
to where people talk very differently from each other. And

414
00:36:28,616 --> 00:36:33,118
yeah. Feel like the Emi series have the best English of anybody in this issue.

415
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:37,702
They they talk like, very highly educated people. This one here you correctly

416
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:41,391
correctly uses the past participle of july, have lane,

417
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:55,758
which which pete at the... you know, at the beginning of this of this issue would not have normal donald have... And even the kids, you know, they they use kind of contractions and everything mommy's Eaton, e a i apostrophe.

418
00:36:56,575 --> 00:37:01,262
And and it shows how, you know, all these people are from different places. They have different backgrounds different.

419
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,110
Education levels, which is

420
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:05,745
you know, from class So. Yeah. Most

421
00:37:06,243 --> 00:37:17,614
authors of novels would take care to to do in their novels, but you wouldn't necessarily expect in comic. Yeah. I really... I really appreciate you pointing that out. That's a great thing that I think I just

422
00:37:18,591 --> 00:37:27,282
absorbed, but didn't ever... You know, I've read these since I was eight. So this is kind of part of my Dna, but that... That's a really good point.

423
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:28,916
I think you can definitely

424
00:37:29,493 --> 00:37:31,801
hear their voice says. So

425
00:37:32,138 --> 00:37:33,235
on the next page,

426
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,064
Donald and the boys,

427
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:40,470
they are sent to the bridge. One of the Nephews,

428
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,350
I think it's Louis

429
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,190
explains that,

430
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:49,394
you know, this is clear what's going on now, they're not real mum. One of them,

431
00:37:49,731 --> 00:37:51,468
one of them they've surmise

432
00:37:51,885 --> 00:37:52,780
must be Huey,

433
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,680
and he... He's been smuggled

434
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:18,134
out of the museum wrapped like a mummy. And they're asking themselves, well who's the other mommy they're just there there's a lot going on a lot of the, you know, the rhythm of the story. A lot of the deduct of the story goes on in these four panels where they figure out that the other money must be a kid kidnapped he must be after the ring. And and

435
00:38:19,108 --> 00:38:26,714
in the last panel of this one, Donald realizes that they they've got a time constraint now that they've got to tell them what's going on

436
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,801
or they risk having Huey,

437
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,785
and the kidnapped are being sealed up forever

438
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:34,101
And

439
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:39,480
before going to the next page, you know, I think that this one is really an interesting

440
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,569
really seeing because

441
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:44,486
this could have been much more of a mystery.

442
00:38:44,985 --> 00:38:52,268
Right? And he just chooses to have the the characters figured out even though it was structured like a mystery before that.

443
00:38:52,986 --> 00:38:56,717
Yeah. This was one of my favorite pages in the issue where

444
00:38:57,029 --> 00:39:08,195
for one thing, they're not thrown off ballots at all by having just been thrown in the break. They're just like, okay, let's figure this out. And the three of them sit down. And start kind of debating it with each other. Yeah.

445
00:39:08,775 --> 00:39:10,535
With some pretty sound reasoning, you know,

446
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:17,324
I think, you know, based on their observations, they come to some pretty sound conclusions. I think it

447
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:20,081
makes the more charismatic as the heroes

448
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:22,935
of the story, you know, you want your hero to be

449
00:39:23,355 --> 00:39:26,335
sharp and able to kind of figure out what's going on.

450
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:29,783
I I agree completely. I like...

451
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:34,208
I like that the characters seem really sharp and Ducktales here.

452
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:35,882
I find it really

453
00:39:36,713 --> 00:39:39,090
infuriating a lot of media where characters

454
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:40,048
are

455
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:45,716
dumb for no good reason. Like, this does seem like something they should figure out and they do.

456
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:51,523
On the next page, it's the next day. They find out that the bay... The base

457
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,255
series have already left

458
00:39:53,994 --> 00:39:57,091
So they are realizing that they've got to

459
00:39:57,431 --> 00:40:07,020
risk their necks to to save them and they they dive off the ship to leave and to have a chance to catch up with them and it's

460
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,540
pretty dramatic.

461
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,120
I really like these couple of panels where they make that decision.

462
00:40:12,735 --> 00:40:13,235
Yeah.

463
00:40:13,574 --> 00:40:14,274
I like

464
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:18,149
the the frame right before they die where they show the the tri

465
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,186
sailing away. I feel like is where they really

466
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,519
start to

467
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:26,115
convey this sense of a much bigger world

468
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:28,032
than than their little town

469
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:33,325
and it's full of all of interesting things that we just haven't found yet and it's just kind of this

470
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:34,805
mysterious

471
00:40:35,145 --> 00:40:40,929
parallel world to ours. And I also like how Donald checks with the nephews first. He's he's like

472
00:40:41,426 --> 00:40:43,501
we we have to risk risk our next to save him.

473
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:45,715
And they go... Yeah. Okay. Let's do it.

474
00:40:46,315 --> 00:40:50,655
And that... You're right. That's a great panel, the the Al or whatever. Just...

475
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:57,696
I I love the r in that one. And we definitely, I think feel like we've arrived somewhere else.

476
00:40:58,073 --> 00:41:03,295
And, you know, I think I kind of criticized earlier for orient.

477
00:41:04,513 --> 00:41:05,732
And and there's is definitely

478
00:41:06,111 --> 00:41:17,999
a lot of that in this story, which is the nature of the time. But this panel to me really shows that Barks had an interest in this place and and depicting it

479
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:21,403
in a way that was here and

480
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:30,479
and very loving, I think because, you know, the camera really loves this... The the virtual camera or whatever really loves this panorama.

481
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:33,589
So on the next page, they

482
00:41:34,006 --> 00:41:34,506
are

483
00:41:34,963 --> 00:41:36,181
escaping. And

484
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:42,385
it... It's a big escape actually for just a couple of people, you know, deck hands leaving the ship

485
00:41:42,885 --> 00:41:44,265
because they've got

486
00:41:44,565 --> 00:41:46,679
bullets being fired at them.

487
00:41:47,654 --> 00:41:50,068
They have to run through some alleys

488
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:54,710
where just some of the local stray dogs are nip at their heels.

489
00:41:56,279 --> 00:42:03,969
And at some point, they they stir up a mob that runs after them. So they have to Ducktales down kind of a little Barks Alley

490
00:42:05,425 --> 00:42:05,925
and

491
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:08,319
it can't hide there.

492
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:09,756
So

493
00:42:11,252 --> 00:42:14,520
we we kinda cut away to from the point where they're hiding,

494
00:42:15,057 --> 00:42:15,557
and

495
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:18,987
there is a local

496
00:42:19,365 --> 00:42:21,755
direct the the local police

497
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,151
after them,

498
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:25,325
and there's a, you know,

499
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:27,395
this is a pretty unfortunate

500
00:42:27,814 --> 00:42:28,314
panel

501
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:34,581
where they've dressed as locals and they... The artwork where shows them having darkened their skin.

502
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:37,910
And, you know, they they redirect them,

503
00:42:38,648 --> 00:42:41,466
they're posing as locals basically, and they

504
00:42:42,005 --> 00:42:43,104
they mis x's

505
00:42:43,483 --> 00:42:53,581
them so that the mob runs off. And just Al still all still speaking English, of course. Everybody in this situation is speaking English. As the egyptian cops are asking,

506
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:55,656
apparently, Egyptian fisher people

507
00:42:56,129 --> 00:42:59,583
i I also think... I mean, just the first three frames here, it's first

508
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,430
some kind of machine gun gunfire coming from off off frame, maybe from the boat.

509
00:43:05,484 --> 00:43:07,143
And then the second frame is

510
00:43:07,562 --> 00:43:14,035
dogs dipping being chased by dogs and the third frame is a mob, which is not even in the frame. They're just saying there's a mob after us.

511
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:19,510
And and I think, you know, in anywhere else, I mean in a movie, this would be a ten minute

512
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,090
action set piece.

513
00:43:22,064 --> 00:43:27,119
But here it's just... We gotta hurry through it because we got more story to tell and they're just like here's some danger.

514
00:43:28,017 --> 00:43:31,744
Yeah. And going forward, you know, and it's there's not gonna be this kind of, like,

515
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:37,447
pacing, I think as much. This this is more of a hallmark of the early Barks stuff.

516
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:39,835
So the next page

517
00:43:41,092 --> 00:43:45,144
has them finding a a a ship an abandoned

518
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:46,501
a Luca.

519
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,945
I don't know if that's how you pronounce that, but an egyptian style

520
00:43:51,282 --> 00:43:53,355
ship. Again, Barks clearly got it right.

521
00:43:54,112 --> 00:44:00,455
And they venture up the nile. And this is like the tour part of the story. Right? Where all of a sudden,

522
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:06,750
the the Ducktales and we get distracted and and become sites sears.

523
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:07,787
And

524
00:44:08,724 --> 00:44:13,573
they start to look at the sides, things on the bank of the nile.

525
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,905
They cash their ship

526
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:20,345
and they they lose some time and they have to remind themselves. Okay. We're

527
00:44:20,965 --> 00:44:26,588
dedicating ourselves to getting hue and they they end up drifting that night in a wind

528
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:29,280
period. And then on the next page,

529
00:44:30,053 --> 00:44:30,553
Louie

530
00:44:30,931 --> 00:44:33,585
has the bright idea to hook

531
00:44:34,002 --> 00:44:35,340
onto a passing

532
00:44:36,037 --> 00:44:40,577
steam ship or freighter or something and they make much better progress

533
00:44:40,953 --> 00:44:41,932
up the nile.

534
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:52,719
By the time the other Ducktales woken up. They've made they've navigated three hundred miles up nile and they've approached the base barge off the port bow.

535
00:44:53,097 --> 00:44:54,255
And then on the next page,

536
00:44:55,148 --> 00:44:57,644
they approach we kind of see El,

537
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:08,172
which is a cool looking ancient city. They are approaching as there's ceremony that they surmise is for the return of the mum.

538
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:17,390
And as they approach, they are attacked by a hail of arrows. So they've got circle back and think of another approach. There's so much

539
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:18,350
peril

540
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:21,490
for the kids in this his comic.

541
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:29,030
We have we have, you know, just two pages ago, we had the the guns from the

542
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:33,490
from the, you know, cruise ship or whatever that was, the dogs, the mobs,

543
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:38,290
and now arrows being shot at the kids and all of this is to say Huey,.

544
00:45:38,984 --> 00:45:41,522
Who is going to be buried alive. Yeah

545
00:45:41,981 --> 00:45:43,280
Al as a mommy.

546
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:44,519
And

547
00:45:45,377 --> 00:45:46,996
I think man, like, there's no

548
00:45:48,628 --> 00:45:53,123
I think even when I was a kid, maybe the the cartoons and stuff didn't have this kind of

549
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,055
moral danger for the kids

550
00:45:55,874 --> 00:46:01,528
Did the eighties Ducktales show have, you know, they're gonna get swept off a cliff and eating by sharks or something?

551
00:46:02,147 --> 00:46:06,634
I mean, I I don't think there was this much like human directed violence. You know?

552
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:10,247
I don't think I think these older comics,

553
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:12,561
especially in, like, the forties

554
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:42,786
and and so forth, we're a lot more violent in that kind of like, you know, with fist and knives and stuff like that. I I I'd like to I like to tell people about the old Mickey mouse comics and and how how incredibly roi. Those are. But, you know, you were talking about the the Hay code before we started recording. And I don't know if you wanted to to mention that or if you were saving that powder for for later.

555
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:51,303
Yeah. I I was thinking when I was reading it, I was thinking about, you know, there's a lot of this is some kind of rough stuff and

556
00:46:51,801 --> 00:46:56,576
I was thinking... Is this violate the the Comics code Authority? And so I looked up

557
00:46:57,329 --> 00:47:03,390
when that was, and that code is from nineteen fifty four, this comic of course is from nineteen forty three, as you mentioned,

558
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:04,967
So we still haven't

559
00:47:05,424 --> 00:47:06,642
gotten to this kind of

560
00:47:07,714 --> 00:47:12,090
regulation of of the comics for people who maybe don't don't read as many comics, it's...

561
00:47:12,988 --> 00:47:16,165
The government started to get really concerned about how

562
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:18,414
comics, we're influencing kids

563
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:19,747
and, you know,

564
00:47:20,544 --> 00:47:27,200
brainwashing them into to being violent criminals and everything just like rap music did in the early nineties and

565
00:47:27,618 --> 00:47:29,833
video games are doing to us now and

566
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:32,805
every kind of media needs to be.

567
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:34,478
Regulated

568
00:47:34,937 --> 00:47:37,115
for its violent brain brainwashing effect.

569
00:47:37,453 --> 00:47:37,953
So

570
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:40,170
to kind of get ahead of it,

571
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,399
the comics

572
00:47:42,896 --> 00:47:43,396
industry

573
00:47:43,772 --> 00:47:45,389
imposed this code

574
00:47:45,885 --> 00:47:54,024
upon themselves and and decided this would be how, you know, all the comics that get sold in mainstream shops would need to meet these these standards.

575
00:47:55,362 --> 00:47:56,301
Yeah. And

576
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:07,975
alright. Thing to read about it, like, it's fascinating that that attempt on that regulation and and what it did to the industry. And, you know, I I hadn't thought about that at all

577
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:17,121
until you mentioned it and I do think it's gonna be interesting to see, you know, as we approach that dividing line if if that really affects

578
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,560
Barks

579
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:26,624
stories at all. Obviously, the the funny animal books for probably a lot more immune that that wasn't they were being directed at the old, like,

580
00:48:27,623 --> 00:48:28,682
the the Ec

581
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:32,335
crime comics and the superhero stuff.

582
00:48:32,835 --> 00:48:36,475
But I I gotta imagine there are some knock on effects. Right?

583
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:39,670
Yeah. Yeah. And it's... I mean, it covers

584
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:50,804
most of the history of comics. Like, I I tried to find out when it ended. And it started to get a little softer in the in the eighties and nineties and stuff. And and then in two thousand one,

585
00:48:51,184 --> 00:49:07,209
Marvel submits an x force comic to get approved by the comics code Authority, and they said, no, This is this is too violent to some. You gotta take take this thing out. And Marvel just said I don't think we will. I don't feel like doing that. And so they just stopped submitting them and that was how it ended two thousand one from nineteen fifty four

586
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:09,065
that's crazy.

587
00:49:09,464 --> 00:49:09,964
So

588
00:49:10,502 --> 00:49:14,754
we are back to the the next page cuts to

589
00:49:15,571 --> 00:49:17,643
in the palace of the Bay of El.

590
00:49:18,381 --> 00:49:24,768
And they are in the midst of their ceremony they're preparing to bind the case is

591
00:49:25,744 --> 00:49:29,356
outside the palace. The Nephews, donald nephews are

592
00:49:29,893 --> 00:49:31,284
pondering how to get passes

593
00:49:31,824 --> 00:49:32,724
a guard.

594
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:37,844
You know, Donald getting into the spirit of things, I guess, because he wants to make an old egyptian

595
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:40,575
and and he makes they call it a slingshot.

596
00:49:40,913 --> 00:49:42,730
I I know it as a sling,

597
00:49:43,068 --> 00:49:46,043
right, what David used against Goliath and

598
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,689
on the next page. Man, he just absolutely

599
00:49:50,426 --> 00:49:53,360
brings that guy. He's definitely dead.

600
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:57,641
He can't just arrived that big on the side of the head from that distance.

601
00:49:57,978 --> 00:50:07,301
He's not he's not giving back up from this. He's at least not eating solid food and anymore. But but well, there's a lot of peril, it's at least still a funny animal comic.

602
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:09,175
So

603
00:50:09,552 --> 00:50:11,807
they they rush inside after.

604
00:50:12,398 --> 00:50:14,055
They brain that poor guard.

605
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:18,441
And they stopped them in the nick of time from sealing the cases.

606
00:50:19,137 --> 00:50:20,294
And the bay of Al

607
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:21,684
is

608
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:26,444
wondering who, you know, who are these guys and his emi series

609
00:50:27,064 --> 00:50:30,804
indicate there some fools who followed them from America

610
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,455
and they're crazy

611
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:33,292
and

612
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:39,044
he has them captured and he... Yeah. He he does seem a pretty harsh

613
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:52,979
Definitely. His first instinct is... Well, I mean, they didn't even know who was on the boat or what the boat was coming for and they just started shooting here was Al it already. But once once the emi adversary say, these guys are crazy. He says, okay. Let's throw them to the crocodile.

614
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:55,015
So Donald

615
00:50:55,552 --> 00:51:01,724
pipes up and he says that the Emi series can prove that the people in the cases are alive.

616
00:51:02,164 --> 00:51:02,664
He

617
00:51:03,444 --> 00:51:06,719
makes them confirm that the food that they had ordered

618
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:08,679
laid out was eaten.

619
00:51:09,259 --> 00:51:13,519
And then the bass or prizes is emi series by

620
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:15,294
insisting they'd be released

621
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:17,328
that Donald Al least

622
00:51:17,665 --> 00:51:19,799
be released and then Nephews hughes

623
00:51:20,734 --> 00:51:30,794
saying that he didn't attend the Harvard universe see without learning that mum don't eat. So there was a little just surprise moment where we learn that

624
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:34,154
the bay while he is

625
00:51:34,894 --> 00:51:37,474
against a western modernization it's not

626
00:51:38,174 --> 00:51:41,967
through a lack of familiarity. He's actually been educated at

627
00:51:42,586 --> 00:51:52,881
they're analog for Harbor. And he he... Well, his emi seemed to believe that the mum are have some kind of supernatural element to them. The way ancient egyptians did.

628
00:51:53,537 --> 00:52:01,866
Even the Bay who loves Ancient Egypt and once everything to be like that again, seems to me not to. He he seems to be have solely sentimental

629
00:52:03,439 --> 00:52:06,504
nostalgic kind of feelings toward the mum rather than

630
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:12,212
Yeah. You're right. He may not buy fully into it. That's interesting. He he definitely...

631
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:13,968
They give him some

632
00:52:14,386 --> 00:52:26,194
surprising depth in in a a very quick number of panels I think. So he on the next page, he agrees yeah, there must be live people in the Barks guy. And

633
00:52:27,254 --> 00:52:32,749
then in the next panel after he agreed, and they've gotten their hopes up. His face really Barks

634
00:52:33,629 --> 00:52:49,584
in an expression that I I found really intimidating as a kid and he says that, you know, those live people then can take the place of the ancestors and he insists that the ceremony must continue. Donald is,

635
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:58,013
you know, throwing a hail mary pass. He says wait, the little boy in one of those cases, he he notices the seal of the three

636
00:52:58,352 --> 00:53:02,168
serpents. He says that he's got a ring with that seal.

637
00:53:02,586 --> 00:53:08,848
And the bay is shot it comes to him that this is the ring, the missing ring of the three serpents.

638
00:53:09,544 --> 00:53:14,471
I thought it was interesting that he let to the other ducks go if he's still going to bury

639
00:53:14,783 --> 00:53:18,770
Huey,. He says, I'm going to knowing bury this kid. I know there's a kid in there.

640
00:53:20,246 --> 00:53:23,377
And... But you guys are free to go. You can just hang out here and watch.

641
00:53:24,289 --> 00:53:28,909
Yeah. He's kinda selective about who gets who gets victim minimized here.

642
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:30,109
So

643
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:31,289
on the next page,

644
00:53:31,863 --> 00:53:34,881
he is very excited and he

645
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:37,438
agrees. Let's open the cases.

646
00:53:38,576 --> 00:53:47,061
There's some narration where everyone that that really provides some good suspense here. I think everyone waits silently in the high priests open the Barks,

647
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,612
and we do see two figures,

648
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:55,041
Donald and the audience immediately knows that one of them is hue,

649
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:58,809
and then the other one is a big mummy

650
00:53:59,269 --> 00:53:59,769
who

651
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:03,849
leaps out of the Barks for this and tries to escape.

652
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:06,184
He jumps out of about talking

653
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:11,684
that looks like it would killed him from the fall. And Donald grabs a bandage

654
00:54:12,061 --> 00:54:12,561
and,

655
00:54:13,097 --> 00:54:16,524
you know, we get a class sick mommy un fur. And

656
00:54:17,261 --> 00:54:19,717
we find out as it un

657
00:54:20,294 --> 00:54:23,482
what we... What most people who are not small children

658
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:31,915
guest immediately is that it was the guy that tried to rob him. The people alike, who tried to rob him back in America.

659
00:54:32,688 --> 00:54:35,060
They returned to the throne room

660
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,167
and we have just a really shockingly

661
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,442
deal

662
00:54:39,993 --> 00:54:42,144
con con meeting with the bay,

663
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:48,198
considering that he has moments go, ordering them thrown to the i'll pit

664
00:54:48,695 --> 00:54:52,347
because he is... He's got hue he's sitting on his lap.

665
00:54:52,804 --> 00:54:59,514
He's, like, beam like, like, a proud uncle holding the ring, which Huey, has

666
00:54:59,894 --> 00:55:06,276
returned to him and it's been clear that they have been looking for it for three thousand years, they say,

667
00:55:07,491 --> 00:55:09,905
Huey, reports in very

668
00:55:10,482 --> 00:55:10,982
economical

669
00:55:11,694 --> 00:55:12,194
storytelling

670
00:55:12,814 --> 00:55:13,314
that

671
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:17,634
the thief the Robber had followed them back to the museum

672
00:55:18,494 --> 00:55:20,407
saw him trying to get the ring.

673
00:55:21,144 --> 00:55:22,403
And basically,

674
00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:25,357
when he heard someone else coming into the room,

675
00:55:26,294 --> 00:55:30,644
stash Huey, and himself into the struck off for this and then was forced

676
00:55:31,464 --> 00:55:31,964
to

677
00:55:32,304 --> 00:55:34,124
disguise himself as a mummy.

678
00:55:34,544 --> 00:55:38,375
He was just really in the wrong wrong place at the wrong time.

679
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:48,094
Huey, mentions that, yeah. Now now he had to keep me fed so that he would only be guilty of Kid app rather than murders, which is why they were

680
00:55:48,794 --> 00:55:50,814
sealing food on the ship of course.

681
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:54,144
So lot of storytelling on this page, a lot of

682
00:55:54,482 --> 00:56:00,365
quick resolution here. Any thoughts. It's interesting that here we couldn't get the ring off then, but

683
00:56:01,181 --> 00:56:03,571
seems to pop it off now out of frame

684
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:07,920
yeah to give to give to the bay. Oh lost a little bit of less doesn't...

685
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:12,879
It's probably true. That's actually not a bad not a bad idea the

686
00:56:13,335 --> 00:56:14,831
the winnie the poo method of

687
00:56:15,287 --> 00:56:15,787
getting

688
00:56:16,403 --> 00:56:17,239
getting un stuck.

689
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:21,629
That's right. Yeah. And and again, just the bay has

690
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:26,518
has become this teddy bear in this span of time, which

691
00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:30,993
I I noticed as kind of jarring even as a kid,

692
00:56:31,452 --> 00:56:34,684
you know, I I don't think as a kid that I

693
00:56:35,063 --> 00:56:36,082
had expected...

694
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,917
I'm sure I knew that it must have been the Robber, but

695
00:56:40,256 --> 00:56:50,800
I know I went into this thinking it was gonna be there was gonna be a real money in this. So there were things as a kid that I definitely didn't pick up on, but I noticed how jarring that was.

696
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:52,834
Yeah. That's Al that's a hard

697
00:56:54,054 --> 00:56:55,514
character character change.

698
00:56:56,254 --> 00:57:03,289
So the next page is the last one and it wraps up with them sailing back with a a just fabulous

699
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:08,249
treasure that of course is gonna get actually sketched away by the next adventure.

700
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:09,129
And

701
00:57:09,443 --> 00:57:13,652
Huey, realizes that he has lost his cap again

702
00:57:14,388 --> 00:57:20,008
must be back there in the mummy case and they've learned their lesson and they're going to use that treasure

703
00:57:20,346 --> 00:57:27,284
to buy a new one and the last frame they sail past what what are a couple of very famous

704
00:57:28,261 --> 00:57:30,676
egyptian monuments that I have somewhere in my notes

705
00:57:31,372 --> 00:57:36,737
and they're singing hale hill the games all here and just a very nice tidy and

706
00:57:38,207 --> 00:57:38,707
So

707
00:57:39,802 --> 00:57:40,701
that was

708
00:57:41,278 --> 00:57:42,377
that was the mummy

709
00:57:42,714 --> 00:57:43,214
ring

710
00:57:43,991 --> 00:57:44,464
and

711
00:57:45,122 --> 00:57:46,698
Well I really enjoyed

712
00:57:47,035 --> 00:57:48,173
I really enjoyed

713
00:57:49,705 --> 00:57:52,650
na that and and hearing your thoughts

714
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:54,564
as anu newbie

715
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:55,936
going over this.

716
00:57:56,614 --> 00:58:00,234
I want to talk about kind of our overall thoughts

717
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:02,229
about this one.

718
00:58:03,124 --> 00:58:15,179
I think uniquely in this one, the the feeling that I can remember having the first time I read this is a little bit of disappointment. Right? Because this one ends up. It's billed as being about a mummy,

719
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:16,699
but

720
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:23,658
it's not. There's not a real mummy in this at all. It's just some crook in the disguise.

721
00:58:24,075 --> 00:58:26,728
And And the there was a mummy in the sarcophagus

722
00:58:27,385 --> 00:58:34,053
Right. You know, when the at the at the start of the frame and I assume it's been shoved into a garbage canyon in the so that by pete.

723
00:58:35,192 --> 00:58:39,184
But there was no living mummy that that walked around

724
00:58:40,084 --> 00:58:41,624
and had a purse or anything.

725
00:58:41,924 --> 00:58:42,424
So,

726
00:58:43,364 --> 00:58:54,719
you know, that was what I kinda took from this one was a little bit of buyers or more so oh, man, you know, that... That's kind of Al let down. But I I came back to this and I reread it many times.

727
00:58:55,219 --> 00:58:57,134
I think without without knowing

728
00:58:57,555 --> 00:59:00,815
until much later that this was the very first

729
00:59:01,354 --> 00:59:02,374
fully plotted

730
00:59:03,114 --> 00:59:05,469
fully drawn bar story.

731
00:59:05,848 --> 00:59:06,348
And

732
00:59:06,846 --> 00:59:10,023
I I really came to appreciate this one over the years,

733
00:59:10,521 --> 00:59:13,752
and I have A make much more appreciation

734
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:16,589
for now. I I really enjoyed

735
00:59:17,047 --> 00:59:17,547
the

736
00:59:17,966 --> 00:59:19,065
the story elements

737
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:20,119
and

738
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:25,739
just the plotting and a lot of the way that Barks

739
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:27,815
into rated,

740
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:30,335
you know, egyptian,

741
00:59:30,874 --> 00:59:31,974
lore and

742
00:59:32,474 --> 00:59:34,174
egyptian culture and

743
00:59:34,795 --> 00:59:38,464
you know, it... It really does feel like the travel log once they get there.

744
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,700
So

745
00:59:40,595 --> 00:59:46,452
really enjoyed this one even if I felt like I I was mis direct it a little bit.

746
00:59:47,469 --> 00:59:51,720
I'm I'm really curious about your your thoughts because I can't remember

747
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,569
you reading one of these

748
00:59:54,029 --> 00:59:57,205
and really engaging with it. So so what did you think

749
00:59:57,544 --> 00:59:59,322
overall of the mom ring?

750
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:00,840
I thought it was cool.

751
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:04,974
In the modern day, they would have stretched this over a few issues probably.

752
01:00:05,994 --> 01:00:06,494
This

753
01:00:07,034 --> 01:00:08,194
Indiana Jones ask

754
01:00:08,634 --> 01:00:10,789
International Treasure Hunt perilous

755
01:00:11,488 --> 01:00:11,988
adventure

756
01:00:12,327 --> 01:00:12,827
rescue.

757
01:00:13,165 --> 01:00:13,985
And and

758
01:00:14,524 --> 01:00:17,780
I think you know, when I when I first read over it, I was thinking

759
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,501
You know, this is this is kind of a possibly

760
01:00:21,878 --> 01:00:23,453
problematic view of this

761
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:25,019
this

762
01:00:25,517 --> 01:00:28,648
egyptian leader who is very backward looking.

763
01:00:29,861 --> 01:00:32,651
And then on the second reader, I realized,

764
01:00:33,983 --> 01:00:37,579
Carl marx really just wanted a story to take place in ancient Egypt.

765
01:00:37,979 --> 01:00:44,846
Just wanted to write an adventure that happens in ancient Egypt. But he didn't want to come up with some time travel rules or anything.

766
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:51,495
So Huey,. You know, he gave one frame to he's, you know, he doesn't like the modern world. He likes things

767
01:00:51,955 --> 01:00:52,775
in in

768
01:00:53,155 --> 01:00:56,415
a little more traditional. And and that way we were able to get the

769
01:00:56,795 --> 01:01:00,062
the kind of eventually the Barks wanted. I was impressed at how capable

770
01:01:00,878 --> 01:01:08,895
Donald is Al as the hero here. Like, even in this last frame, they're they're plainly still like sailing up the nile and this little,

771
01:01:09,474 --> 01:01:09,635
you know,

772
01:01:10,675 --> 01:01:12,015
three man sailboat boat.

773
01:01:12,795 --> 01:01:15,347
They're apparently going to sail this across the Atlantic

774
01:01:17,398 --> 01:01:25,210
back back to their hometown. And I mean, he is in a little sailor out of it. And a couple pages ago, he was

775
01:01:25,987 --> 01:01:27,884
repairing a boat that wrecked

776
01:01:28,502 --> 01:01:31,876
and it seems like he has some real skills. He's not just some

777
01:01:32,269 --> 01:01:33,447
some goof that's

778
01:01:34,263 --> 01:01:35,920
doing his best or whatever. He

779
01:01:36,417 --> 01:01:38,991
he has some abilities and he's leveraging them to try and

780
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:40,959
reaches his objectives here.

781
01:01:41,376 --> 01:01:46,510
Yeah. And and again, I I've gotta think that after the depression, this is just kind of like

782
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:50,146
what Americans felt like they could do,

783
01:01:50,525 --> 01:02:13,641
you know, they they and long enough needing to to make do. We'll we'll take a moment for kind of final thoughts. But before before we do that, there's just a few other reflections that I want to to do... I I'd love to talk a little bit kind of specifically. We we touched on how it holds up. Like I said, there's some some problematic

784
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:15,279
depictions in this.

785
01:02:15,938 --> 01:02:18,410
I think for the most part, this

786
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:19,650
is

787
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:20,970
generally

788
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:21,970
respectful

789
01:02:22,349 --> 01:02:31,613
at least relative to a lot of of media of this time. You know, obviously, there are some things that wouldn't be shown were presented

790
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:32,590
today.

791
01:02:33,308 --> 01:02:33,808
But,

792
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:36,940
you know, a apart from just sort of the general

793
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:38,859
eastern

794
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:40,579
orient

795
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:41,700
mindset.

796
01:02:42,174 --> 01:02:43,393
I I think

797
01:02:43,771 --> 01:02:57,630
he he did a pretty good job again in relative terms creating on a curve, you know. I think any media that you look Al from this time is probably going to look pretty dated with some attitudes

798
01:02:58,130 --> 01:02:58,630
towards

799
01:02:59,104 --> 01:02:59,604
words

800
01:03:00,063 --> 01:03:02,100
people from the east.

801
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:14,904
But apart from looking at, you know, stuff that might be problematic I also think it might be interesting to highlight some things that are just out of time. Right? Some some things that are interest stanley

802
01:03:15,204 --> 01:03:19,904
dated it now. And and I noticed... I don't know if you remember at the beginning of the story.

803
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:30,213
Donald references doing all his at the five and ten when he's getting mug by pete. I I didn't know what a five and ten was. Did you catch that?

804
01:03:31,603 --> 01:03:33,781
I I've always assumed it was,

805
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,956
you know, some kind of thrift shop or a pawns shop.

806
01:03:37,636 --> 01:03:48,384
Yeah. I I it up. And a five and ten is what you might think it is. It's where everything costs either a nickel or a dime. So it's basically an old school dollar store. I noticed

807
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:49,704
I

808
01:03:50,005 --> 01:03:51,505
I made note of

809
01:03:51,964 --> 01:03:56,398
when they miss misspelled kidnapped the first time they said kidnapped in the museum.

810
01:03:57,136 --> 01:03:57,636
And

811
01:03:58,213 --> 01:04:03,144
then they spelled it the same way on the next page and the next page. And here at the end when then we were

812
01:04:03,562 --> 01:04:04,994
doing our exposition dump

813
01:04:05,652 --> 01:04:07,309
you know, he was still a kid neighbor

814
01:04:07,686 --> 01:04:08,524
with one p.

815
01:04:09,162 --> 01:04:11,377
And and I thought maybe this is just

816
01:04:11,754 --> 01:04:16,416
an old time way of writing right. Yeah. I noticed that this time as well. I also,

817
01:04:16,992 --> 01:04:21,319
you know, had to look up the song because I've I've heard those statues of Song Lyrics

818
01:04:22,214 --> 01:04:23,524
a few times, but

819
01:04:24,184 --> 01:04:28,164
Hale the gangs all here what they're seeing at the end, which is very appropriate.

820
01:04:28,944 --> 01:04:30,744
I guess it's from Pirates pens ants.

821
01:04:31,796 --> 01:04:32,296
And

822
01:04:32,951 --> 01:04:39,804
must have been just huge in the popular imagination at the time. I don't think it's something that we would casually seeing anymore.

823
01:04:41,501 --> 01:04:42,721
That's probably true.

824
01:04:43,339 --> 01:04:46,436
I also wanna talk about if there's appearances and other media.

825
01:04:47,495 --> 01:04:52,089
So This... To my knowledge, this was never used as the basis for a

826
01:04:52,509 --> 01:04:54,529
story, which many of them will have been.

827
01:04:54,989 --> 01:04:56,424
But I think famously,

828
01:04:57,844 --> 01:04:59,704
there's a sequence in the opening

829
01:05:00,484 --> 01:05:05,196
that is an homage to this. If you go back and watch the theme song.

830
01:05:05,854 --> 01:05:07,790
There is a mummy

831
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:13,993
waking up, looking at a red glowing ring, and I think that's you know, again, part of the mis

832
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:15,671
because I definitely

833
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:16,510
seen

834
01:05:17,088 --> 01:05:21,518
Ducktales by the time I read this. Even if I read Barks stories earlier.

835
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:24,690
You know, that gave me reason to expect a real money.

836
01:05:25,408 --> 01:05:26,946
There just never was.

837
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:29,541
There there aren't any

838
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,706
I haven't talked to you about

839
01:05:33,043 --> 01:05:34,540
Mark's other career

840
01:05:35,156 --> 01:05:36,932
as as an oil painter,

841
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:37,969
but

842
01:05:38,545 --> 01:05:41,814
that's something that I will highlight in these episodes

843
01:05:42,153 --> 01:05:44,928
if he ever based a painting off this one.

844
01:05:45,306 --> 01:05:48,580
To my knowledge, there aren't any big oil paintings.

845
01:05:49,353 --> 01:05:51,449
Taken from this story.

846
01:05:52,544 --> 01:06:00,249
Do you have any final thoughts about this story? Oh, I let me let me interject really quick because I did forget

847
01:06:00,869 --> 01:06:05,249
to talk about... We talked about how we felt about story, but for the general

848
01:06:05,549 --> 01:06:05,824
consensus

849
01:06:06,643 --> 01:06:12,578
I like to take a look at there's a website called Index, i d u c k s

850
01:06:12,957 --> 01:06:16,828
that's kind of Al aggregate where they rate all of the

851
01:06:17,286 --> 01:06:24,353
Disney stories is they let users rate them. So they get a pretty good critical consensus for many of these stories.

852
01:06:24,932 --> 01:06:35,400
And this one had a pretty strong seven point six rating, which puts it as two hundred and fifty four out of more than forty thousand

853
01:06:35,779 --> 01:06:37,759
stories. Not just Barks stories.

854
01:06:38,779 --> 01:06:47,756
That doesn't put it like in the very, very upper echelon, but that would put this as a pretty well regarded Barks story. So I would say that just...

855
01:06:48,253 --> 01:06:55,911
you know, as is fitting, but this is the first Barks story, and I'll let this kind of be my my final thoughts.

856
01:06:57,606 --> 01:07:02,395
The the... This is really the story that set the template

857
01:07:02,855 --> 01:07:06,715
for what Barks was going to do going forward. You know, these really

858
01:07:07,415 --> 01:07:09,715
grand adventures where through happens

859
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:13,450
they get swept up into something,

860
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:15,450
and they have to

861
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:18,663
figure out their way out a pretty big jam.

862
01:07:19,482 --> 01:07:21,620
And along the way, we

863
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:24,058
oftentimes get treated to

864
01:07:24,517 --> 01:07:25,896
some really interesting

865
01:07:26,435 --> 01:07:29,230
x exploration of another culture

866
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:30,390
or,

867
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,605
you know, some some cool aspect of of mythology.

868
01:07:35,821 --> 01:07:38,155
So I I think it was just a really

869
01:07:38,532 --> 01:07:42,182
really fun to revisit this one. And I'm really glad that I got too.

870
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,708
Do you have any any closing thoughts about this.

871
01:07:47,086 --> 01:07:47,786
I think,

872
01:07:48,844 --> 01:07:50,542
you know, for for a debut

873
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:52,100
story essentially,

874
01:07:53,693 --> 01:07:55,951
pretty impressive. I would I would have expected,

875
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:56,770
you know,

876
01:07:57,569 --> 01:08:00,786
any any creators first attempt to be a little bit more of

877
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:07,940
a bundle and we're kind feeling out, You don't really have the right the right tone yet. You don't really have the right pacing yet.

878
01:08:09,955 --> 01:08:10,455
And

879
01:08:12,195 --> 01:08:13,775
I I think it shows a lot of

880
01:08:14,115 --> 01:08:14,615
creativity

881
01:08:15,155 --> 01:08:15,655
and

882
01:08:16,929 --> 01:08:21,545
kind of Al interest in, you know, really telling something interesting instead of...

883
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:24,701
I think a lot of the comics of this era might have been more

884
01:08:26,174 --> 01:08:26,794
you know

885
01:08:27,532 --> 01:08:29,191
I don't know it could have been something very

886
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:31,549
overly tame and

887
01:08:32,687 --> 01:08:36,395
boring because you know, you can sell it for for a dime and

888
01:08:36,853 --> 01:08:41,600
and they'll just buy whatever. So why make it good, but he made it good anyway. Alright.

889
01:08:42,453 --> 01:08:46,509
Yeah. There's a lot of love care that's gone into this, obviously.

890
01:08:46,848 --> 01:08:46,888
Well,

891
01:08:47,926 --> 01:08:50,458
Brian thank you so much. For for joining me.

892
01:08:51,177 --> 01:08:52,736
Really thrilled to get to do this.

893
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:53,795
And

894
01:08:54,533 --> 01:08:57,805
looking forward to having you back for some more of these

895
01:08:59,305 --> 01:09:00,965
So if you

896
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:02,685
have any

897
01:09:03,025 --> 01:09:04,745
thoughts or comments, listeners,

898
01:09:05,718 --> 01:09:10,906
You can feel free to drop us line at Barks mark's at g mail dot com.

899
01:09:11,703 --> 01:09:12,203
And

please join us the next time on Mark's remarks when we talk about too many pets.

901
01:09:19,069 --> 01:09:20,528
Thank you very much.

902
01:09:21,746 --> 01:09:29,990
And this is Barks jumping in one last time. I had forgotten to mention a couple of things in my notes.

903
01:09:30,685 --> 01:09:33,185
The fact that Barks copied some of the landmarks

904
01:09:33,805 --> 01:09:34,465
that he

905
01:09:34,965 --> 01:09:37,305
saw in the National geographic article,

906
01:09:37,685 --> 01:09:39,836
daily Life, in Inch Egypt.

907
01:09:40,729 --> 01:09:48,822
Some of the sites depicted in this story include great sphinx of Gi on page seventeen, the Skyline of Cairo on Page seventeen and eighteen.

908
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,899
The pyramid of May

909
01:09:51,638 --> 01:09:57,630
may do on Page nineteen, the pyramid of Joe on page twenty and the Barks temple of hat

910
01:09:58,090 --> 01:09:58,590
shit

911
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:01,789
on page twenty one and twenty two as well as the

912
01:10:02,249 --> 01:10:03,249
of mem.

913
01:10:04,142 --> 01:10:08,650
And I wanted to introduce our ask kids segments,

914
01:10:09,687 --> 01:10:21,760
so give a lesson. Hello. This is Ryan. I'm back for the Ask kid segment, and I am here with an actual kid. What is your first name kit? Penny. Penny. And what grade are you in? First gray.

915
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,819
Okay. So

916
01:10:24,198 --> 01:10:26,835
we just read Dun duck and the mummy ring.

917
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,507
So you have some experience with comics? Do you...

918
01:10:30,966 --> 01:10:32,605
Did you like this one? Mh.

919
01:10:33,404 --> 01:10:36,361
And did you feel like you understood what was going on?

920
01:10:37,694 --> 01:10:39,849
Kind of? Were there some parts that were hard to understand?

921
01:10:40,368 --> 01:10:41,167
No. No.

922
01:10:41,965 --> 01:10:46,755
Was it scary? No. No. Were you worried for the for the nephews?

923
01:10:47,568 --> 01:10:48,366
Yeah. No...

924
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:50,102
Why weren't you worried?

925
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,398
I don't yeah.

926
01:10:52,395 --> 01:10:54,031
You knew they were gonna be okay? Mh.

927
01:10:54,804 --> 01:10:55,624
Okay. And

928
01:10:56,724 --> 01:10:58,545

Okay.

932
01:11:04,136 --> 01:11:05,614
Did you think the book was fun?

933
01:11:06,651 --> 01:11:06,771
Yeah.

934
01:11:08,687 --> 01:11:09,506
Would you

935
01:11:10,323 --> 01:11:11,800
read more of these? If there were more of these?

936
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:17,264
No. I think I like guys our books bit better. Yeah.

937
01:11:17,682 --> 01:11:18,160
Okay. Okay.

938
01:11:19,398 --> 01:11:20,595
And I like keith.

That's pretty great. Who doesn't let Kitties?

940

Alright.

01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:28,409
Thank you, Ryan, and thank you, Penny. We'll see you all next time.
