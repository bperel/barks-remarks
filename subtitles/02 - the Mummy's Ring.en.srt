00:00:16,825 --> 00:00:17,525
can have

00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:37,878
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks, the podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks, creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and sk comments of all time. Join us, as we explore his long adventure stories in their chronological

3
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:48,525
publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks.

4
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:49,664
Alright.

5
00:00:50,362 --> 00:00:51,939
I Al Mark Sever,

6
00:00:52,398 --> 00:00:54,950
a grown man who likes to talk about

7
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,270
Inducks com,

8
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:57,630
and

9
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,110
I have with me today, if you can introduce yourself.

10
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:07,371
I'm Ryan Bailey. I like Mark. And I'm largely I'm familiar with Dot com.

11
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:13,320
Yeah. So you're gonna be filling the role the newbie role this week.

12
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,400
And

13
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,160
we are going to be talking this week

14
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,411
about Donald duck and the monies ring.

15
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:25,008
So my my background,

16
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:26,526
I am

17
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:33,963
a super fan of Carl Barks. I've been reading the stories since I was, like, eight years old.

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,015
Have

19
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,215
pretty much every one of them

20
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:38,175
and

21
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:49,241
got it in my head to do a podcast to explore them in order because that's something I've never done. And, again, I could talk and talk about them.

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,417
Growing up this is most of what I read. This is most what I was into at least common wise.

23
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:59,540
Ryan, do you wanna tell me a little bit about

24
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:03,013
your background with Barks and con in general.

25
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,765
I know almost nothing about Carl Barks except for

26
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:08,282
kind of his role

27
00:02:09,315 --> 00:02:10,455
being Al an early

28
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:14,975
creator of of this whole world here. I actually didn't read that many come

29
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:15,835
growing up.

30
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:17,535
It wasn't until

31
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:21,060
like the two thousand eight recession. I was

32
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:24,047
I was well into a adulthood, and

33
00:02:24,663 --> 00:02:31,114
I had a lot of comics that I gotten from a friend and I just started reading them at night, and I was like, oh, I really like this.

34
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:32,549
So

35
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:40,191
for last two years I've had, like, the Marvel unlimited subscription and everything, and I've actually keep track of what i've read. I recently passed four thousand

36
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:42,042
issues of Marvel

37
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:43,737
in the last five years.

38
00:02:44,694 --> 00:02:46,631
So I usually read about a thousand

39
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:49,919
comments a year, but almost exclusively marble.

40
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:55,552
Not necessarily with the the quote funny animal comics. Yes. Exactly.

41
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,165
I'm

42
00:02:58,342 --> 00:03:01,116
in at least a couple of the Dot com,

43
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:07,357
the super superhero ones are are lamp a little bit so super snoop. So

44
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:09,472
that's awesome. I I

45
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:15,395
Al glad that you got a chance because, you know, you and I have known each other for

46
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:19,795
since the beginning of high school, we've been friends for a long time.

47
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:24,530
And I mean, you probably heard me talk about these a lot.

48
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,050
I I don't remember if I lobby you

49
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,730
to read them or give them a try. Do you remember if you ever gave them any any try?

50
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:43,470
I don't recall ever actually sitting down and and reading one. I'm sure there must have been some point probably in high school where you were you, you know, thrust it into my lap and was like, read this.

51
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,550
It's amazing. And then I probably did And was like, yeah. That's pretty good.

52
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:59,906
You know, for someone who's such a big fan, I've I've actually always been really reluctant to trust or voice them on people because I think there's always a little bit of of embarrassment

53
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:03,022
misplaced, but

54
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,835
nonetheless, a little bit of embarrassment about about what they are and, you know, growing up, it was definitely

55
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:11,315
cooler to be into the marvel

56
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:26,927
or other superhero comments. My I read some of those too but these beads were my first love. It's very exciting to me to kinda talk about them in the real world and to have this built in excuse to make the people that I know

57
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:37,009
give them a shot. I am gonna go over some of the details about this story. This one, again, as mentioned is called Donald Duck, and the mum ring,

58
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,502
and this is

59
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:43,505
This was published in September of nineteen

60
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:49,007
forty three This was originally published in for color number twenty nine.

61
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:55,595
It has been reprinted many many times I I think most famously though, it was

62
00:04:57,095 --> 00:05:02,355
The cover art for the very well received Coral Barks in color library

63
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:16,630
The interesting thing about this story, know that last episode, I had Eric on who you... Were we're mutual friends. You know, him well, and we talked about the first Barks story, but that was kind of a,

64
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:22,337
I think because Donald Inducks finds pirate is only partly a Carl Barks

65
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:29,041
story. It was based on a cartoon script. It was not written by Barks was only partially

66
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:32,389
done by him. So this is really the first

67
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:33,266
opportunity

68
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:50,544
to get into a Carl Barks story that is a hundred percent his this was created entirely by him and so this represents kind of an early look at his his independent style What he would go on to do.

69
00:05:51,281 --> 00:06:01,446
Before we get into the story and our thoughts I'd love to take a moment to kind of go back in time a bit and talk about what was going on, what what our historical

70
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:02,660
context is.

71
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:20,392
There's gonna be a few of these stories around this era that are... You can't escape the fact that were in the the side of world war two still. We've got I I checked on with Wikipedia. This is about when Jack and these tournaments

72
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:25,476
really began in earnest. So there's a a pretty sad fact for you.

73
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:29,980
On on a little bit of a lighter note, this was when ride waters

74
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,920
of Pink Floyd and Gloria gay. We're both born.

75
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,640
So there's that.

76
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,995
And and then for the purposes

77
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:39,635
of our

78
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:46,075
podcast today. I think the interesting thing is that the United States and a lot of the world were

79
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:46,995
reenter

80
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,610
one of their waves of egypt of Romania.

81
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,850
Do do you know much about

82
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,525
about these cycles of Egypt

83
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:56,625
Ryan?

84
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,465
No. I don't.

85
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:01,025
I I feel like

86
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:12,945
It's... I've seen it as more as an individual thing where a little kids get really into Egypt for a while, and they wanna learn more about far and all that. And I didn't realize a hold culture did the same thing. Tell me more.

87
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:18,345
Yeah. Absolutely. I i think the Us was one of those little kids

88
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:26,154
several times throughout our three. You know, when every time there was a big discovery, I think,

89
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,810
you know, in in Egypt, since some anti antiquity,

90
00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:32,555
the country and a lot of the world went through these,

91
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:34,669
like, Severino

92
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:36,583
friend

93
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,500
where

94
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:53,537
the Egyptian called are both modern, but mostly ancient was very evo and it entered the pop culture and, you know, this was, of course, you had the the money, boris carl loft, the mommy is the most famous one from this era.

95
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:55,348
That came out in nineteen

96
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,825
thirty two.

97
00:07:57,203 --> 00:07:57,703
So

98
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:04,664
it was... It was a decade old this point, but it it left up big mark on on pop culture.

99
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:07,497
But, yeah. Just egyptian war

100
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:11,740
is something that the Us kind of fell in love

101
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,060
every couple of decades.

102
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,660
So that... That's kind of what this

103
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,832
came out of. I wanna take some time during each so to talk about if there are any notable appearances

104
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,368
wise in these stories,

105
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:31,800
there there aren't really a lot of recurring care directors and this one. You do have a couple of notable

106
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,000
kind of one off characters

107
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,371
in the the Bay Al da

108
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:40,441
and his beneficiaries that will get into.

109
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:47,395
To me the interesting thing is that just like in the last story. You have

110
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:49,708
the old Disney standby

111
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:50,785
villain

112
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:54,174
black pete. Or at least someone who basically

113
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,933
looks like him is kind of the person causes

114
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:10,250
a lot in trouble. Oh, I guess they they never actually named him do they in this coming He's just a guy. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Did did you read him as being? I did. Yeah. That was my initial thought.

115
00:09:10,944 --> 00:09:19,770
Yeah. So I think, you know, early on Carl Barks was just figuring things out and and it's kind what Disney did. That they like we need to villain, we're gonna use p

116
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:33,415
I I really delighted last episode in when I'm telling Eric, one of my favorite Disney facts, which is that peg leg pee actually pre dates mickey mouse. That's how long they've been going back to that well. So

117
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:40,910
I think Barks is gonna be out of that habit soon. I can't remember specifically if we see any more peep alike, but,

118
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,241
you know, hey is it's interesting that he's just their generic villain. So

119
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:52,741
let's see. I I guess this is the first time in one of these episodes that I'm gonna get to go into

120
00:09:53,437 --> 00:10:02,020
what I hope is a recurring segment where we can just talk a little bit about the educational value that was in this story. But I'm thinking

121
00:10:02,574 --> 00:10:06,511
as I go, that I'm gonna kind of wait and talk about that

122
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,028
afterwards a little more reflective.

123
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:18,105
But I I will mention that Carl Barks did something in this story that he becomes famous for, and this is gonna be a great example

124
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,354
that he

125
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,430
famously

126
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:24,142
really loved to dive into

127
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:30,298
national geographic and other sources for some of these stories to get some awesome some background

128
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:37,524
and to really ground it and something that he was interested in. So this is gonna kinda set that template,

129
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:40,920
and we can talk about some of the things he includes

130
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:42,559
by the end.

131
00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:45,076
So Ryan, are you ready

132
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:45,955
to

133
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:47,287
dive into

134
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:49,520
the money... The money rain.

135
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:55,355
Yeah. Yeah. I I I was gonna ask you as the as the expert experts

136
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:57,670
how much

137
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:03,257
how much of this art style and and even characterization is

138
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:11,840
original Barks and how much of it is what he had to continue from what Disney was using. He didn't he didn't create donald. Right?

139
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:15,266
Right. Oh, these are great movie questions.

140
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:22,420
No. He didn't create Donald. Donald had... Donald been around for a few years at this point,

141
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,260
he was originally

142
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,100
in he first appeared on screen in as a side

143
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,395
wise little hen, I believe, and I think

144
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:37,675
I think an Italian artist Al tell fe is the one who

145
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:39,807
may have used him in

146
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:46,955
print first and kind of shaped the character and print a bit. But but that's a good point. Right? Because he's proud

147
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:50,035
going with a bit of the Disney house style

148
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:56,530
early on. You know, that's what he definitely did for the story boarding, the the last one which is based on

149
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,850
story board

150
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:58,770
work.

151
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,730
But But I definitely think you can see

152
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,825
him creating his own style. I I think you'll see as we go forward,

153
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:12,705
I'm excited to have you back for more of these, and I I think you'll see that this art is really

154
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:16,889
not who distinct from what he's gonna go on to do later.

155
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,904
You know, he's definitely gonna

156
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:20,898
develop his own style

157
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:21,736
and

158
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:23,110
really refine it.

159
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:27,094
I I myself notice I find the Nephews,

160
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:39,954
here doing Louie, some... Some of their in the panels, some of their cheeks are all kind of puff out in a way that I don't think he or other artist usually do. So I didn't notice that reading it this time.

161
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:47,193
But, yeah, that that's a great question. Looking at how is... I... I'm so excited to look at how is our and his style

162
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:50,027
is gonna evolve over these comments.

163
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:51,599
I will say.

164
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:53,634
I guess maybe the most

165
00:12:54,012 --> 00:12:55,909
Barks background I have is

166
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:58,424
Ducktales was very big

167
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:00,834
when I was a kid, and it

168
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:03,571
completely blew up my second grade, I'm gonna say,

169
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,508
and we were all

170
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:12,037
arguing doing with each over... Each other over what we thought the Lyrics of the theme song said,

171
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:19,923
which is hard to decipher for as a seven year old or whatever we were. But I do recognize I do recognize the art style just kind of the way

172
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,485
the way the line's kind of bend and the way like, their feet bend is they're walking and everything it's very fluid.

173
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,080
And and it is very much the same style that we get in the cartoon show

174
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,180
forty years after this forty five years.

175
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,573
You're definitely right. Right? To show took a lot of

176
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:41,569
notes from the comic. It's based largely on it.

177
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:47,220
Something to know is that I I think the shows,

178
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,540
it ranges from being well liked tolerated

179
00:13:50,880 --> 00:14:00,546
by Barks fans. I of course, loved it growing up as a kid. And I discovered Ducktales and Barks comments around the same time. I probably started watching

180
00:14:01,485 --> 00:14:06,311
the show within a couple of months after I'd read my first few Barks comics.

181
00:14:07,608 --> 00:14:13,310
But yeah. They're not... They're not really that well loved among the the Comics fans,

182
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:17,216
which, you know, is kinda to be expected because

183
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:21,418
they make a lot of concessions for Saturday morning.

184
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:30,057
Which is to say we're definitely gonna talk in these podcasts about things that the episodes might have used.

185
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:31,532
But

186
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:39,207
it's not gonna be a a major emphasis of it because it's just not what Barks fans or are really that into.

187
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:47,495
Yeah. But but again, I'm not I'm not proud to admit too proud to admit that I still enjoy both both of the

188
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:51,455
iterations of the show. Any other thoughts or questions

189
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:52,495
before

190
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:55,624
we talk about the the story beats and the plot.

191
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:04,335
No. I don't think so. Excellent. Let's do it. So I... I'm gonna go through. I've mentioned to you when we were planning for this that this was a challenging

192
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:06,895
part segment from me last time

193
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:14,739
because Donald Duck finds pirate gold was you know, it was like the Cartoon story board that was based on. It wasn't...

194
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:20,058
It was very hard to summarize was very Gladstone. This one is much more

195
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:21,652
well plotted.

196
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:25,415
I think so I'm gonna go through page by page.

197
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:34,745
And summarize the major and importance for beats. But feel free to chime in if you have something to say if you wanna talk about it by all needs.

198
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:36,225
So

199
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:40,585
the beginning of donald dot, Donald Duck, and the monies ring, we

200
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:41,985
see the nephews

201
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,454
our pest trained donald is sees reading the morning paper.

202
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:51,645
Donald is reading about an a museum exhibit

203
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:59,349
that says the headline says bay bell data, sends two Al series to bring back mum of his and sisters.

204
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:02,140
So the Nephews have decided

205
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:05,091
to go to the museum and see the mum

206
00:16:05,986 --> 00:16:12,235
and Donald reveal that it's gonna be their last chance because the money are gonna get moves taken away the next day.

207
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,935
There is a reference to

208
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,830
purse that's been placed on

209
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,790
anyone disturbing the money,

210
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:20,750
which

211
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,483
I I've gotta imagine is not the the old Cli

212
00:16:25,142 --> 00:16:30,895
for us that it is at at this time by by now, but that compared to Barks when this was written.

213
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:34,539
It was probably in that Barks car movie you mentioned. Right?

214
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:42,551
Yeah. I I've never actually seen... But I think every every money movie is about a purse. Right and upsetting the tune. Right.

215
00:16:43,248 --> 00:16:46,821
So on the way to the museum, so we're on page two on the way to the museum,

216
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:48,937
they get backed and by

217
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:58,420
sc looking. I think you could only describe miss Bum. A guy who's trying to sell them a elegant ring worth fifty dollars

218
00:16:58,854 --> 00:17:00,391
the guys very persuasive.

219
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:02,584
Donald declines

220
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:12,354
the ring and the guy just goes ahead and gives it to him and he lose to having bad luck ever since he swiped it.

221
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:21,807
So they take a look at the ring and they noticed that it's got a symbol of three serpents on it, and they assume that maybe it belong to one of those mum.

222
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:25,490
And this is the moment when the peak look alike

223
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,690
approaches from behind them and starts to harass them

224
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,910
about the ring.

225
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,970
He starts

226
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:35,824
to

227
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:40,180
man handle, Donald. He's gonna take the ring, but the nephews

228
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:52,775
intervene by poking a a hot roast peanuts stand in them and they get away. They figure this is gotta be the mum ring because they're seeing bad luck from what they supposed purse.

229
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:54,175
Donald skeptical,

230
00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:55,055
but

231
00:17:55,475 --> 00:18:00,028
Hue has put the ring on and it is stuck on his finger.

232
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:05,777
He definitely never played any dungeons and dragons because you know, don't just put a random ring

233
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:06,974
on your finger.

234
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,982
It might be cursed and you might Severino take it off again.

235
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:10,979
I also...

236
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:16,202
I thought it was interesting another thought I had was after reading the first issue that you read with Eric,

237
00:18:16,978 --> 00:18:17,930
and it ends with them

238
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:32,869
being rich beyond their while streams from all the treasure they found. And here, they're just walking around. He doesn't wanna blow, fifty cents on u. I'm gonna ring this worth fifty dollars. And I was wondering about continuity and when continuity was invented.

239
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:35,505
These these are very

240
00:18:36,018 --> 00:18:37,554
There's very little continuity

241
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:38,790
in these,

242
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:42,178
you know, Bark himself was kind of working anonymously.

243
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:43,870
There was never any, like,

244
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:50,737
idea that he was going to get to... You, you know, there are not gonna be any, like, continued

245
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:58,689
in the next story, a story lines. There's definitely no marble cinematic universe. To this. So there there will be characters

246
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:06,255
that aren't lights and he's gonna come back two, but he just figures that out very organically. It's like so many shows like the Simpsons

247
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:07,215
where

248
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:09,230
they kinda hs sketch things

249
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:18,385
back to the status quo. I also Al struck by how different donald is in these issues. From my perception of what Donald is as a character.

250
00:19:18,745 --> 00:19:23,220
And I I think of him as more kind of a a goofy like character

251
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,780
kinda fumbling around and and kind of hap.

252
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,175
And in this, he's like this tough street wise you know,

253
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:38,735
working class guy, and I think the first thing he says, in this issue is he's working on improving his mind,

254
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:43,524
which seems like an doesn't seem like something, you know, nineteen sixties

255
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:49,768
Donald Inducks would say, and a and it Isn't too, and you know? Definitely. I I love this because,

256
00:19:50,226 --> 00:20:06,690
you know, I'm so used to these. This so this is the default donald for me. But I love hearing the things that come to mind for you as your us for the first time. This is what people really like about the bar version of Donald. You know, he's more of an every man.

257
00:20:07,308 --> 00:20:08,266
He's not the, like,

258
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:15,246
simmering all of it. You know, he's got a temper in these. Definitely. You gonna fly off the handle.

259
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:18,116
I... I'm struck by... I mean, even

260
00:20:18,573 --> 00:20:20,406
when Pete or whoever this is,

261
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:25,523
is picking him up and, like, has him up off the ground holding him by the neck with two hands.

262
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:30,425
And he's saying, what did you do with the ring? And Donald says I forget.

263
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,620
Because he's just like this stuff. He's he slips it to Hue behind his back while he's talking to pete.

264
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,994
I think in and sort of this post depression

265
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:41,113
storytelling,

266
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:47,026
Americans really liked there are characters to be very scrap, you know? And

267
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:48,838
self reliance.

268
00:20:49,216 --> 00:21:07,515
Donald got a lot of faults in these, but he's he's much more complex than he was. And and he's gonna evolve Al lot after this one. And pretty pretty quick time. Alright. So we're gonna take up back in the museum or they're gonna arrive at the museum. It transitions quickly into the play that they're looking at.

269
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,699
I really like the arts. I I think you can tell that

270
00:21:12,115 --> 00:21:15,301
this is one of the scenes were bar was, you know, referencing

271
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,653
something that he saw because the

272
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,690
the art

273
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,180
of the egypt egyptian

274
00:21:21,837 --> 00:21:22,337
exhibit

275
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:32,345
is really striking on like the perspective here. They are in front of a couple of sa ka guy. I think that's how you plural that. It is.

276
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:42,460
And they kinda dare themselves to pee. Side and they do, and we don't actually see more than a glimpse of the money that's inside.

277
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,601
But they do see a money and they see some evidence of some of a robbery.

278
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:56,807
They see an empty box that they guess some course funds to the ring that is stuck on Hue finger. Then we

279
00:21:57,144 --> 00:22:02,124
see that there are a couple of very sinister. A looking guys dressed in

280
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:06,659
we're meant them is Egyptian ga are behind them.

281
00:22:07,418 --> 00:22:15,752
They have to get out of there. So I wondered how much of this was was I can try and still Al the plot move along and how much of it is, how different the culture is

282
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:20,673
in the early forties, but that these these random sc can just walk into...

283
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:35,151
They they probably bought a ticket in the museum, but then they just walk into some other wing where there are no people and where there are these mondays on display. There's not a security guard. There's not even velvet rope. They just kinda walk up lift it up, take a peek inside. What's going on in here? Or anything of value?

284
00:22:35,864 --> 00:22:49,062
I also find it remarkable that Hue is already wearing an egyptian ring that matches this stuff right now and Actually my first thought as the two guys showed up behind him is he is going to jail now. He's going to jail because

285
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,492
they have the thing open. He is obviously wearing some ancient

286
00:22:52,845 --> 00:23:03,795
jewelry, and it's a very plain that he's probably taken that from inside the the sarcophagus and his story that a above this to me on the street for free, probably not gonna fly with the authorities. But luckily,

287
00:23:04,213 --> 00:23:05,991
luckily no and apparently noticed that.

288
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:08,226
Yeah. I remember

289
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:19,249
I remember reading as a kid feeling a little bit stressed about that. I was like, oh, no. He's gonna get caught. But I think I I think it really is the case that people were a lot more cavalier

290
00:23:19,626 --> 00:23:20,059
about

291
00:23:20,837 --> 00:23:29,842
you know, anti Barks and not that they would have allowed things to be stolen. Straight out of the museum. But have you ever seen those pictures of people like climbing on the pyramids

292
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:38,477
and just the way the gradual way that people treated stuff back in the day. So on the next page we find out about those two

293
00:23:38,815 --> 00:23:44,157
Donald calls some tough looking guys. I'm gonna imagine that they're talking to the museum curator.

294
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:49,245
He tells them that these are the beneficiaries of the bay of Al,

295
00:23:50,125 --> 00:24:00,535
and he explains that they are the ones getting the money ready to ship back to their end such for homeland, and they find out that the bay of Al

296
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:02,833
has been

297
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:03,992
he's

298
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:08,845
characterized as being so at modern life and wanting to restore everything

299
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:11,225
back to how it was in ancient times.

300
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:21,924
So now he's taking everything that he wants under the threat of starting a war. I was gonna talk about this later, but I just... I think it's interesting how

301
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:29,640
when we read this ryan, I think we're supposed to, like, feel like the bay is really overs stepping his bounds and

302
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:37,930
can you believe that he's acting that way. You know, now we we kind of understand that a lot of the stuff in our

303
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,144
has really been stolen

304
00:24:40,483 --> 00:24:41,543
from other cultures

305
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:43,780
and there's a big rep

306
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,056
movement. So I I definitely read that differently

307
00:24:47,555 --> 00:24:49,545
than I did when I was a child.

308
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:55,380
Yeah. My note... My note I have here is why is the bay of Al so far at the pill of his culture heritage?

309
00:24:57,668 --> 00:25:04,110
Yeah. Yep. Pretty much. So at the end of this page, Huey, realizes is that he has

310
00:25:04,647 --> 00:25:24,006
left his cap, probably in the money room and he needs to go back and get it. So on the next page, he circles past the two emi who are just looking with severe expressions that that anyone could. And the last we see of him at this point is him looking to see if it fell into the star sarcophagus

311
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:27,892
cut to donald and the other nephews

312
00:25:28,788 --> 00:26:07,564
waiting outside And, you know, to me, it's amazing that an adult would like let the kid go back in the museum all by himself. But again, kids ran around from morning till dust back in the day. Even even in our day. I mean, I just I was only child. I was just writing my bike around the neighborhood by myself. Yeah. Check in and make sure you're back by the time the sun's gone down. I know. I I had that child. I had a childhood a lot closer to the one that he was doing louie had. And and, of course, this is Hue who has the ring on his finger. He's gone missing at this point. The Donald and the nephew, the other half user searching for him, we see them in museum. On the next page,

313
00:26:08,043 --> 00:26:10,792
there's more sequence where they're searching

314
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,586
and they're in the room with the sarcophagus.

315
00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:15,103
And suddenly,

316
00:26:15,481 --> 00:26:17,578
it tremble and it moves.

317
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:18,776
And Donald

318
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:28,672
runs out in tear after he's just given some about how rude he is. And apparently, they're too scared to go back in because they think they've just seen evidence on the money.

319
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,545
So they go to report it. To the police.

320
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,136
Although it's worth pointing out that after the Sarcophagus moves,

321
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:42,520
Donald is the one who disappears like a lightning flash, and the nephews are like, oh okay. Just kinda fuck out.

322
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:46,271
Donald is the one with a clear Mommy pho.

323
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:47,009
Right.

324
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:51,479
Perhaps there was some scarring event with the money when he was kid. And

325
00:26:52,174 --> 00:26:56,580
he's never really gotten over it. And he may not be the the ball of rage

326
00:26:57,236 --> 00:27:15,193
that he is in the cartoons, but he is done definitely and the one who feels... He he he does fly off the handle more in these than the nephews do. So they they report to the police, but the police base we go with the old diplomatic community saw. We keep couldn't arrest those men. They're they're just generally skeptical.

327
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:18,484
It's up to donald and the boys and on the next page,

328
00:27:19,103 --> 00:27:23,000
they go back and they probably beat the curator

329
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:25,038
about the location of the.

330
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:27,570
And he reveals that they have left

331
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,330
they've taken the money and

332
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,030
they've left for their ship,

333
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:52,124
which is called the amnesia Castle. I don't think that's referenced at all and the rest of the story. But they they know what they need to do now. They need to get to that ship. And again, the the cab driver lets them know that, oh, you're not gonna be able to get on that ship unless you're an ambassador or something. On the next page,

334
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:53,535
Donald Spot

335
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:58,929
something, which we find out Al a cost shop pulls over and

336
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:02,180
they acquire some pretty ridiculous costumes,

337
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,297
you you would accurately

338
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:06,774
call parts of this story orient

339
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:11,784
is probably the term that we use today to describe kind of the hodgepodge

340
00:28:12,562 --> 00:28:13,062
of

341
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:14,141
eastern

342
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,817
tropes and dress and attitude.

343
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,707
So their address and kind of random...

344
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,619
Someone's idea of kind of eastern get.

345
00:28:25,357 --> 00:28:26,655
Yeah. A very rich

346
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:27,773
Indian

347
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:29,664
some kind of leader,

348
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:49,888
whatever, you know, whatever the equivalent to the Barks would be, I would say he has a sas. Right. And then then the nephews have Turban on some reason as his attendance so, yeah, They... They've never met real asian people before, but they've heard about them on the radio. That's what this costume is. Exactly. Yeah. So they tried to blast their way onto the ship

349
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:58,595
and the the guard c's right through them. I I really like the line when he kicked them out of all the pho I ever saw. You guys are the funniest yes

350
00:28:59,932 --> 00:29:03,623
And so the Nephews have to go with plan b and on the next page,

351
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:08,106
they just offer themselves up. As as workers.

352
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:09,581
But Hands.

353
00:29:09,918 --> 00:29:21,727
Jack cans. They offer themselves up as stack hands and I feel like this is one of those historic things where there was a time where a man could just offer himself up as a deck and see the world.

354
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:24,660
Maybe this still goes on in some countries, but

355
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,840
this to me is very archaic.

356
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,900
Now you need three references

357
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:29,980
and

358
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,480
a linkedin page.

359
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:34,113
Right. And you need to have

360
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:47,553
ten years of experience in this programming language that's been around for five. Exactly. Hopefully, you had some unpaid internship for a while as an intern while you were getting your bachelor's in in Inducks handing. Right. So sorry deck hands are

361
00:29:48,211 --> 00:29:56,460
working on the ship. The shit still still at the dock. So their their idea is that they're just gonna get in find Huey, and get out and unfortunately

362
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,658
one of the sees

363
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:00,575
snoop around and

364
00:30:01,553 --> 00:30:13,460
they asked about the series and he tells them to get back to work mine they're own business and this point, the ship has failed. So they're really in deep. I have some... I have some nephew thoughts

365
00:30:13,998 --> 00:30:14,078
Yeah.

366
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:16,651
I've I've noticed they

367
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:18,166
they

368
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:22,051
have statements that they would like to make, but they each make a third of the statements.

369
00:30:22,465 --> 00:30:30,236
That one of them will say the first part and then one of them say with the middle of the sentence and one of them will say the last part of the sentence. Yeah. It reminds me of there's some

370
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:33,619
less famous x men characters called the the Stamford.

371
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:36,032
Who are these

372
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:37,587
blonde qui,

373
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:38,721
their teenagers,

374
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,584
and they all have very powerful tele powers, but they can

375
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:47,066
kind of merge their tele powers and kind of direct it all, you know, in the same place or whatever.

376
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:57,545
But they will actually talk this way sometimes l they'll one of them will start a sentence and the other one will finish it. And it made me wonder if if the nephews here are also Tele, and if so

377
00:30:57,884 --> 00:31:04,936
they should use their let to find where He is and say, you know, they'll re q his mind to see where he is. He's inside something dark.

378
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:20,517
And I also I also thought that maybe from this point on in the story. Dewey and Louie should each say a third of a sentence and leave the last third of the sentence implied. And just have... Just have this vacant spot where where he would have finished his. Okay. Very more in full kinda of looking at the camera.

379
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:27,564
Yeah. That's great. Maybe maybe they're just too young and they haven't fully owned their

380
00:31:27,943 --> 00:31:38,092
psychic powers. Yeah. Another of those examples where this is just the way that they're written and I'm used to they interact. So it's a who's Severino

381
00:31:38,131 --> 00:31:41,517
you kind of, like, highlight that thing that

382
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:43,591
is is really background

383
00:31:44,127 --> 00:31:48,137
to me. This is this is how the nephew top. This is what they do. So

384
00:31:48,514 --> 00:31:54,061
we're on the ship at this point it's after hours, it's time and and they can go snoop.

385
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,390
And there's a scene where Donald is fine through a one of the windows

386
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:00,470
and

387
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,790
describing what he sees to the other nephews,

388
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,950
who are obviously

389
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:11,445
undergoing some pretty bad c sickness because when he talks about the food, start to get nauseous

390
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:14,100
and eventually have to

391
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:22,900
leave donald Prop up prop up by a chair so they can go throw up. We assume a neat site gag. But by the next page,

392
00:32:23,394 --> 00:32:27,964
they're not there to be lookout for Donald. So he gets discovered

393
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:38,130
again by that porter. And you get put on Galley duty. Galley, of course being the k the kitchen were and they have to peel

394
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,144
scores and scores

395
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:41,700
of onions.

396
00:32:42,635 --> 00:32:49,197
And I was confused by the fact that they're crying when I was a young kid because I had never cut

397
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:50,049
for.

398
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,636
So I didn't understand that that proves tears.

399
00:32:56,006 --> 00:33:01,941
I actually thought they were peeling potatoes until you until you said, but I see the bag actually says the word onions on it. So...

400
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:05,980
So while they're in the midst of this, it's a very dramatic

401
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,051
where the door opens behind them, and we see

402
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:13,243
a money just to figure wrapped in bandages,

403
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,091
sign only appears behind them. Raises is fist men

404
00:33:18,989 --> 00:33:42,224
and stripes all three of them in one fell smooth knocking them out. I was totally bought when I read this as an eight year old, I was like that some mommy. This is really freaky key. Loved it. This was a one of the scarier stories I probably read. Up to this point. Yeah. I... My perception is that he I think I... My perception is that he

405
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:49,575
smack because all three ducks are in sitting closely together in a row, and that he smack Donald head hard enough to kind of

406
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:53,295
bump up. They hit hit them in a row like those, like

407
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:56,015
you call.

408
00:33:56,475 --> 00:34:04,071
Yeah. Totally. Yeah. It's So we get a long transition that says minutes past, so they've obviously been knocked out for a while.

409
00:34:05,228 --> 00:34:09,372
And they noticed that some sausages have been stolen and while they were out.

410
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:18,602
They assume it's some hungry still away, and this gives them the impetus to go crowley. So Donald is hungry. He gets himself a sandwich

411
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,094
And while he's distracted,

412
00:34:21,613 --> 00:34:24,961
hand reaches out of one of those part holes,

413
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:28,513
wrapped in bandages, and steel his sandwich,

414
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,200
kind of an interesting transition from that like

415
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:33,196
erie

416
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:48,692
seen last page to this. This looks pretty slab stick and goofy feet to me. So Donald sees that the sandwich is gone and he wants to look through the port hole. And on the next page, we see donald looking through

417
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:51,003
and he gets an expression of

418
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:53,525
tara he start

419
00:34:54,264 --> 00:34:56,842
s and indeed the porter and the emi

420
00:34:57,301 --> 00:35:10,712
come out and see him s came with the nephews trying to calm him down and he cries when he's ask what's wrong. He says that the money, the money they're sitting up and their cases eating my sandwich, and the Emi beneficiaries look on

421
00:35:11,504 --> 00:35:12,722
in kind of

422
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:19,280
confusion. And, you know, before I go to the next page, I I thought this page was pretty striking because

423
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:20,717
He just looks,

424
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:27,293
you know, it's a really good depiction of fear. In this. Yeah. He definitely doesn't look like he's

425
00:35:27,964 --> 00:35:31,710
you know, working a khan. Or would have with these guys. He's terrified of something.

426
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:33,764
On the next page, the,

427
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:40,046
they are a convinced and they call out for food for their ancestors.

428
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:50,759
All the best dishes brought out and left near the Barks off guy. They explain that this is something that we we all learn about in grade school that's when, like, far

429
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:53,391
were buried that they were

430
00:35:54,087 --> 00:36:00,040
very next to to find food and stuff so they could take it into the land of the dead. And,

431
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:05,172
you know, they they complained about their loved ones have lane in

432
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:06,011
museums

433
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,608
in the western world for for century.

434
00:36:09,386 --> 00:36:10,126
And the nephews

435
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:12,858
have a moment of skepticism

436
00:36:13,277 --> 00:36:14,376
at the end of this page

437
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,293
saying they've never heard of money eating.

438
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:28,199
I'll also point out this even just on this page, you get a good example of Barks writing different voices to where people talk very differently from each other. And...

439
00:36:28,616 --> 00:36:33,096
Yeah. Feel like the missionaries have the best English of anybody in this issue.

440
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:37,601
They they talk like very highly educated people. This one here, you correctly,

441
00:36:38,135 --> 00:36:41,351
correctly uses the past participle of july have Lane

442
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:55,719
which yeah which pete at the... You know, at the beginning of this of this issue would not have normal would donald have... And even the kids, you know, they they use kind of contractions and everything Mum Et, ea a t i and apostrophe.

443
00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:01,240
And and it shows how, you know, all these people are from different places. They have different backgrounds different.

444
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,110
Education levels, which is

445
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:05,705
you know, class. Yeah. Most

446
00:37:06,203 --> 00:37:17,614
authors of novels would take care to to do in their novels, but you wouldn't necessarily expect Inducks economic Yeah. I really... I really appreciate you pointing that out. That's a a great thing that I think I just

447
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:27,242
absorbed, but didn't ever... Yeah. I've read these since i was eight. So this is kinda of part of my Dna, but that... That's a really good point.

448
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:28,877
I think you can definitely

449
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:31,761
hear their voice is. So

450
00:37:32,138 --> 00:37:33,235
on the next page,

451
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:36,064
Donald and the boys,

452
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,430
they are sent to the bridge. One of the Nephews

453
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,350
I think it's Louie

454
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,110
explains that,

455
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:49,394
you know, this is clear what's going on now. They're not real mum. One of them,

456
00:37:49,731 --> 00:37:51,468
one of them they've surmise

457
00:37:51,846 --> 00:37:53,080
must be hue

458
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,640
and he... He's been smuggled

459
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:18,134
out of the museum wrapped like a month, and they're asking an themselves, who who's the other mommy they're just... There there's a lot going on a lot of the, you know, the rhythm of the story. A lot of the deduct of the story goes on in these four panels where they figure out that the other mommy must be a kid number you must be after the ring. And and

460
00:38:19,108 --> 00:38:26,674
in the last panel of this one, Donald realize is that they they've got a time constraint now that they've got to tell them what's going on,

461
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,348
or they risk

462
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:29,185
having

463
00:38:29,522 --> 00:38:32,785
hue and the kidnapped are being sealed up forever

464
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:34,101
And

465
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:41,489
before going to the next page, you know, I think that this one is really an interesting really thing because

466
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:44,446
this could have been much more of a mystery.

467
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:52,308
Right? And he just chooses to have the the characters figure it out even though it was structured like a mystery before that.

468
00:38:52,986 --> 00:38:56,757
Yeah. This was one of my favorite pages in the issue where

469
00:38:57,069 --> 00:39:07,775
for one thing, they're not thrown off Al at all by having just been thrown in the break. They're just like, okay, let's figure this out, and the three of them sit down and start kind of debating it with each other. Yeah.

470
00:39:08,735 --> 00:39:10,535
With some pretty sound reasoning, you know,

471
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:17,284
I think, you know, based on their observations, they come to some pretty sound completion. I think it

472
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:20,041
makes them more charismatic as the heroes

473
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:22,895
of the story, you know, you want your hero to be

474
00:39:23,315 --> 00:39:26,295
sharp and and able to kind of figure out what's going on?

475
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:29,744
I I agree completely. I like...

476
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:33,251
I like that the characters seem really sharp and

477
00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:34,128
here.

478
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:35,842
I find it really

479
00:39:36,713 --> 00:39:39,010
infuriating a lot of media where characters

480
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:40,008
are

481
00:39:40,426 --> 00:39:45,677
dumb for no good reason. Like, this does seem like something they should figure out and they do.

482
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:51,523
On the next page, it's the next day they find out that the bay... The base

483
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:53,255
have already left

484
00:39:53,994 --> 00:39:57,011
So they are realizing that they've got to

485
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:06,980
risk their next to to save them and they they dive off the ship to leave and to have a chance to catch up with them. And it's

486
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,500
pretty dramatic.

487
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,120
I really like these couple of panels where they make that decision.

488
00:40:12,695 --> 00:40:12,775
Yeah.

489
00:40:13,574 --> 00:40:14,234
I like

490
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:18,109
the the frame right before they die where they show the the try

491
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,146
sailing away. I feel like is where they really

492
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:22,439
start to

493
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:27,992
convey this sense of a much bigger world than than their little town,

494
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:33,285
and it's full of Al of interesting things that we just haven't found yet, and it's just kind of this

495
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:34,765
mysterious

496
00:40:35,145 --> 00:40:39,812
parallel world to ours. And I also like how Donald checks with the nephews first.

497
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:40,929
He's like,

498
00:40:41,426 --> 00:40:43,841
we we have to risk risk our next to save him

499
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:45,675
And they go, yeah Okay. Let's do it.

500
00:40:46,315 --> 00:40:50,615
And that you're right. That's a great panel, the the galley or whatever. Just...

501
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:57,515
I I'd love the r in that one. And we definitely, I think feel like we've arrived somewhere else.

502
00:40:58,113 --> 00:41:03,255
And, you know, I think I kinda of criticized it earlier for orient,

503
00:41:04,552 --> 00:41:05,692
and and there's definitely

504
00:41:06,111 --> 00:41:17,959
a lot of that in this story, which is the nature of the time, but this panel to me really shows that Barks had an interest in this place and and depicting it

505
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:21,364
in a way that was at here it and

506
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:29,560
and very loving, I think because, you know, the camera really loves this... The the virtual camera or whatever really loves this

507
00:41:30,178 --> 00:41:30,678
Panorama.

508
00:41:31,095 --> 00:41:33,509
So on the next page, they

509
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:34,426
are

510
00:41:34,923 --> 00:41:42,345
escaping, and it... It's a big escape actually for just couple of people, you know, deck leaving the ship

511
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:44,265
because they've got

512
00:41:44,565 --> 00:41:46,679
bullets being fired at them.

513
00:41:47,614 --> 00:41:50,028
They have to run through some alleys

514
00:41:50,525 --> 00:41:54,710
where just some of the local stray dogs are nip at their heels.

515
00:41:56,279 --> 00:42:03,669
And at some point, they they stir up a mob that runs after them. So they have Inducks down kind of a a little Barks Al.

516
00:42:05,385 --> 00:42:05,885
And

517
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:08,240
they can't hide there.

518
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:09,637
So

519
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:14,440
we we kinda kinda away to from the point where they're hiding,

520
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:15,597
and

521
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:21,715
there is a local and direct the the local police

522
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:23,112
after them

523
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:25,325
and there's a, you know,

524
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:27,395
this is a pretty unfortunate

525
00:42:27,774 --> 00:42:28,274
panel

526
00:42:28,852 --> 00:42:34,400
where they've dressed as locals and they... The artwork shows them having darkened to their skin.

527
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:37,869
And, you know, they they redirect them.

528
00:42:38,648 --> 00:42:41,466
They're posing as locals basically, and they

529
00:42:42,005 --> 00:42:43,064
they mis direct

530
00:42:43,483 --> 00:42:45,502
them so that the mob runs off.

531
00:42:45,881 --> 00:42:53,581
And just do Al still all still speaking English, of course. Everybody in this situation is speaking English. As the Egyptian cops are asking,

532
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:55,656
apparently, egyptian fisher people

533
00:42:56,129 --> 00:42:59,583
I I also think... I mean, just the first three frames here. It's first

534
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,350
some kind of machine gun fire coming from off off frame, maybe from the boat.

535
00:43:05,484 --> 00:43:07,103
And then the second frame is

536
00:43:07,482 --> 00:43:14,035
dogs they're chased by dogs, and the third frame is a mob, which is not even in the frame. They're just saying there's a mob after us.

537
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:19,510
And and I think, you know, in anywhere else... I mean, in a movie, this would be a a ten minute

538
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,090
action set piece.

539
00:43:22,064 --> 00:43:27,119
But here, it's just... We gotta hurry through it because we got more story to tell. And they're just, like, here's some danger.

540
00:43:28,017 --> 00:43:32,165
Yeah. And going forward, you know, it's there's not gonna be this kind of, like

541
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:37,447
pasting, I think, as much. This this is more of a hallmark the early Barks stuff.

542
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,835
So the next page

543
00:43:41,012 --> 00:43:45,105
has them finding a a a ship an abandoned

544
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:46,302
a F,

545
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,905
I don't know if that's how you pronounce that, but an egyptian style

546
00:43:51,282 --> 00:43:53,355
ship. Again, Barks clearly got it right.

547
00:43:54,112 --> 00:43:55,428
And they've venture up nile.

548
00:43:56,026 --> 00:44:00,415
And this is like the tour part of the story. Right? Or all of a sudden

549
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:06,750
the the Inducks and we get distracted and and become sites sears.

550
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:07,707
And

551
00:44:08,724 --> 00:44:13,534
they start to look at the sides things on the bank of the nile.

552
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,865
They dash their ship,

553
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:20,345
and they they lose some time and they have to remind themselves okay. We're

554
00:44:20,965 --> 00:44:26,588
dedicating our ourselves to getting Hue, and they they end up drifting that night in a wen

555
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:29,280
period. And then on the next page,

556
00:44:30,053 --> 00:44:30,553
Louis

557
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,545
has the bright idea to hook

558
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,340
on a passing

559
00:44:36,037 --> 00:44:40,577
steam ship or freighter or something and they make much better progress

560
00:44:40,953 --> 00:44:41,852
of nile

561
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:43,366
by the time

562
00:44:43,742 --> 00:44:48,607
the other Ducktales woken up, they've made... They've navigate three hundred miles up the nile,

563
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:52,578
and they've approached the base barge off the port bow.

564
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,255
And then on the next page,

565
00:44:55,148 --> 00:44:57,424
they approach, we kind of see Al,

566
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:08,172
which is a cool looking ancient city. They are approaching as there's a ceremony that they surmise is for the return of the mum.

567
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:12,779
And as they approach, they are attacked by a hail of arrows

568
00:45:13,116 --> 00:45:17,390
so they've got circle back and think of another approach. There's so much

569
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:18,310
payroll

570
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:20,510
for the kids in this

571
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:21,490
this comic.

572
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:29,030
We have... We have, you know, just two pages ago, we had the the guns from the

573
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:33,550
from the, you know, cruise ship or whatever that was, the dogs, the mobs,

574
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:38,590
and now Arrows being shot at the kids, and all of this is to save Hue

575
00:45:39,024 --> 00:45:41,022
who is going to be buried alive Yeah.

576
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:43,240
As as a mommy,

577
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:44,559
And

578
00:45:45,377 --> 00:45:46,996
I think man, like, there's no

579
00:45:48,628 --> 00:45:53,123
I think even when I was kid, maybe the the cartoons and stuff didn't have this kind of

580
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,900
mortal danger for the kids.

581
00:45:55,874 --> 00:46:01,348
Did the eighties Ducktales show have, you know, they're gonna get swept off Al cliff and eaten by sharks or something?

582
00:46:02,147 --> 00:46:06,595
I mean, I I don't think there was this much like human directed violence. you know?

583
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:10,207
I don't think... I think these older comics,

584
00:46:10,864 --> 00:46:12,561
especially in, like, the forties

585
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:27,550
and and so forth, we're a lot more violent in that kind of like, you know, with fist knives and stuff like that. I I'd I'd like to... I like to tell people about the old Mickey Mouse comics and and how

586
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:29,425
how incredibly violent

587
00:46:29,802 --> 00:46:30,560
those are.

588
00:46:31,134 --> 00:46:40,256
But, you know, you were talking about the the Hayes code before we started recording. I don't know if you wanted to to mention that or if you were

589
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:42,786
saving that powder for for later.

590
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:51,343
Yeah. I I was thinking when I was reading it, I was thinking about, you know, there's a lot of... This is some kinda rough stuff, and

591
00:46:51,762 --> 00:46:56,536
I was thinking... Is this violate the the Comics code authority? And so I looked up

592
00:46:57,329 --> 00:47:03,390
when that was, and that code is from nineteen fifty four. This comic, of course is from nineteen forty three as you mentioned.

593
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:04,967
So we still haven't

594
00:47:05,385 --> 00:47:06,602
gotten to this kind of

595
00:47:07,714 --> 00:47:12,090
regulation of of the comics for people who maybe don't don't read as many comments. It's...

596
00:47:12,988 --> 00:47:16,086
The government started to get really concerned about how

597
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,374
comics we're influencing kids

598
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:21,682
and, you know, brand watching them into

599
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:27,200
being violent criminals and everything just like rap music did in the early nineties and

600
00:47:27,618 --> 00:47:29,873
video games are doing to us now and

601
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:33,040
everything every kind of media needs to be

602
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:36,775
regulated for for its violent brain watching effect.

603
00:47:37,453 --> 00:47:37,953
So

604
00:47:39,051 --> 00:47:40,170
to kind of get ahead of it,

605
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,316
the Inducks industry

606
00:47:43,733 --> 00:47:45,229
impose this code

607
00:47:45,885 --> 00:47:52,945
upon themselves and and decided this would be how, you know, all the comics that get sold and mainstream shops would need to meet these

608
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:54,024
these standards.

609
00:47:55,362 --> 00:47:56,301
Yeah. And

610
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:07,975
great. Thing to read about it, like, it's fascinating that that attempt on that regulation and and what it did to the industry. And, you know, I I hadn't thought about that at all

611
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:17,081
until you mentioned it, and I do think it's gonna be interesting to see, you know, as we approach that dividing line if if that really affects

612
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,560
Barks

613
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:26,624
stories at all, obviously, the the funny animal books for probably a lot more immune that that wasn't they were being directed Al the old like,

614
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:29,181
the the Ec Prime

615
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,295
And the superhero stuff.

616
00:48:32,795 --> 00:48:36,435
But I've I've gotta imagine there are some knock on effects. Right?

617
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:39,630
Yeah. Yeah. And it's... I mean, it covers

618
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:50,424
most of the history of comics. Like I I tried to find out when it ended. And it started to get a little softer in the in the eighties and nineties and stuff. And and then in two thousand one,

619
00:48:51,184 --> 00:49:07,094
Marvel submits the next force comic to get approved by the Comics code authority, and they said no. This is this is too violent to something you gotta take take this thing out, and Marvel just said I don't think we will. I don't feel like doing that. And so they just stopped submitting them and that was how it ended it. Two thousand one from nineteen fifty four.

620
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:09,046
That's crazy.

621
00:49:09,384 --> 00:49:09,884
So

622
00:49:10,462 --> 00:49:11,600
we are

623
00:49:11,939 --> 00:49:15,113
back to the the next page cuts to in

624
00:49:15,571 --> 00:49:17,303
in the palace of the bay of Al.

625
00:49:18,381 --> 00:49:19,640
And they are

626
00:49:19,979 --> 00:49:24,768
in the midst of their ceremony they're preparing to bind the case is.

627
00:49:25,744 --> 00:49:29,316
Outside the palace, the Nephews Donald nephews are

628
00:49:29,853 --> 00:49:31,284
pondering how to get past

629
00:49:31,824 --> 00:49:32,604
a guard.

630
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:37,804
You know, Donald getting into the spirit of things, I guess because he wants to make an old egyptian

631
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:42,629
when happen and and he makes... They call it a sling shot. I I know it is a sling.

632
00:49:43,068 --> 00:49:46,003
Right, what David used against Goliath and

633
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,649
on the next page, man, he just absolutely

634
00:49:50,346 --> 00:49:53,020
brains that guy. He's definitely dead.

635
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:57,641
He can just around that big on the side of the head from that distance.

636
00:49:57,978 --> 00:50:07,262
Yeah he's not getting back up from this. He's at least not eating solid food and anymore. But but while there's a lot of apparel, it's at least still a funny animal common.

637
00:50:08,635 --> 00:50:09,135
So

638
00:50:09,552 --> 00:50:11,767
they they rush inside after.

639
00:50:12,398 --> 00:50:14,015
They brain that guard.

640
00:50:14,631 --> 00:50:18,441
And they stop them in the nick of time from sealing the cases.

641
00:50:19,137 --> 00:50:20,913
And the bay of elle Do

642
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:21,684
is

643
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:26,044
wondering who, you know, who are these guys and his emi

644
00:50:27,064 --> 00:50:30,764
indicate there some fools who followed them from America,

645
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:33,173
and they're crazy and

646
00:50:34,028 --> 00:50:37,955
he has them captured and he... Yeah. He he does seem

647
00:50:38,292 --> 00:50:38,930
pretty harsh.

648
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:53,078
Definitely, his first instinct is... Well, I mean, they didn't even know who was on the boat or what the boat was coming for. And they just started shooting arrows Al it already. But once once the say, these guys are crazy. He says, okay, let's throw him to the crocodile files.

649
00:50:53,836 --> 00:50:54,975
So Donald

650
00:50:55,512 --> 00:50:56,970
pipes up and he

651
00:50:57,284 --> 00:51:01,744
says that the emi beneficiaries can prove that the people in and the cases are alive

652
00:51:02,084 --> 00:51:02,584
He

653
00:51:03,444 --> 00:51:06,719
makes them confirm that the food that they had ordered

654
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:08,639
laid out was eaten.

655
00:51:09,259 --> 00:51:11,079
And then the base

656
00:51:11,419 --> 00:51:12,639
surprises is emi

657
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:13,519
but

658
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:17,328
insisting they'd be released that that Donald at least

659
00:51:17,665 --> 00:51:19,520
be released and the nephews

660
00:51:20,694 --> 00:51:30,794
saying that he didn't attend the Harvard Universe see you without learning that money don't eat. So there was a little just surprise moment where we learned that

661
00:51:31,894 --> 00:51:34,194
the bay while he is

662
00:51:34,814 --> 00:51:35,314
against

663
00:51:35,614 --> 00:51:37,474
western optimization, it's not

664
00:51:38,174 --> 00:51:41,967
through a lack of familiarity. He's at actually been educated at

665
00:51:42,546 --> 00:51:52,881
their analog for Harvard. And he he... Well, his seemed to believe that the money are have some kind of supernatural element to them the way ancient and egyptians did.

666
00:51:53,497 --> 00:52:01,827
Even the bay, who loves ancient egypt and once once everything did you like that again, seems to me not to. He he seems to be have solely sentimental

667
00:52:03,439 --> 00:52:06,504
nostalgic kind of feelings toward the mum rather than

668
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:12,172
Yeah. You're right. He may not buy fully into it. That's interesting. He he definitely...

669
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:13,928
They give him some

670
00:52:14,386 --> 00:52:25,394
surprising debt in in a a very quick number of panels, I think. So on the next page, he agrees. Yeah they're there must sp live people in the Barks off guy.

671
00:52:25,774 --> 00:52:26,274
And

672
00:52:27,254 --> 00:52:32,749
then in the next panel after he agreed, and they've gotten their hopes up. His face really Barks

673
00:52:33,629 --> 00:52:49,584
and an expression that I I found really intimidating as a kid, and he said that, you know, those live people then can take the place of the ancestors and he insists that this ceremony must continue. Donald is,

674
00:52:49,921 --> 00:52:57,973
you know, thrown a hail mary pass. He says wait, the little boy, and one of those cases, he he notices the seal of the three

675
00:52:58,352 --> 00:53:02,168
serpent. He says that he's got ring with that seal.

676
00:53:02,626 --> 00:53:08,529
And the bay is shot it comes to him that this is the ring the missing ring of the three.

677
00:53:09,544 --> 00:53:14,431
I thought it was interesting that he let the other Inducks go if he's still going to Bury

678
00:53:14,823 --> 00:53:18,611
Hue. He says I'm going to knowing bury this kid. I know there's a kid in there.

679
00:53:20,286 --> 00:53:23,116
And... But you guys are free to go. You can just hang out here and watch.

680
00:53:24,249 --> 00:53:28,569
Yeah, he's kinda selective about who gets who gets victim optimized here.

681
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:30,069
So

682
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:31,289
on the next page,

683
00:53:31,784 --> 00:53:34,801
he is very excited and he

684
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,398
agrees, let's open the cases.

685
00:53:38,576 --> 00:53:47,482
There's affiliation where everyone that that really provides some good suspense here. I think everyone waits silently and the high priest opened the Barks off,

686
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,572
and we do see two figures

687
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:52,368
donald and the audience

688
00:53:52,705 --> 00:53:55,041
immediately knows that one of them is hue,

689
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:58,769
and then the other one is a big money

690
00:53:59,189 --> 00:53:59,689
who

691
00:54:00,389 --> 00:54:03,809
weep out of the Barks sarcophagus for this and tries to escape.

692
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:05,624
He jumps out about.

693
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,644
That looks like it would killed him from the fall. And Donald grabs a bandage

694
00:54:12,061 --> 00:54:12,561
and,

695
00:54:13,097 --> 00:54:15,726
you know, we get a class sick money un fur.

696
00:54:16,064 --> 00:54:16,564
And

697
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:23,482
we find out as it un referrals what we what most people who are not small children

698
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:24,599
guest

699
00:54:24,936 --> 00:54:31,897
immediately is that it was the guy that tried to rob him the pete alike who tried to rob him back in America.

700
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:35,020
They returned to the throne room

701
00:54:35,476 --> 00:54:38,128
and we have just a really shockingly

702
00:54:38,822 --> 00:54:39,322
j

703
00:54:40,232 --> 00:54:42,405
individual meeting with the bay

704
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:48,158
considering that he was moments ago ordering them thrown to the crop dial pitt

705
00:54:48,655 --> 00:54:52,307
because he is... He's got Hue sitting on his lap.

706
00:54:52,764 --> 00:54:57,634
He's, like, beam, like like a proud call holding the ring,

707
00:54:58,054 --> 00:54:59,474
which Huey, has

708
00:54:59,814 --> 00:55:06,015
returned to him and it's been clear that they've been looking for it for three thousand years. They say,

709
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:09,865
Q reports in very

710
00:55:10,482 --> 00:55:10,982
economical

711
00:55:11,694 --> 00:55:12,194
storytelling

712
00:55:12,734 --> 00:55:13,234
that

713
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:17,634
the thief, the Robert had followed them back to the museum,

714
00:55:18,494 --> 00:55:20,287
saw him trying to get the ring.

715
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:22,443
And basically,

716
00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:25,277
when he heard someone else coming into the room,

717
00:55:26,254 --> 00:55:30,644
stash Huey, himself into the stretch off for this and then was forced

718
00:55:31,344 --> 00:55:31,844
to

719
00:55:32,264 --> 00:55:34,124
disguise himself some money.

720
00:55:34,504 --> 00:55:38,255
He was just really in the wrong place at the wrong time.

721
00:55:38,913 --> 00:55:48,094
Hue mentions that, yeah, Now now he had to keep me fed so that he would only be guilty of kid rather than murders, which is why they were

722
00:55:48,794 --> 00:55:50,774
stealing food on the ship. Of course.

723
00:55:51,074 --> 00:55:54,144
So lot of storytelling on this page, a lot of

724
00:55:54,482 --> 00:56:00,365
quick resolution here. Any thoughts. It's interesting that he we couldn't get the ring off then but

725
00:56:01,181 --> 00:56:03,531
seems to pop it off now out of frame.

726
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:06,923
Yeah to give to give to the bay. Probably lost

727
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:07,920
Doesn't

728
00:56:08,697 --> 00:56:12,839
that's probably true. That's actually not a bad not a bad idea the

729
00:56:13,335 --> 00:56:14,831
the winnie need the poo method of

730
00:56:15,287 --> 00:56:15,787
getting

731
00:56:16,363 --> 00:56:17,160
getting un.

732
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:21,629
That's right. Yeah. And and again, just the Bay has

733
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:25,639
has become this teddy bear in this span of time,

734
00:56:26,018 --> 00:56:26,518
which

735
00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:30,993
I I noticed as kind of jarring even as a kid.

736
00:56:31,412 --> 00:56:34,644
You know? I I don't think as a kid that I

737
00:56:35,063 --> 00:56:36,042
had expected

738
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,877
I'm sure I knew that it must have been the Robert, but

739
00:56:40,256 --> 00:56:50,800
I know I went into this thinking it was gonna be there was gonna be a real money in this. So there were things as a kid that I definitely didn't pick up on. But I noticed how jarring that was.

740
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,514
Yeah. That's Al that's a hard hand break turn

741
00:56:54,014 --> 00:56:55,514
character character change.

742
00:56:56,214 --> 00:57:03,249
So the next page is the last one, and it wraps up with them sailing back with a a just fabulous

743
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:08,249
treasure that, of course, is gonna get actually sketched away by the next adventure.

744
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:09,129
And

745
00:57:09,443 --> 00:57:13,612
Huey, realizes that he has lost his cap again

746
00:57:14,388 --> 00:57:19,968
must be back there in the money case, and they've learned their lesson and they're going to use that treasure

747
00:57:20,346 --> 00:57:21,924
to buy the new one.

748
00:57:22,262 --> 00:57:27,284
And the last frame, they sail past wet what are a couple of very famous

749
00:57:28,261 --> 00:57:30,495
Egyptian monument that I have somewhere in my notes.

750
00:57:31,372 --> 00:57:36,737
And they're singing hail hail the games all here and just a very nice tidy ending.

751
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:38,667
So

752
00:57:39,763 --> 00:57:40,661
that was...

753
00:57:41,278 --> 00:57:43,134
That was the mum ring.

754
00:57:44,031 --> 00:57:44,464
And

755
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:46,698
Boy, I really enjoyed.

756
00:57:47,035 --> 00:57:48,173
I really enjoyed

757
00:57:49,665 --> 00:57:52,650
na that and and hearing your thoughts

758
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:54,524
as a newbie

759
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:55,897
going over this.

760
00:57:56,574 --> 00:58:00,234
I want to talk about kind of our overall thoughts

761
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:02,048
about this one.

762
00:58:03,124 --> 00:58:15,140
I think uniquely in this one, the the feeling that I can remember having the first time I read this is a little bit of disappointment. Right? Because this one ends up... It's billed as being about a money.

763
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:16,660
But

764
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:23,538
it's not. There's not a real money in this at all. It's just some crook in disguise.

765
00:58:24,035 --> 00:58:26,689
And the... There was a mommy in the sarcophagus

766
00:58:27,385 --> 00:58:34,053
Right. You know, when the at the at the start of the frame, and I assume it's been shoved into a garbage can in the that ip pete.

767
00:58:35,192 --> 00:58:39,064
But there was no living money that that walked around

768
00:58:40,084 --> 00:58:41,624
and had a purse or anything.

769
00:58:41,924 --> 00:58:42,424
So,

770
00:58:43,364 --> 00:58:54,680
you know, that was what I kinda took from this one. Was a little bit of buyers from more. So, oh, man, you know, that... That's kind of a let down. But I I came back to this and I reread it many times.

771
00:58:55,219 --> 00:58:57,095
I think without without knowing

772
00:58:57,555 --> 00:59:00,815
until much later that this was the very first

773
00:59:01,354 --> 00:59:02,335
fully plotted

774
00:59:03,114 --> 00:59:04,015
fully drawn

775
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:05,469
part story.

776
00:59:05,888 --> 00:59:06,388
And

777
00:59:06,846 --> 00:59:09,983
I I really came to appreciate this one over the years

778
00:59:10,561 --> 00:59:13,792
and I have I much more appreciation

779
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:16,589
for now. I I really enjoyed

780
00:59:17,007 --> 00:59:17,507
the

781
00:59:17,926 --> 00:59:19,065
the story elements

782
00:59:19,579 --> 00:59:20,079
and

783
00:59:21,139 --> 00:59:25,739
just the plotting and a lot of the way that Barks

784
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:27,815
into rated,

785
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:30,335
you know, Egyptian

786
00:59:30,835 --> 00:59:31,894
lo and

787
00:59:32,434 --> 00:59:33,374
egyptian culture

788
00:59:33,674 --> 00:59:34,174
and

789
00:59:34,835 --> 00:59:38,424
know, it really... It really does feel like a travel log once they get there.

790
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,660
So

791
00:59:40,515 --> 00:59:46,412
really enjoyed this one even if I felt like I I was mis direct it a little bit.

792
00:59:47,469 --> 00:59:51,720
I'm I'm really curious about your your thoughts because I can't remember

793
00:59:52,257 --> 00:59:53,569
you reading one of these

794
00:59:54,029 --> 00:59:57,165
and really engaging with it. So so what did you think

795
00:59:57,504 --> 00:59:58,902
overall of the right?

796
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:00,800
I thought it was cool.

797
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:04,974
In the modern day, they would have stretched this over a few issues, probably.

798
01:00:05,954 --> 01:00:06,454
This

799
01:00:06,994 --> 01:00:07,854
Indiana Jones

800
01:00:08,634 --> 01:00:10,749
international treasure hunt perilous

801
01:00:11,448 --> 01:00:11,948
adventure

802
01:00:12,327 --> 01:00:12,827
rescue

803
01:00:13,205 --> 01:00:13,985
And and

804
01:00:14,524 --> 01:00:17,780
I think, you know, when I when I first read over it, I was thinking

805
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,462
You know, this is this is kind of a possibly

806
01:00:22,196 --> 01:00:23,453
problematic view of this

807
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:25,019
this

808
01:00:25,517 --> 01:00:28,648
Egyptian leader who is very backward looking.

809
01:00:29,901 --> 01:00:32,672
And then on the second read, I realized

810
01:00:33,943 --> 01:00:44,846
Car Barks really just wanted a story to take place in ancient egypt. He just wanted to write an adventure that happens in ancient egypt. But he didn't want to come up with some time travel rules or anything.

811
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:51,495
So Huey,, you know, he gave one frame to He's, you know, he doesn't like the modern world. He likes things

812
01:00:51,955 --> 01:00:52,775
in in

813
01:00:53,195 --> 01:00:56,375
a little more traditional. And and that way, we were able to get the

814
01:00:56,795 --> 01:01:00,062
the kind of event the Barks wanted. I was impressed how capable

815
01:01:00,878 --> 01:01:08,895
Donald is as as the hero here. Like, even in this last frame, they're they're plainly still like sailing up the nile and this little,

816
01:01:09,435 --> 01:01:09,635
you know,

817
01:01:10,635 --> 01:01:12,015
three man sale boat

818
01:01:12,755 --> 01:01:15,307
They're apparently going to sail this across the Atlantic

819
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:25,210
back back to their hometown and I mean, he is in Al little sailor outfit of it. And a couple pages ago, he was

820
01:01:25,947 --> 01:01:27,703
repairing a a boat that had wrecked.

821
01:01:28,542 --> 01:01:31,876
And it seems like he has some real skills. He's not just some

822
01:01:32,269 --> 01:01:33,407
some goof ball that's

823
01:01:34,263 --> 01:01:35,880
doing his best or whenever he

824
01:01:36,417 --> 01:01:38,991
he has some abilities and he's leveraging them to try and

825
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:40,959
reaches objectives here.

826
01:01:41,415 --> 01:01:46,510
Yeah. And and again, I... I've gotta to think that after the depression, this is just kind of like

827
01:01:47,409 --> 01:01:49,846
what Americans felt like they could do.

828
01:01:50,525 --> 01:02:15,279
You know, they they i'm long enough needing to to make do. We'll we'll take a moment for a kind of final thoughts. But before... Before we do that, there's just a few other reflections that I want to to do. I... I'd love to talk a little bit kind of specifically. We we touched on how it holds up Like I said, there's some some problematic depictions in this.

829
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,410
I think for the most part this

830
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:19,730
is

831
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:20,930
generally

832
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:21,930
respectful

833
01:02:22,349 --> 01:02:30,337
at least relative to a lot of of media of this time. You know, obviously, there are some things that wouldn't be shown

834
01:02:30,674 --> 01:02:31,613
or presented

835
01:02:32,351 --> 01:02:32,590
today.

836
01:02:33,268 --> 01:02:33,768
But,

837
01:02:34,505 --> 01:02:36,900
you know, a apart from just sort of the general

838
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:38,819
eastern

839
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:40,539
orient

840
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:41,660
mindset

841
01:02:42,174 --> 01:02:43,353
I I think

842
01:02:43,691 --> 01:02:55,190
he he did a pretty good job again in relative terms. Rating on a curve, you know, I think any media that you look gap from this time is probably going to look

843
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:58,630
pretty dated with some attitudes towards

844
01:02:59,104 --> 01:02:59,604
towards

845
01:03:00,023 --> 01:03:02,100
people from quote the east.

846
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:14,904
But apart from looking at, you know, stuff that might be problematic, I also think it might be interesting to highlight some things that are just out of time. Right? Some some things that are interest saying

847
01:03:15,204 --> 01:03:19,904
dated now. And and I noticed I don't know if you remember at the beginning of the story.

848
01:03:20,724 --> 01:03:26,228
Donald referenced is doing all his shot at the five and ten when he's getting mug by Pete.

849
01:03:26,565 --> 01:03:30,173
I I didn't know what a five and ten was. Did you catch that?

850
01:03:31,563 --> 01:03:33,781
I I've always assumed it was,

851
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,977
you know, some kind of thrift shop or a pawn shop

852
01:03:37,596 --> 01:03:48,384
Yeah. I up and a five and ten is what you might think it is. It's where everything costs either a nickel or a dime. So it's basically an old school dollar store. I noticed

853
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:49,704
I

854
01:03:50,005 --> 01:03:51,505
I made note of

855
01:03:51,964 --> 01:03:56,398
when they misspelled kidnapped, the first time they said kid kidnapped, in the museum.

856
01:03:57,176 --> 01:03:57,676
And

857
01:03:58,213 --> 01:04:03,144
then they spelled it the same way on the next page and the next page. And here at the end when we were

858
01:04:03,562 --> 01:04:04,760
doing our exposition dump,

859
01:04:05,652 --> 01:04:07,349
you know, he was still a kid nap

860
01:04:07,686 --> 01:04:08,665
with one pee.

861
01:04:09,202 --> 01:04:11,377
And and I thought maybe this is just

862
01:04:11,754 --> 01:04:16,416
an old time way of writing that. Right. Yeah. I noticed that this time as well. I also,

863
01:04:16,992 --> 01:04:21,279
you know, had to look up the song because I've I've heard those statues of song lyrics

864
01:04:22,214 --> 01:04:23,524
a few times, but

865
01:04:24,184 --> 01:04:28,104
Hell the games all here what they're seeing at the end, which is very appropriate.

866
01:04:28,944 --> 01:04:30,244
I guess it's from Pirates

867
01:04:31,836 --> 01:04:32,336
and

868
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:35,045
must have been just huge in the popular

869
01:04:35,382 --> 01:04:39,804
imagination at the time. I don't think it's something that we would casually thing anymore.

870
01:04:41,501 --> 01:04:42,681
That's probably true.

871
01:04:43,339 --> 01:04:46,436
I also wanna talk about if there's appearances another media.

872
01:04:47,455 --> 01:04:47,955
So

873
01:04:48,269 --> 01:04:52,089
this... To my knowledge, this was never used as the basis for a

874
01:04:52,509 --> 01:04:54,489
story, which many of them will have been.

875
01:04:54,949 --> 01:04:56,384
But I think famously,

876
01:04:57,844 --> 01:04:59,664
there's a sequence in the opening

877
01:05:00,444 --> 01:05:05,156
That is an homage to this. If you go back and watch the Ducktales theme song.

878
01:05:05,854 --> 01:05:06,673
There is

879
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:07,790
money

880
01:05:08,248 --> 01:05:15,631
waking up looking at a red glowing ring, and I think that's you know, again, part of the mis inspection because I definitely

881
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:16,470
seen

882
01:05:17,008 --> 01:05:21,478
Ducktales by the time I read this even if I read Barks stories earlier.

883
01:05:22,136 --> 01:05:24,690
You know, that gave me reason to expect a real money.

884
01:05:25,408 --> 01:05:26,906
There just never was.

885
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:29,541
There there aren't any

886
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:34,460
i I haven't talked to you about Barks other a career

887
01:05:35,196 --> 01:05:36,892
as as an oil painter,

888
01:05:37,429 --> 01:05:37,929
but

889
01:05:38,505 --> 01:05:41,774
that's something that I will highlight in these episodes

890
01:05:42,113 --> 01:05:44,928
if he ever base a painting off this one.

891
01:05:45,266 --> 01:05:48,540
To my knowledge, there aren't any big oil paintings.

892
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:51,268
Taken from this story.

893
01:05:52,544 --> 01:06:00,209
Do you have any final thoughts about this story? Oh, I... Let me let me interject really quick because I did forget

894
01:06:00,869 --> 01:06:05,209
to talk about... We we talked about how we felt about the story, but for the general

895
01:06:05,509 --> 01:06:05,824
consensus

896
01:06:06,643 --> 01:06:12,578
I like to take a look at there's a website called Inducks. I Al d u c k s

897
01:06:12,957 --> 01:06:16,788
that's kind of Al aggregate where they rate all of the

898
01:06:17,246 --> 01:06:24,353
Disney stories, they let users rate them. So they get a pretty good critical consent from any of these stories.

899
01:06:24,932 --> 01:06:30,226
And this one had a pretty strong seven point six rating,

900
01:06:30,565 --> 01:06:35,359
which puts it as two hundred and fifty four out of more than forty thousand

901
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:37,699
stories, not just Barks stories.

902
01:06:38,779 --> 01:06:47,756
That doesn't put it, like, in the very, very upper echelon on, but that would put this as a pretty well regarded Barks story. So I would say that just,

903
01:06:48,253 --> 01:06:55,871
you know, as is fitting, but this is the first Barks story, and I'll let this kind of be my my final thoughts.

904
01:06:57,606 --> 01:07:00,875
The the this is really the story that

905
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:02,315
set the templates

906
01:07:02,855 --> 01:07:06,675
for what Barks was going to do going forward. You know, these really

907
01:07:07,295 --> 01:07:09,715
grand adventures where through happens

908
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:13,410
they get swept up into something

909
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,450
and they have to

910
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:18,544
figure out their way out a pretty big jam.

911
01:07:19,482 --> 01:07:21,580
And along the way, we

912
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:23,938
oftentimes get treated to

913
01:07:24,517 --> 01:07:25,856
some really interesting

914
01:07:27,049 --> 01:07:29,190
exploration of another culture

915
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:30,349
or,

916
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,349
you know, some some cool aspect of of

917
01:07:34,744 --> 01:07:35,244
g.

918
01:07:35,821 --> 01:07:38,155
So I I think it was just a really

919
01:07:38,492 --> 01:07:41,842
really fun to revisit this one. I'm really glad that I got to.

920
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,668
Do you have any any closing thoughts about this.

921
01:07:47,086 --> 01:07:47,746
I think,

922
01:07:48,844 --> 01:07:50,542
you know, for a for a debut

923
01:07:51,121 --> 01:07:52,040
story, essentially,

924
01:07:53,733 --> 01:07:55,911
Pretty impressive. I would I would have expected,

925
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:56,770
you know,

926
01:07:57,569 --> 01:08:00,985
any any creators first attempt to be a little bit more of a

927
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:07,940
a bundle and really kinda feeling out. You don't really have the right the right tone yet. You don't really have the right pacing yet.

928
01:08:10,035 --> 01:08:10,535
And

929
01:08:12,195 --> 01:08:13,734
I I think it shows a lot of

930
01:08:14,115 --> 01:08:14,615
creativity.

931
01:08:15,234 --> 01:08:15,734
And

932
01:08:16,929 --> 01:08:21,545
kind of an interest in in, you know, really telling something interesting instead of...

933
01:08:22,004 --> 01:08:24,661
I think a lot of the comments of this era might have been more

934
01:08:26,174 --> 01:08:26,374
you know?

935
01:08:27,532 --> 01:08:29,191
I don't know. It could have been something very

936
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:31,589
overly tame and

937
01:08:32,647 --> 01:08:36,435
boring because you know, you can sell it for for a dime, and

938
01:08:36,893 --> 01:08:41,520
and they'll just buy whatever, so Why make it good. But he made it good anyway. Right.

939
01:08:42,453 --> 01:08:46,469
Yeah. There's a lot of loving care that's gone into this, obviously.

940
01:08:46,808 --> 01:08:46,888
Well,

941
01:08:47,886 --> 01:08:53,715
Brian, thank you so much. For for joining me I'm. Really thrilled to get to do this. And

942
01:08:54,493 --> 01:08:57,805
looking forward to having you back for some more of these

943
01:08:59,225 --> 01:09:00,885
So if you

944
01:09:01,545 --> 01:09:02,685
have any

945
01:09:02,985 --> 01:09:04,745
thoughts or comments, listeners,

946
01:09:05,718 --> 01:09:10,906
You can feel free to drop us Al line at Barks remarks at g mail dot com.

947
01:09:11,624 --> 01:09:12,124
And

948
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:18,689
please join us the next time on Mark's remarks when we talk about too many pets.

949
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:20,528
Thank you very much.

950
01:09:21,746 --> 01:09:29,990
And this is Mark jumping in one last time, I had forgotten to mention a couple of things in my notes.

951
01:09:30,685 --> 01:09:33,185
The fact that Barks copied some of the landmarks

952
01:09:33,805 --> 01:09:34,425
that he

953
01:09:34,925 --> 01:09:37,305
saw in the national geographic article

954
01:09:37,685 --> 01:09:39,836
daily life. In Ancient Egypt.

955
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:48,721
Some of the sites depicted in this story include the great swings so Gi on page seventeen, the skyline of Cairo on page seventeen and eighteen.

956
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,059
The pyramid of Made doing...

957
01:09:51,638 --> 01:09:58,550
May on page nineteen, the pyramid of Joe sir on page twenty and the mo rate temple of hat chip shit

958
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:01,789
on page twenty one and twenty two as well as the

959
01:10:02,249 --> 01:10:03,209
of mem.

960
01:10:04,103 --> 01:10:05,879
