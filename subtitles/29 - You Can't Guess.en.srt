00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:55,329
Welcome back to Barks remarks. We've got a special Christmas in February edition of the podcast.

3
00:00:56,048 --> 00:01:01,475
As I've got multiple guests with me to discuss Barks Christmas classic,

4
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:05,795
you can't guess. Why don't so we hear introductions

5
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:13,956
from Warren? Hey. Mark would to be back again? I am a Carl Bark Fan and donald debt collector living in

6
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:22,071
Snowy Rochester, Minnesota and great to be back for this this fun story. Thanks for being back. Hi. I'm Sarah, Santiago.

7
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:31,204
Usually, I come in as some random jack of Al trades, but this one didn't really come up with a topic except, like, receiving gifts.

8
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:36,011
As a something I could be an expert on, but I'm happy to

9
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,339
you know, bring my experiences.

10
00:01:38,836 --> 00:02:02,999
My lived experience is receiving gifts to this podcast. Yeah. Are you are you guys more of the give or receiver of gift? I am definitely fine joy in giving, but I'll tell you. I do love, especially when you have two small grandchildren and nothing beats that reaction. Yeah. There there's nothing like like giving gifts to kids. I I love giving gifts to kids, I find giving gifts to adults a little bit stressful.

11
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:08,113
But when when you nail it, I I feel like that is really satisfying. Yeah. So

12
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:26,999
this this one really is about gift giving. Right? This one is a lot of fun. As as mentioned, we're talking today about you can't guess And, you know, it's it's snowing outside so I can pretend that it's seasonally appropriate, but it is important to me to to release these chronological

13
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:33,214
in order at least with these long form stories, thus are a little Christmas in February,

14
00:02:33,634 --> 00:02:34,134
and

15
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:42,380
I I really enjoyed this one as a kid. I've got some pretty fun memories of this. Warren is this one that you hadn't visited in a while or

16
00:02:42,694 --> 00:03:21,325
Well, I'm so glad you asked me to help out with this one because when you told me about it, I went. I don't know that story. I don't think so then I went back and I looked at it went oh that story. That's the one. I I ate this up as a kid. This was one of my favorite stories for a lot of reasons which we'll get into. But... Yeah, it... I didn't know the name of it. That was my problem. I... It's right there on the flash page, but I I did grow up with this story, and I have a lot of fun memories. Yeah that's true. It took me... I I I hadn't really internalized the title for this one because it's pretty generic. Right? You can't guess. But but it's a fun little bit of wish full fulfillment.

17
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,934
Some of the Barks stories, I think are at their best when when they let you kind of feel like a kid

18
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:30,030
imagining yourself in in the Nephews position.

19
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:33,204
So a little bit of background about this one.

20
00:03:33,724 --> 00:03:40,674
This one was released. This was released in October of nineteen fifth be in the publication Christmas

21
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:52,024
parade. It'll be interesting maybe to consider warren because I know you've read this one how you think this stacks up against the other great Christmas plastics. And Sarah, I did have you read another

22
00:03:52,724 --> 00:04:00,555
another Christmas story. Right? You've got to do the Golden Christmas tree. I did. Yeah. This is not my first Donald Duck Christmas rodeo.

23
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:03,912
So that... Which feels surprising to me. Right? Because

24
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:15,279
I don't feel like that much time has Al elapsed since you've been doing this podcast, but clearly, you've covered many multiples of years enough so that I've come on and this is my second Christmas

25
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:17,999
episode. Yeah. It's true. So

26
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,959
Pirate Gold warren, was that in forty

27
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:21,934
or

28
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:25,167
well pirate gold was forty two

29
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:34,606
forty two. That's right. So we're we're up in nineteen fifteen now, late nineteen fifty. So he's gone through a few of these Christmas cycles and

30
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:46,615
that... That's one of the things about comic books is that they really like to cover Christmas stories because it's an easy hook to sell a story. So so Barb got assigned to do one of these every year.

31
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:49,115
Whether he liked it or not, I would say,

32
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,830
Sometimes he had a great idea for a Christmas story, and

33
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:08,176
sometimes maybe he didn't. But but this one is widely considered to be one of the would you say one this is like one of the three great Christmas stories. I'm gonna put it up there. I... It's my favorite of all of them for a lot of reasons, maybe

34
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:10,145
it doesn't compare to

35
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:11,699
some of the others, but

36
00:05:12,156 --> 00:05:13,135
in its storytelling

37
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:28,598
format, but I I like it because it just features so many of the classic characters at the same time. And and and I love the the fact that the Nephews are are really prominent here. Yeah. It it is fun. To see... I I really like the Donald Inducks family.

38
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:29,656
Story.

39
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:40,934
Sarah, did you did you enjoy or or was that kind of a notable ass back to this one for you how we got to see kind of the extended Ducktales clan. Yeah. It was glad that you'd

40
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:42,854
had me on

41
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:43,789
various

42
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:47,205
episodes to introduce me to Gladstone

43
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:47,824
Gander.

44
00:05:48,323 --> 00:05:51,754
So I knew who he was and what his story was when he

45
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:59,309
when he came in. So I felt like an old pro reading these even though, obviously, this is a lot of my first

46
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:05,256
exposure to the donald dot com and economics in general. Now I feel like I

47
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:13,689
I already knew what was going on. Thread that you've got so much needed background. Yeah. So let's see. This one has been

48
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:14,646
reprinted

49
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,259
Pretty consistently,

50
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:22,779
I I saw seven reprint including the original for the United States, and it's a twenty eight pager

51
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:24,589
a little bit of background

52
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:37,219
trivia about this one warren, feel free to jump in if there's anything that I miss. But This is one of the few remaining stories that does have some human drawn background characters. There's some very

53
00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:38,751
very neat looking

54
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:44,012
humans in this one. I really like that Donald car

55
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:59,081
is so prominent in this one. The good old Be fire run about. That's right. Nineteen thirty four Be. That's right. A nineteen thirty four Bell fire run about as he has he titled one of his with the graphs warranty.

56
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:08,417
Do you have that one? I do. I have two of them. Find. I know why do I have two of them? Well, that was a happy accident, which will say for another podcast.

57
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:11,549
That's great. I I love his car.

58
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:21,554
So so that's a fun aspect to this one for me. A little minor detail will see into the story. This is the first time we see Scrooge bathing and a money bathtub

59
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:33,512
That's right. You know what? I happens to run across for this one. The the rate the Barks was paid for it. Oh tell tell tell us more here. Nut trivia. So I I found this on the...

60
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:54,244
Is this the c Barks dot d k, I think, page And they said that on May twenty fourth, nineteen fifty, Barks was paid for the stories twenty five pages at his standard page rate of six dollars and fifty cents For the story and twenty two dollars for the art, so seven hundred and twelve dollars and fifty cents all in total. Yeah

61
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:58,989
Have you figured out inflation and today's dollars, what that would have been, that would be an interesting

62
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:01,880
exercise wouldn't it? And it what. I'm doing that right now.

63
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:51,585
That would be worth seven hundred twelve dollars and fifty cents. In nineteen fifty is worth eight thousand three hundred eleven dollars and ninety five cents today. Okay. Pretty good rate. But, you know, when you consider it, he only did... Generally two to three of the the the long ones. A year. I lauren. That's right. He would do the four color series and then these Christmas specials and the fires specials and yeah. Right. So... Yeah. I thought that was cool. Any any other trivia that you found notable that this one lauren? Well, you you already mentioned my one of my favorite donald Inducks props and that would be his car. The classic three thirteen, which many listeners and readers might know that March thirteenth is his unofficial birthday, meaning it's the comic book birthday versus the June ninth

64
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:53,182
wei little Hyundai.

65
00:08:54,094 --> 00:09:00,026
Nineteen thirty four. But that's... I've always loved the car as well. Let me ask you, Mark,

66
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:01,479
which issue

67
00:09:02,095 --> 00:09:05,026
did you look at and what color is the card that you're

68
00:09:05,522 --> 00:09:09,784
referencing? Yeah. So I I did this one in there awesome

69
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:22,139
publication of Christmas parade, number one, and it's yellow and that. Yeah. Yellow here in the Fan graphics one as well, which which is a little different than my recollection of his red car. So I

70
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:32,875
just a little bit different there. But I love the the pick of the nineteen early fifties late forties these toys. I'm I'm I'm very very fortunate to have color

71
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:51,541
footage of my father at the age of seven opening up Christmas toys under his Christmas tree And honestly, they're much like what we're seeing in these pictures. Here. Definitely, these toys do feel classic. Right? In a way that the before toys went all digital. This this feels kinda like the default. What of what Christmas toy should look like. Absolutely.

72
00:09:52,037 --> 00:10:03,357
Yeah. They seem very kind of simple and and not branded. Not flashy, you know, not tied to the big toy company or the latest

73
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:16,739
superhero cartoon. Right? Just toy. That's right. That exact definitely part a big part of the charm. So you guys want want to go for some of the international titles here? Yeah. You like to pan to the international audience?

74
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:23,436
Warren and why don't you start us off? Well, I'm gonna I'm gonna start off in with our scan friends, and I'm gonna

75
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:27,559
talk about Norway and Sweden. Let's let's do Norway first. The

76
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:28,678
Nor norwegian

77
00:10:29,257 --> 00:10:36,124
title of this story is Khan D jet. If that's pronounced right, and it's can you guess. Can.

78
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:47,205
Sweden is pretty literal. It's neat khan, if the. You can't guess. So they're right right along lines with the the the perfect translation. Right. Straightforward.

79
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,042
How about yours sarah? We have

80
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:55,394
Germany is guess ones, which is rat and mall.

81
00:10:56,554 --> 00:11:00,854
Mexico though is kind of the outlier and it's Uv

82
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:01,634
go.

83
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:04,787
Rain of gifts, which I think is

84
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,924
quite a bit of a spoiler.

85
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:09,541
Yeah. I like it when

86
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,590
when they don't kinda give... Give away a big element.

87
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:14,744
When I did vacation time,

88
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:16,779
a couple episodes,

89
00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:30,668
Eric, The guest and I were commenting on what a generic title it was. Yeah. But but it's it's kind of a nice little treat because it concealed, how dramatic it's gonna turn? And so I've got France which is kai

90
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:35,097
Pearl Noel. What gift for Christmas is the question that one Barks.

91
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:40,391
And in Netherlands, the dutch is year rat to

92
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:48,844
you'll never guess. So but most of them are are just variations on the the regular one. Background,

93
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:49,979
cultural

94
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:54,813
context, we can talk about that as we go. But to me, the the most interesting

95
00:11:55,312 --> 00:12:03,009
sort of cultural part of this, is the the place that the famed e set used to hold in the childhood

96
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:11,211
imagination. They never actually call these construction sets or e sets, I don't think, but that's that's pretty clearly what they are. Yeah. Very very

97
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:25,265
I never had one as a kid growing up and I'm closest probably to the the demographic of some of these memories. But, yeah, The construction set, they don't use the word. It'll your rec that do they. No. But classic metal parts

98
00:12:25,644 --> 00:13:08,190
I don't think you'll see that much today. Sarah, are you familiar with the classic director set. I know I've heard of them. I never had one. I don't... you know, I was a girl and I had very gender toys and so nobody I knew had one but, you know, I don't know. My sample size may be skewed. Sure. Yeah. I I I didn't have one either, but I know they're very famous for, like, how versatile the they are and and they're... They weren't thought of as, I think it's a really special toy. Right. That you could do anything with. A lot of the kids who got them turned into engineers I suspect. So I I think when we see them in the story we're supposed to think oh, this is like, the big ticket. Toy while also not being like a a licensed

99
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:12,915
teddy Ru pin or or whatever. I also suggest that it's

100
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,630
precursor to the Legos

101
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:18,635
of friday today. They're extremely versatile in their

102
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:19,792
building

103
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,946
ability and other creativity

104
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:35,398
Right. Yeah. Good point. Alright. So you guys ready to dive into the story itself Let's go toy a shopping. Excellent. Let's do. I'm I'm gonna start us off. This is one where I I left out a little bit of trivia

105
00:13:35,737 --> 00:13:40,112
because this is a really cool opener. Right? This is a big, beautiful

106
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:41,510
full page

107
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:45,118
splash panel with the kids peer into

108
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:47,712
a Toy shop that has some of those

109
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:55,547
classic looking toys that we were just talking about but it's it's a really nice looking page. It's ornament with little bits of holidays

110
00:13:56,124 --> 00:14:03,020
and this is the last time the last of three, where he gets to do one of these full page

111
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:08,166
slash panel. It's our other Christmas one letter to Santa has the great opening

112
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:20,765
with steam shovel vacation time rather. Vacation time, love it with the the animals and the bridge and the... And again, the classic car. So we've got the Nephews looking in the toy Toy shop, and they are

113
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:24,885
indecisive. They're trying to figure out what they want for Christmas.

114
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:30,375
And as we transition to them going in the Toy store, we have this, like, kinda heartwarming

115
00:14:30,714 --> 00:14:33,252
conversation between them where they're acknowledging

116
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:51,173
all of the nice toys that they already have and how Santa Claus has been so good to them every year that they can't think of anything that they really need, and they make this really nice, big hearted as they call it decision that they're gonna skip Christmas.

117
00:14:51,644 --> 00:15:05,475
And so they write Santa a letter and tell him to give their presence to other kids. And I I like this you guys. I thought this was really cute. Really sweet. It's kind of predictable that as soon as they put their

118
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:14,465
envelope in the Barks, they're gonna... They're gonna see some thing that It was suspicious right away. I was, like, I wrote down.

119
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:15,662
What's the angle?

120
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,239
U.

121
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:25,963
Are they gonna be greedy, are they gonna be... Is Donald gonna cause a problem? Like, I hadn't I haven't read enough of these to see what direction

122
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:35,165
this is gonna lead them. And, you know, often I'm finding, like, even in, like, the simpsons. Right? Like, the first, like, five minutes of the show

123
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:37,972
sets up them to go in a completely different

124
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:58,245
direction and has nothing to do with that five... First five minutes Oh, oh, I also was wondering if they were gonna go chase down, the mail truck, are they gonna get in themselves and trouble that way. And then I was like, no, they're a little bit too smart. That's sounds like something Donald would do and the kids would have to rescue him from. So I was on edge honestly.

125
00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:11,174
I was right. Sarah, I was probably a little bit more morally optimistic that these boys were gonna do a good turn and be Al little good junior would check But then again, we would have a pretty boring story wouldn't we.

126
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:13,209
So

127
00:16:13,827 --> 00:16:20,608
but what a noble gesture? I just love those panels of of sheer joy in doing something nice for someone else

128
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:33,690
talks about how not simple that their lives are, but not in a derogatory way. Right? Like Right. They know that they're cared for... They have all of their needs met. They have it

129
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:45,870
they haven't realized how much of a parent they've become. So they don't worry about wider issues like, bills or whatever. Right? They're just like we have everything we need and it's these toys,

130
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:47,204
and we're solid.

131
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:55,105
Yeah. I I think that's a really good point. I think this really paints a picture of some kids who feel comfortable purple and secure. Barks is obviously

132
00:16:55,485 --> 00:17:06,583
positioning them to be good at the beginning of this story. Right? Sometimes he positions them to set them up to be missed mischievous. So he he doesn't use different characters for that. He'll just

133
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,572
decide the kind of the version of characters.

134
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:15,169
That he want. And so as they leave as they mailed their letter, they see

135
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:42,540
a toy that they don't already have that they realize Oh, actually, this is something we've always want. It's a building set. And again, it is a e set. I think that's a branded word. At this time. But but we are meant to see this as the big hot toy for many decades in fact, and we see these really cool instructions, you know, in the display shop. There's a ferris wheel and a crane.

136
00:17:43,040 --> 00:18:06,522
These are things you can really do if So they they realized that they've got a rush back, stop the mailman man, but it's too late. And this is all basically been a nice set up to the fact that Now, they can't depend on Santa claus. They've gotta ask their uncle Donald to see if he'll buy one for them. And so we're kinda side stepping Santa. For this Christmas story. Right. And they they race home,

137
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:10,005
optimistic that Uncle donald will bail them out.

138
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:19,815
So they see Don shoveling snow. They humbly walk up to him and and then I love the the faces on these and nephews. Now they they... They're just all please

139
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:21,455
not begging

140
00:18:21,955 --> 00:18:25,095
quite so much, but asking donald for the

141
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:36,621
opportunity to buy something for them. And donald this is kinda clueless as to what's going on. You want me to guess Oh, no Tell you, and they they explained that they do want this new buildings that they saw. And the donald

142
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,315
is is I kinda like his parental

143
00:18:39,655 --> 00:19:01,715
choices here. He's saying, well, you know, I don't believe in giving things so easily. Let's we'll have to do something to earn it, then I thought that was pretty cool. So they start wanting to do whatever it takes. Chores around the house. Nope. You don't get my point he says when they asked to shovel snow or do whatever. You should not have to work you should have to worry. That wasn't interesting, like, why?

144
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:03,595
It's Sarah

145
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,735
Yeah. We're all kinda making, like,

146
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:08,685
faces. Half marie.

147
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:13,635
Was so mad. That was a poor choice of words mister Barks. I don't know.

148
00:19:14,013 --> 00:19:31,022
What you think was going on there, I mean, that's such a... I was as you were talking and you're were, like, you know, they're gonna tell them what what they really want. I was thinking about the spice girls. So tell me what you want what you really would want? And donald like, no, you have to guess. I want you to worry.

149
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:35,650
I'm glad warren that you read that. Lying out. Right? Because that that really

150
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:46,749
struck me every time I read it you... You should... I don't mean you should have to work. You should have to worry. All I can come up with is that Barks really wanted to set this

151
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:48,480
specific product.

152
00:19:49,014 --> 00:20:00,549
I don't think he found an elegant way to do it So he made donald Al little bit a little bit of a jerk here Right? Because he's he's toy with them. It's it's weird,

153
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:45,545
but it does... It does set up what he wants. And I do like I really like this lot elements, right, where they have to guess what he wants, I think it's really fun. I think it's really intrigued. I don't think it's set up in the most elegant way. Although, you know, it's not that weird are donald, I guess. But when you look at the very next panel after that odd statement, which which we all reacted to. I love what Donald says in the first line. Well, let me put it this way. That's what he says. Let me put it this way. So he clears the air a little bit and says you'll have to guess what I want and I'll buy what you want. And I thought that was... Okay. Now we've set up the story. Right. It's very... I'm sorry To interrupt it. It's it's it's a good little bit of economical storytelling.

154
00:20:46,045 --> 00:21:00,178
I just wanna ask you guys, do you think it's generous to to think that maybe Donald wants them to kind of practice some like empathy put themselves in his purse perspective and and be like, oh, there are things that don.

155
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:11,346
You're shaking your head sarah. No. This is this is totally in character for Donald. Right? Donald has poor boundaries. He makes his problems everybody's problems. One of the

156
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:16,251
Barks of poor boundaries is not using your words expect

157
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:28,433
people to be mind readers and then being upset when they can't read your mind. Right? So obviously, he's not be becoming upset when they can't read his mind, but he's still putting the burden

158
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:51,870
of communication and and reading his minds on the kit Right, sarah. And I'm gonna go up one level deeper and say, we have just seen some selfish on b on behalf of the Nephews and now we're seeing donald Salt as well. And I'm... There's an underlying little underlying theme of selfish going on here. Would you agree? I would say that it's more age appropriate for the kids.

159
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:57,752
I think that Mark is right that, you know, like, we should be teaching kids, like,

160
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:12,841
have some empathy think about, you know, somebody else's experience besides yourself, but we already know they can do that because that's why they come to him in the first place because they've already told San to give their presence to somebody else like, why

161
00:22:13,537 --> 00:22:13,976
why?

162
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:16,248
Is not question.

163
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:52,937
Yeah. Good. Yeah. He's he's being very selfish and he is acting like a child. And they're also, you know, they want something, and that's okay. And they're acting age appropriately. And I will say that we now know that the Nephews have always had one up donald in many ways and so they're they're sort of intellectual piers if not a little bit superior that way. So the next panel is so you want us to guess it are very excited because I think they know they can guess and donald says, yep. You just have to guess because I only want one thing he says. So they immediately start start rattling off a list of things some practical,

164
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:54,735
some not so practical.

165
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:57,984
New radio a television. I get that but

166
00:22:58,802 --> 00:22:59,520
Al applying sauce.

167
00:23:00,438 --> 00:23:04,625
Now while he's doing all this, Donald is just walking around doing his household Barks. He's

168
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:10,185
s the fire. He's sitting back in his easy chair. He's addressing Christmas Barks.

169
00:23:10,525 --> 00:23:20,621
And they keep coming at him with all of these things and you probably spotted this mark, but then an Adam bomb, and then I I could immediately thought of the other

170
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:23,332
the other series that we saw that Adam.

171
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:33,410
U. U. Yeah. But he keeps going, and and I they realized it isn't very easy. Harder of them they thought. And I think they believe them. They really can't guess what he's wanting. So

172
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:41,422
they ask him again is this the deal I have we have to guess and Deals he looks the letter. So they go off and they start thinking

173
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:49,785
about them some time passes. And I love these next few frames because it's just so exaggerated and so Santa's Christmas list.

174
00:23:50,122 --> 00:23:59,655
If you kinda think about the historic and traditional Christmas list that the boys have already created their very long list of things, and he reads off several

175
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:03,235
odd crazy items. You wanna read them off foreign?

176
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:12,171
Sure, I'll read them often in panel two on that page. It's a cy run, a camera tool set fishing pull, tenth hive of bees

177
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,816
cow bell spinning wheel, butterfly,

178
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:19,317
net, gun, Canary, and then about twenty, etcetera

179
00:24:19,948 --> 00:24:25,716
what I would call the the homer Simpson dope moment, you know, would be the boys just kinda like false

180
00:24:26,254 --> 00:24:35,947
because he doesn't get it. They don't get it. And don't you got everything here, but you haven't guess the one thing I want. And then they're Groggy, they're exhausted. They say wait, I think we can find out

181
00:24:36,539 --> 00:25:00,415
when Uncle donald falls Al asleep tonight, he'll give us a clue. And boy, fortunately for them, he laid down and starts sn really quick warren and I Yeah. I just wanted to say, I love that little sequence where i you do is. I agree with you that sequence where he's reading through the list. It it strikes me very much like, careful what you wish for. You know, you you kinda brought this on yourself, Donald as they come in with this

182
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:40,659
list that must be able to wrap all the way around the house. It looks very funny to me. Oh, it is. And then of course on sleeping. He's he's not talking plain American. I thought that was pretty cool. And then, of course, my classic favorite fighting donald comes in to his thought balloon and you see this boxing fighting donald with the eyes clothes on the couch, and we'll come back to favorite panels, but this is probably to one of my favorite panels is the next one with the silhouette of the three Nephews, and I just have to read what they're saying. It's no use. All he dreams about is fighting. And I thought that was just setting up donald for who he is. But then the ask well, how about boxing gloves? We got those. How about not nope got those

183
00:25:41,116 --> 00:26:05,691
so we thought of those, but he didn't want them. So they finally realized the only way they're gonna guess with don wants for Christmas that one item is to seek out his girlfriend daisy Inducks. So they race over to Da, house ring the doorbell and you take it from here. Before we go on, what do you guys think? Warren you you like that sleep fighting bit. I I agree. I thought that was hilarious. What did you think of that sleep fighting bit, Sarah? It was very

184
00:26:06,444 --> 00:26:06,944
much

185
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:10,373
characterization that I understood of donald,

186
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,848
you know, constantly

187
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:26,205
under threat from his own Inducks insecurities even in his leaked So... Yeah. Alright. And and we don't usually see the, like, cartoon behavior, bleed into the comics. I feel like this donald is much more, you know, He's plain spoken,

188
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:30,485
but that this is something I could imagine being out of the classic cartoons.

189
00:26:30,985 --> 00:26:32,820
Right? It also is a good

190
00:26:33,477 --> 00:26:34,654
bit of foreshadowing

191
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:37,364
as to his encounter with glad.

192
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:39,755
Right? Yeah. It's setting him up as

193
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:58,102
a flight picker. Right. And Sarah, you're gonna tell us about this part where he where where they go to daisy, but I I just wanna mention I really like how Barks gets... He sets up this neat little structure for the rest of the store. Right? We're gonna see this cool pattern

194
00:26:58,441 --> 00:26:59,900
where they're gonna approach

195
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:01,275
relatives

196
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:04,115
or close family friends. And

197
00:27:04,695 --> 00:27:43,403
and and I like that. It's it just feels like very clean meat storytelling. So Go for it. Yeah. So he takes us... So the boys decide to go see daisy and two of them stay home to hold down the floor, and one of them goes hat in hand to to Daisy and it's just you you know, do you know what Donald would want for Christmas and she does so she decides if she's going to take them Al to a mind reader who will be able to figure it out. But when Donald duck sits down with the mind reader the readers becomes very offended because she's

198
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:51,010
decided that what he wants based on his deepest Barks thoughts is a picture of herself so that he can

199
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,042
scare the boys with it. Which is, you know,

200
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,660
she's not she's drawn with some extra wrinkles very much like the old witch in in snow

201
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,520
white and a big hooked nose and she's not conventionally attractive.

202
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,035
And I think he was right to be offended. And

203
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:16,395
and kick them out for that insult. Yeah. This this part feels very

204
00:28:16,934 --> 00:28:23,035
discord to me. Right? It's very jarring because, like, the mind reader is drawn

205
00:28:23,413 --> 00:28:28,633
deliberately to, like, provoked the reader to think about how how ugly

206
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,595
she supposedly looks. And and it's it's a big joke on her appearance.

207
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:43,291
Yeah. And she's... you know, she's drunk. She's not... She's wearing, you know, kind of the equivalent of a mum and a house code, she's rather large.

208
00:28:43,884 --> 00:28:44,664
She's wearing

209
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:46,104
slip on slippers.

210
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:53,879
She's she's like meant think of her as as French. Right? Some sort of generic European, I guess. Memo

211
00:28:54,618 --> 00:28:55,118
d

212
00:28:55,497 --> 00:29:10,555
is her name dick. And it's in the parking mountains on the couch. Mine's pumped out twenty five cents. I thought that was pretty cute psychic gig. I have so many thoughts about this page. Like first off. You guys I thought it was so sweet. I I read this to my my daughter,

213
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:24,186
a couple of weeks ago as part of my prep for this. And I kind of... I stopped her eye warned. Okay. I really like this story. But there's a part where, like, the joke is is at the expense of this characters

214
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:40,645
looks. And it's not very nice, and so she was prime to see it. And so when we when we got to that page, she was she enjoyed it very thought fully with me. And when we got passed, I was asked her, what do you think? And and she was so sweet. Like, that's me. She's beautiful.

215
00:29:41,465 --> 00:29:51,521
It comes So I was so proud because she's like she's fairly drawn to provoke this reaction, but she's also, like, when we see her talking and private with daisy,

216
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,615
You know, they're just speaking very.

217
00:29:54,715 --> 00:30:00,075
She does seem very nice and very sweet until she reads Donald spots,

218
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,050
and is very...

219
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,990
Calls him an insulting mom

220
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:15,547
to to wanted her peak to frighten he's nephews with Barks you talked about the the characterization of this character, this mind reader. And it may be wonder

221
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:26,891
if and it happens again with Uncle Scrooge, but it made you wonder why they had to leave their place of residence and seek out someone to to convince them. I thought they might have some other way of doing it, but it's an interesting

222
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:38,993
story telling concept by reducing these bit characters to Well, and you gotta get him to drive valet away in the cart. Oh you're right. Thank you. Yes. You have to get that repeated

223
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:43,725
roping in there. Yeah. Thank you. Right. Go ahead. And so to that point,

224
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:44,925
after

225
00:30:46,225 --> 00:30:48,145
to it kicks them all out,

226
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:51,112
daisy demands to be taken right home.

227
00:30:51,949 --> 00:31:13,120
But the car breaks down. Mh. And Donald says you or Daisy. The kids and I will have to get out and push. She just gets so mad. She's just like, nope. You do it yourself. Barks off, And like, thinks about it, you know, as she kind of processes for anger. She's like, you know what he really needs is a car. I'm just gonna get to on hold a car for Christmas.

228
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:22,185
And I'm sure we all had the thought of, like, that's a really big gift. I mean, she she's doing it so that she isn't

229
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:36,010
you know, she doesn't have to write around in that up too. I can kind of understand. I've given gifts where I'm like, I'm a little bit inconvenience by this aspect of your life. Here is a thing that that will make me happier.

230
00:31:36,387 --> 00:32:18,099
Let's totally get it. Yeah. And it's not out of bounds for, like, a girl end but it it is interesting. I I couldn't help but think of like that kid that little kid lack of understanding of what a car cost versus what director set costs, you know? Mh. I mean... Yeah. I had to put aside so much of my disbelief for was like, okay, Okay. This is for kids. This is not for adults who how much things actually cost. I would this is just as possible as a wife buying Lexus for the husband without even talking about it. Dressing with a big bow on top of it. And then we we shouldn't gloss over the fact that we've got, like daisy duck walking into the bank to

231
00:32:18,598 --> 00:32:19,857
make a a major

232
00:32:20,196 --> 00:32:20,696
purchase

233
00:32:21,034 --> 00:33:03,164
as a single woman in nineteen fifty. Right? Yeah. I was make of the same thing Mark here she is. The last panel is her making that entrance since it's a bank, although she's disgusted, she is absolutely deep Herman. And I I don't know the specifics of it. But but I know that it wasn't really common for... I I think bank loans were still, like being denied to women at this time in American history in general, but Barks is kinda showing this like it's just a normal thing. So I I has as much of a right to, you know, a bank account and credit as as anyone does. I I didn't notice that. Thank you for pointing that out. That is really progressive. Right. Yeah. He he has his flash. Here in there.

234
00:33:03,544 --> 00:33:06,455
Alright. So we're we're gonna we're gonna basically

235
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:12,460
proceed now to the next member of the Ducktales family. Right? He's the the kids have gone to Daisy,

236
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:17,544
and things went pair shaped. Now they're gonna approach their uncle Scrooge

237
00:33:18,143 --> 00:33:27,710
and see if he can help out. And we don't quite have Scrooge and the money did. But we do see him shoveling his money into like, these large.

238
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,942
It is called the money bin. Right? Because there's some signage there that points it out.

239
00:33:33,281 --> 00:33:45,219
Double decker money. Yes. The double decker Money pepsi. So we're kinda... We're kinda getting getting there. This this Scrooge is pretty close to the kind of the final version of his character.

240
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:48,811
And and they asked him for the help guessing.

241
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:57,015
What he might want, and he's outraged because he just sees this as he he hears the word gift and he's like, someone's gonna angle

242
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:01,061
for me to give someone a gift, and that costs money. And,

243
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:18,429
you know, as as he kinda shoes the nephews out, he starts to kind of process and he thinks to himself, you know, if if Donald doesn't get the kids the building set that they want who's gonna have to do it? It's gonna be poor old uncle Scrooge.

244
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:24,545
I I love the ridiculous thought process he has here where he essentially tops himself into...

245
00:34:24,884 --> 00:34:25,744
Into everything,

246
00:34:26,204 --> 00:34:46,265
He determines that he needs to get an next skirt. And so he like daisy. I had a question about the... How to interpret Scrooge just motivation. He knows that the kids aren't likely to get their toy unless he helps out. Is he motivated by wanting to help them? Or is he motivated

247
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,759
out of just kind of recent resent

248
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,279
obligation for

249
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:57,960
this, you know, family attachment that he has. I think we're supposed to read this as, like, the resent

250
00:34:58,376 --> 00:35:01,267
obligation but that there may be, like, the colonel

251
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:06,654
of Karen, somewhere buried in there. That's my take on. That's a good question. So Scrooge

252
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:11,110
likewise kind of shuttle donald to another mental

253
00:35:11,464 --> 00:35:19,936
and this is something that's always interested me about Carl Barks. Right? Is so many of his stories are like about hard work, and and rationality,

254
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:24,599
but then he has a lot of stories with this kind of like hit

255
00:35:24,975 --> 00:35:48,747
and mind reading and and past lives stuff, it it it almost reads is a little bit hippie ish. I think he had kind of his, like, his hippie side. Warren you can probably think of ton. Right? Oh yeah. You see that in so many. He's out there. If a lot of the Yeah. And and it is a a good storytelling hook, obviously. You have to get... If you wanna tell the kind of stories he does.

256
00:35:49,266 --> 00:35:49,766
But

257
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:54,010
he takes him to a hit test named professor Or

258
00:35:54,348 --> 00:35:55,565
or, and

259
00:35:56,061 --> 00:36:07,266
he consults in the same way days he did with the hip saying what he wants, and we get to see this he do the classic me mesmerizing thing and it results in Donald

260
00:36:08,018 --> 00:36:11,313
only being able to clock like a chick.

261
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,544
Which is quite ironic when you think about a deduct being a chicken, but

262
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:16,560
Right?

263
00:36:17,815 --> 00:36:39,012
And so the the professor like, oh, you can't talk, but I think he can show us. What he wants for Christmas. He directs him to go pointed it out, and they they follow in in the car as Donald leaves them to a feed door and he points to a sack of corn and Scrooge is outrage and the the hi twists

264
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:45,388
admit. Well, you know, I I did the best I could, but All I can do is advertise people so they think they're chickens.

265
00:36:46,026 --> 00:36:54,673
I love that. I I love that stupid gag. I I think it's great Did you like that bit sarah? I did. I thought it was funny. It was interesting

266
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,747
to see how his

267
00:36:57,523 --> 00:37:04,066
was kind of in the media. Right? You know, we grew up on this ideas and partly

268
00:37:04,525 --> 00:37:07,902
informed by these comics that hit

269
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:26,640
was a way to control people, you know, all of these things that you're saying were just felt so normal within cartoon Sphere. Right. So as I was reading this, I was like, oh, of course, he would. Because I've been to, you know, hi for for therapy type reasons. There's a lot of really good evidence

270
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:28,335
supporting hit

271
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:30,255
in certain situations

272
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:31,975
that are therapeutic.

273
00:37:32,355 --> 00:37:32,855
Obviously,

274
00:37:33,275 --> 00:37:37,430
not the type where you make somebody think they're chicken. And so I was wondering

275
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,750
where he was going with this

276
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:44,890
and went where I should've have expected it, which was... It it was it was very interesting.

277
00:37:45,744 --> 00:38:12,618
Right. It's it's the throw a silly humor. And it has a really good cap where the guy it's like, wait. Wait. I. I know someone who's a goat test you can making thinking go as if that'll help One of my favorite moments, Mark, if you don't mind on that, reach those. When he does right before revealing that he... That's all he does is make people think their chickens. I love how the boys are just pounding the floor. The little mouse sticks up and looks at them. And the boy say something that's a little un

278
00:38:13,276 --> 00:38:31,954
because throughout most of the stories, they refer to their uncle Douglass on donald, But here they say we want to know what donald Duck wants for Christmas, and then you led to the next panel where he like, hey, this is all I do. But I love the little gag in the background because you see two, maybe could've have been characters.

279
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:36,744
Ro Ru and Henry Al a hand. So you've got this funny animal

280
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:46,969
naming convention continuing on with characters that have never you'll never hear from again, but they're out there Inducks, so I don't know. Just a little bit of his side. Right.

281
00:38:47,346 --> 00:38:59,045
Yeah. There mouse. Yeah. That little mouse is cute little size guy. There's a lot of good size gag that we've kinda gloss over here, but they're they're definitely worth looking for. So just like how a goat hit

282
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:00,525
is not a hip

283
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:17,849
fore goat, or hi twists, who is go? It's a hit who makes you believe that you're go. Right. There's clearly a big Barks dot for a needing to be digitized to think your different animals. Not the first time either. Donald was hepatitis to think he was a kangaroo

284
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,230
in one of Barks most famous stories.

285
00:39:20,789 --> 00:39:21,750
So again,

286
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,170
they had home

287
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,170
disgusted

288
00:39:24,605 --> 00:39:28,184
And again, we get a pretty spectacular car failure

289
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:30,904
screwed refuses to help

290
00:39:31,365 --> 00:39:36,339
and the nephews have to push the car home while Scrooge is left to ponder,

291
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:38,599
what Donald needs?

292
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:51,269
And he decides that he is gonna buy him a new car because he can never tell when he may need him to drive screws someplace. And that's all the hand waving we get to explain why

293
00:39:51,688 --> 00:40:03,606
why Scrooge would spend so much money. But as far as these things go, I I found it pretty believable. And and at the conclusion of this page, you know, they pass their cousin Gladstone

294
00:40:03,765 --> 00:40:04,265
gander

295
00:40:05,082 --> 00:40:05,582
docking

296
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,577
at Donald predicament.

297
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:27,265
Being pushed by his nephew. What a great way to introduce the third member of the the family here and to see what happens here. I was really love this part I love what he says here. He says greetings slowly worm. And so I went wait a minute. Lol worm that's richard scary that... That was a children's book character.

298
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:43,465
So I did little research, and it turns out that Richard scary started his career in nineteen fifty as an art student. And he created Lol Worm. The character for his funny animal books in nineteen sixty three. So I have to say he was a Barks reader. Wow wow good Al.

299
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:52,791
Yeah just gonna I just read a book to my my two year old with lily where I'm minute it and just a few nights ago, and I never... I didn't even pick up on that.

300
00:40:53,711 --> 00:41:06,046
That's where he got it. I'm gonna... I'm gonna say he did. I'm just that I'm that optimistic about the Okay. The community of artist and Huey, back in the fifties and sixties that he was inspired by mister Barks. But anyway, Gladstone yells out

301
00:41:06,622 --> 00:41:07,122
to

302
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:11,589
donald in the Nephews. They're... The nephews are pushing down louis card

303
00:41:12,165 --> 00:41:33,228
tyson Gladstone gander. And then there's then the battle and Sue here, the battle of words, the battle of greetings Donald just can't take it anymore after he installs donald and and his ability to not drive his car and you need a new car and you're a big wind bag and and they they go face to face eyeball bought eyeball and, you know... Honestly point

304
00:41:33,605 --> 00:41:41,915
right Severino the car. Yeah. He's never owned a car. Yeah. Yeah. And then he goes well, I can if I want, I'm lucky. Huey, he. Well then start wanting one.

305
00:41:42,473 --> 00:41:43,771
I gotta be show.

306
00:41:44,827 --> 00:42:05,421
I love it. And again, the classic fighting donald here, circling around you're lucky to find nickel nichols but not but automobiles are clear out of your class so you you're you're a lucky guy, but you're a you're like a like a down and Lucky guy, you know? But now if you can you can really show me if you get a car. And he says You know what Yeah. Sorry. I didn't mean interrupt.

307
00:42:06,078 --> 00:42:08,510
But you know what I love about this fighting sequence.

308
00:42:08,885 --> 00:42:12,425
Neither ever heard throw a punch. They're are justice

309
00:42:12,765 --> 00:42:16,359
just circling each other with their fist cock. Just.

310
00:42:17,178 --> 00:42:40,523
And since so that won't convince you that that I'm gonna buy a car for Christmas by Golly, I'm gonna get a car, and I'm gonna get one for you too. And donald still doesn't accept it. The Vaccine seen is they're moving to the super service station is the nephew saying know, he couldn't buy a cl out of a fend. It's go look up. Group it again. Yeah. Gray line. And, of course, the last panel on that page is glad stone absolutely

311
00:42:40,939 --> 00:42:46,498
regretting his statement. So he this next series of panel shows him just at his absolutely.

312
00:42:47,130 --> 00:43:02,467
Down t worse. Ducktales dragging on the floor droop face as he wander and wonders how he can Severino he needs to be lucky like right now. And sure enough, he walks past... Who I I kind of kind of a margaret Du kind of a character

313
00:43:02,925 --> 00:43:15,777
from the March Brothers movies is very wealthy and very social... High social standard. And I love what she says, I can't stand seeing anyone unhappy at Christmas I can't stand and you this grown off panel.

314
00:43:16,235 --> 00:43:27,401
And she turns out to give a few thousand dollars to chew them up a little bit, the next panel, great panel, and he's just handing the cash over to the car salesman who wants to purchase not one, but two char,

315
00:43:27,795 --> 00:43:29,933
work car with red side wall tires.

316
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:31,331
Imported

317
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,690
sports bottles

318
00:43:33,468 --> 00:43:50,312
imported not even domestic. You guys adult me lu this page so much. Like child me definitely, my favorite page is is probably an obvious pick, but this is hilarious. I love him rounding the corner with that like, long face and the comic

319
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:54,000
over the top drawn wealthy social.

320
00:43:54,938 --> 00:44:00,690
Just like here a few thousand dollars to help you buy some joy for fellow.

321
00:44:01,982 --> 00:44:05,871
It's a pretty good art too. Obviously, for opera glasses

322
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:19,085
are have little lines radiating from them to kind of draw attention to them for jewel, have lines radiating from them to their attention to them and to, you know, show that they are sparkly

323
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:19,924
and

324
00:44:20,502 --> 00:44:21,002
luxurious.

325
00:44:21,461 --> 00:44:28,008
You know exactly where to look, and that's one of the things I've always appreciated Barks is art... Yeah. She

326
00:44:28,745 --> 00:44:36,805
os tai well and just that idea that she's like, well, it's Christmas Have a few thousand dollars to stop being? Sad.

327
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:44,526
But again, my fate one of my favorite depictions of Glad is it is most down down his luck. Kind of.

328
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:53,505
Turns here. Great panel. Yeah. So that wraps up Gladstone little episode, and the kids have moved on to

329
00:44:53,844 --> 00:44:55,342
check in with grandma

330
00:44:55,721 --> 00:44:59,896
duck. Because there's a grandma duck, which I haven't met yet is she

331
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:09,090
has she appeared so far? Yeah. Grandma Inducks she... She's definitely appeared. A good few times. She doesn't usually make it into the longer.

332
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:13,153
Stories except for, like, some of these Christmas ones. But she

333
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,066
she appears in

334
00:45:15,443 --> 00:45:39,063
some stories. I think some stories it's i think she might occasionally appear without some of the other dots and I remember right one? Yeah. Grandma mad Ducktales was a story angle there to kinda introduce other ducks in the clan, if you will, and there was a the a series of cop called the Inducks Family albums she appeared in and in a lot of the ten pages. But, yeah, she did appear her own series with Cousin

335
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:49,169
Gus goose, I think is it or... Yeah help me. Yep. That's boost her her hired hand because she's usually... I we don't really see her farm here Dewey we, but she's

336
00:45:50,799 --> 00:45:53,928
home farm friends. And so what's her relationship

337
00:45:54,265 --> 00:46:02,994
with Uncle Scrooge then is she the mother? Boy. That... That's a whole thing. There there was... There have been pages and pages

338
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:04,151
about the gen

339
00:46:04,648 --> 00:46:05,507
and and

340
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:06,999
Don Rosa

341
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:08,198
eventually

342
00:46:08,657 --> 00:46:16,444
will basically sketch it out. But I I think that Barks did have kind of a working idea. Of the gene theology.

343
00:46:16,823 --> 00:46:21,039
She she is actually the Nephew great grandmother. And Donald Grandma

344
00:46:21,618 --> 00:46:24,855
and not related directly to Scrooge.

345
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:28,027
Okay. So she's not scottish. Correct.

346
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:28,826
Okay.

347
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:34,401
Don Rosa will kind of, like he'll... Hill rat on these different relationships

348
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:35,335
into...

349
00:46:35,995 --> 00:46:47,922
He'll actually put out a a neat little Inducks family tree that's that's rather acute. And and it's it's basically kind of become more or less canon. That fun repo to she's Al.

350
00:46:48,561 --> 00:46:50,194
El dot. Is...

351
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:54,503
Personal name. Nice. So the kids the boys show up

352
00:46:55,319 --> 00:47:01,739
and they're asking if she has any idea. And she says, no. I don't know what

353
00:47:02,476 --> 00:47:19,553
he might want, but if you find out, so I'll buy it for him, which is kind of new. Nobody's ever said that out loud to to them, you know, the We donald although they asked for them to guess what he wanted. He didn't actually ask for the thing. So it's very kind of her.

354
00:47:20,052 --> 00:47:22,765
And so they take off and they're look really excited

355
00:47:23,623 --> 00:47:27,719
that they have at least her support for that, but they just are so

356
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:28,598
frustrated.

357
00:47:29,337 --> 00:47:31,450
Might as well go home and give up

358
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:33,485
and donald

359
00:47:33,822 --> 00:47:37,952
pulls around the corner as they're walking home and offers to

360
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:44,915
drive them the rest of the way and wouldn't you know it the car breaks down in a big

361
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:51,089
choke louise and then a whole panel that says lamb.

362
00:47:52,349 --> 00:47:52,589
Again.

363
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,464
So it and the the the There's

364
00:47:56,884 --> 00:48:05,199
fluid leaking everywhere. Looks like steam from one end and exhaust from the other. The tires are all of you

365
00:48:05,537 --> 00:48:07,194
and Donald just...

366
00:48:07,692 --> 00:48:18,408
Donald just opens his heart and starts speaking from there. And he says I can't pick this old heap any longer. I have to get a new one as he's steering while the boys are pushing.

367
00:48:19,047 --> 00:48:20,685
And then they catch on. Oh,

368
00:48:21,618 --> 00:48:34,097
that means that he's he's telling us what he wants, he wants a new car. And he really needs one. The kids are like, yeah. He really needs one. So they call grandma Inducks and

369
00:48:34,434 --> 00:48:41,053
tell her the good news and it says land states a lot is which is just the cutest old lady

370
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:48,569
introduction? I if I ask really quick. What what do you guys think of like the the nephews like oblivious

371
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:53,335
here, how how over the top it is that they they clearly should realized this.

372
00:48:54,108 --> 00:49:04,244
Couple of breakdowns i ago. I'm gonna suggest they should have realized it when they brought out the list that was about fifty feet long yeah this can't be the first time and in their world

373
00:49:04,545 --> 00:49:20,255
that that car broke down three times of the story with the same bla and the tires and the smoke. Yeah. I I find the possibility here a little bit awkward. But think. Ask the reader, I never know. Right? Because I'm trying to impose you know, real world rules

374
00:49:20,595 --> 00:49:24,055
and logic onto this cartoon, so I never know

375
00:49:24,674 --> 00:49:26,430
what plot and what's

376
00:49:26,968 --> 00:50:07,609
suspension of disbelief. Right? So I had just been using my suspension of disbelief this whole time. Right? That that's very common thing that, like, he has car problems never occurred to me that that was what he actually wanted until I started noticing that people were buying him car But if you had, like, sat me down at the beginning with the boys, I would have a guess of how about a car because to us, that's a big... Everybody needs a new car. I just bought, you know, my husband and I just bought a car ourselves. And so, like, it's a thing. And that adult The adults need having the new newest cars. It's a nice thing, but I put that aside because that's a

377
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:10,109
adult Right. Literal thinking sarah.

378
00:50:10,724 --> 00:50:11,224
What?

379
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:27,040
I don't know what donald duck. But see you just said it though, and I think this is the classic point in the story. It's... What do you want Donald Inducks? Or Uncle donald versus what you need and every character, every character ended their sequence if you will in this storytelling

380
00:50:27,380 --> 00:51:09,365
structure with he needs a car. It wasn't he wants a car. You're absolutely right, Sir. It never dawned on me. To even think. In that first, it was what do you want donald Uncle donald. It wasn't what do you need? That was brilliant in in his storytelling techs. Yeah. I really like this element of it because I think to me, we get we get this rule of three thing. Right? Barks is really good about his comedic rule of three. We've got three breakdowns here. And the third breakdown is what finally clears them in. I think most readers by then are seeing that it's screaming obvious. Right, that it is what he needs. And so to me, there's a lot of humor in their in there like oblivious

381
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:18,891
because the reader is just wants to like shake them. Like, it's a car. It's a car. So I think it would probably be common to read it Al, like they're being frustrating

382
00:51:19,764 --> 00:51:20,264
naive,

383
00:51:20,643 --> 00:51:29,987
but I it's just it's just funny to me. It is they're like this dent. When they're usually very very bright. So, yeah, we we see

384
00:51:30,366 --> 00:51:32,224
grandma and her adorable

385
00:51:32,643 --> 00:51:54,521
little buggy heads to the store to order one for him. And then we transition into really a neat little sequence where Donald remembers his bargain, and he goes to the toy store, and he asks that one of those building sets be delivered Christmas morning. And he stops himself as he leaves. Because he has that great stereotypical

386
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:55,519
adult

387
00:51:55,897 --> 00:52:03,360
recollection. That wait, there's three of them better by three of them else they're gonna fight. And this this is what's gonna happen

388
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,620
in sequence with each of the relatives. Right?

389
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,860
Daisy is doing some last minute shopping.

390
00:52:10,473 --> 00:52:25,005
And she takes it upon herself because, you know, she's thinking. I don't wanna see the boys miss out so I'm gonna go by them some something. And she talks herself into three sets, and we we flash

391
00:52:25,503 --> 00:53:15,847
to sc in his in his money tub. Thinking to himself that that that tight law Donald won't by his nephews a thing so he directs Jarvis, his butler to go to the Toy store and buy a building set. And, again, we get that cap where he corrects himself, better make it three. Else they're gonna fight all the time. Did anyone else read that service go down to a toy store and buy a building set in Iron man's points I I definitely thought of thought of the Ai. Yeah. This time. And so we see Gladstone do the same thing. All of these relatives are coming to the same realization, but they're doing it in different ways. Right? Right. Daisy is doing it to be sweet. Scrooge is doing it to be sweet in his own way. But he's being cast as very grumpy,

392
00:53:16,225 --> 00:53:18,060
and reluctant at the same time.

393
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:19,713
Gladstone

394
00:53:19,753 --> 00:53:32,204
wants to show off, he wants to have a little icing on the cake. When he delivers the car, so he goes in search of the most expensive toys and decides to spring for three sets

395
00:53:32,581 --> 00:53:34,077
and and grandma.

396
00:53:34,494 --> 00:53:45,297
Go go for a line. No. No. I was just gonna suggest we go all the way back to the beginning when Donald did it to fulfill a bargain. And that was he was happy to do it. Yeah. So... I I liked I like the little

397
00:53:45,930 --> 00:54:07,467
expression that he's got as he does and like, hey, at least the kids will have a nice christmas. You know be that part. Yeah. He was he was definitely a jerk in the beginning, and I could seen a way for him to have, like posed it more as a game than a threat. You know? But we get a little bit of, like, we get some nice caring and warmth from him at the end lease. I did wanna point out that

398
00:54:08,243 --> 00:54:09,820
the super builder

399
00:54:10,157 --> 00:54:10,657
that

400
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:11,712
Gladstone

401
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:25,871
gets is one hundred dollars. And apparently, that's not even the most expensive gift that they have at the Toy store. Those are all sold out. The hundred dollar building sets in nineteen fifty would be worth

402
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,069
one thousand

403
00:54:27,447 --> 00:54:32,035
one hundred sixty six dollars and fifty nine cents. Due to inflation,

404
00:54:32,495 --> 00:54:33,235
which is

405
00:54:33,575 --> 00:54:34,075
wow.

406
00:54:34,455 --> 00:54:35,235
Yeah. Like

407
00:54:35,575 --> 00:54:37,075
yeah for your three nephews.

408
00:54:37,415 --> 00:54:43,911
That's a pretty big flex. That's clearly where where all the motors are gonna come the the end from those deluxe ones.

409
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:46,225
So Grandma Ducktales the final

410
00:54:46,684 --> 00:55:08,129
relative to walk into the store and just know the don to scatter brain to remember to buy gifts for his nephews. So she goes in does the same thing. But she says send one of those sets to Dun Barks house, make it three. They now are all set. And, of course, my one of my favorite little character moments is the clerk is just so happy. I.

411
00:55:08,908 --> 00:55:09,906
You've made his day.

412
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,660
I love

413
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:47,430
there. Yeah. Is it that great I knew it? I do it. I do it. But the next morning, you've got this classic Christmas snow covered duck burger moment is Christmas morning, and you hear the joy from all the different houses in the neighborhood. But that that the docks, these just the other kids in the neighborhood. And so the doorbell rings the boys wake up. Donald is g and says go get the go answer of the door, there might be Al delivery man with your building set. So he's explaining now from bed that he got them the building size. Hey, Warren. Isn't that panel just so lovely? Oh it is. It's it's not christmas learning at all. It's

414
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:58,000
it's it's a wonderful life. It's it's a it's your classic Christmas panel. Yeah. But think, Sarah. I thought it was really calm, and I like the touch of the gold,

415
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:58,880
yellow,

416
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:05,615
steep and the trees that have had shed their leaves, but there's still a fur yeah. Very.

417
00:56:06,115 --> 00:56:11,175
Very calming But donald, it looks up and and says go get your building sets, so they're being delivered.

418
00:56:11,475 --> 00:56:23,265
They there we see the five delivery men, or we see the legs of the the one on the far left And they have all the different versions of the builder set. I I love that. I'm glad you pointed out early about glad getting the

419
00:56:23,565 --> 00:56:24,385
super builder.

420
00:56:24,725 --> 00:56:26,945
Yeah. Because they're all by Jiffy builder.

421
00:56:27,325 --> 00:56:37,240
There's deluxe builder and their super builders there's different versions of it so they can connect whatever they their hearts and minds imagine. So fifteen buildings sets

422
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:56,533
Donald gets up. And this is the sort of the unveil now of the payoff of all the kindness and all the payback But donald gets up runs to his window opens it up, delivery men everywhere. And then the sort of disbelief that there are four new automobiles for me for me, Donald Inducks, and each one is a

423
00:56:57,069 --> 00:57:03,326
representation of the buyer. Except for uncle Scrooge jump Al little. Yeah. That deep is a little bit confusing.

424
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:11,944
Yeah. Yeah. No. Thank you. You guys that jeep is perfect. What year is this? Nineteen fifty. Nice empty.

425
00:57:12,543 --> 00:57:17,097
It's a war surplus jeep. Yep. After world four two, He got... He got it for cheap.

426
00:57:18,096 --> 00:57:19,890
Oh, wow remember the

427
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,050
from volcano Valley service

428
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:23,030
Barks.

429
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:26,450
And yeah. Where's was... That would have been.

430
00:57:27,045 --> 00:57:32,495
It would have been obvious back then that that... But it reads weird. It's like, oh, that's kinda

431
00:57:32,913 --> 00:57:33,413
utilitarian.

432
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:57,964
Maybe that's how it works. But no. He picked it up from from uncle Sam for song. Great call Barks. I'm glad you did. I I love that then it makes so much sense. And then, of course, Daisy car is freely and it's got the little french on the hood, and it's got the little skirt or the lay on bottom. Grandma duck was just practical and bought the grandma Inducks would buy. And of course, Glad stones got the char

433
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:10,516
import with the red tires. That's donald great surprise for that morning. I love... I love this page. The this this is section neat that have grown up wish fulfillment and child

434
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:11,489
fulfillment,

435
00:58:11,827 --> 00:58:16,275
but it's like, grown up wish fulfillment from the perspective of a child.

436
00:58:16,612 --> 00:58:20,441
What do you think sarah of those different cars that reflect the givers?

437
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:24,395
I... Carl Barks is such a master

438
00:58:24,695 --> 00:58:25,515
at character.

439
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,715
And any tool he can he uses

440
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:47,681
and this is just another example of that. Obviously, I was confused by the jeep, but the I could tell who which one was you know, without reading the tags. Right. So each car was from. It's just... They're so good. Mh. And and even glad stones even the tag

441
00:58:48,017 --> 00:58:52,321
he's underlined his name to be like this is from Gladstone.

442
00:58:53,491 --> 00:58:55,744
Grandma was the only one to wish Mary Christmas.

443
00:58:56,518 --> 00:58:59,130
To gray. And then Donald

444
00:58:59,466 --> 00:59:04,335
to the boys and... Yahoo. Who, y. This is a mary Christmas ever,

445
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,132
and the kids ask

446
00:59:07,284 --> 00:59:26,094
what are you gonna do with four automobiles and Donald says he's just gonna have a lot of fun picking which one to write? As an adult, I I developed the favorite probably and then just drive that one exclusively give the rest of away like. I would have a hard time accepting them. And then if somebody was, like, insisted

447
00:59:26,553 --> 00:59:29,051
or if it was in the case of uncle Scrooge or...

448
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:30,908
Where... Or Gladstone

449
00:59:31,108 --> 00:59:45,311
where I was look, he's it's fine. I would just be like, okay, either, you know, sell it or give it to somebody else, know spread the wealth But donald, of course is not so anonymous. He's just going to choose... He's just gonna have fun using.

450
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:50,006
And I think that's probably, like playing to that little kid sen

451
00:59:50,680 --> 01:00:18,225
Right? Oh, I can drive a different car Severino day. Right? Right. But the kids are a little bit more practical. As far as scalability, and I kept thinking about that, Like, oh, I bet they're gonna make something really good with that because, you know, you can't use four cars that once, but you can use fifteen e sets at time and make something just really awesome. And they already have plans. And so later on,

452
01:00:18,526 --> 01:00:35,635
Donald is trying to get everybody rounded up so that they can go to grandma's for turkey dinner, and they just, like, can't be bothered. So he leaves without them and gets to the dora at grandma's as he decides to to drive the one that she gave him to show his thanks

453
01:00:36,335 --> 01:00:41,610
and he arrives and it says grandma, the boys just wouldn't come. And she's at the door and

454
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:45,950
she's pointing behind him and says that's what you think Donald look behind you.

455
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:54,092
And the kids have arrived with a giant quad peddle dog looking thing that they've built with their e set

456
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:59,690
singing jingle bells from the top of it. Yeah. What what a great closing

457
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,730
panel. I I think this is a masterpiece

458
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:09,538
conclusion. Right? Because we've got it it does a little hack need Christmas thing where the other members of the family

459
01:01:10,035 --> 01:01:25,455
all show up together, which maybe isn't isn't too realistic, but it's cute and it's warm, and it just feels like such a neat bit of kid wish fulfillment. You know, the idea that we're gonna use all these that to to create something really cool

460
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:28,175
that gives us a little bit of independence.

461
01:01:28,595 --> 01:01:39,195
I love that. As a kid this was my favorite panel. I I remember this panel. And when I saw it again reading it this time, it brought back so many memories, and I think it was that sort of final

462
01:01:39,534 --> 01:02:13,790
Merry Christmas wish to the family from a family and everybody that's in the story, the main characters are in this panel, and it's just a Christmas greeting. And Sarah, you described that that animal or whenever they're they're riding on beautifully, it's the familiar, the snow and the house. And the extremely absurd and unfamiliar all mixed together and one, and it's just... It's because it's just a classic panel. Great way to close the story. Yeah. What you think of the conclusion there, Sarah? Thought it was adorable. I was very excited to see that I was right about the scalability of their building sets Yeah. Fifteen. And

463
01:02:14,385 --> 01:02:17,765
they they did a good job because, of course, they did.

464
01:02:18,225 --> 01:02:20,005
I'd liked the articulation

465
01:02:20,505 --> 01:02:27,694
of the like, the limbs of this monster thing they created to right around down it

466
01:02:28,273 --> 01:02:30,705
It does look very much like a dog

467
01:02:31,284 --> 01:02:37,995
as far as, like, where the joints are and stuff I think this one was my favorite panel for sure. Nice.

468
01:02:38,768 --> 01:03:11,885
I like too that it looks... It looks fantastic but it also looks just realistic enough. You know, where you where you can imagine it. Really really neat little closer there. So, yeah. What what are your overall thoughts on this one warren? You you alluded to this being your favorite of the big Christmas stories. It is and I and as as I said earlier it it... I just love the outcome. I... The way it started, there was a little bit of that and I'll just classify it again as a a sort of selfish push motive from everyone through Scrooge, so you can't break him from his mold, but

469
01:03:12,439 --> 01:03:14,574
And and so it's Gladstone, but there were such...

470
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:21,632
But when you had that su streak in the Net at the beginning and then donald, then there was the shift to kindness

471
01:03:22,025 --> 01:03:30,520
and gift giving, which I really liked and all five characters are in there. I mean, you've got the the family rather with Grandma, making a cameo oh and

472
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:33,794
everybody just... To me, it was just a classic Christmas

473
01:03:34,132 --> 01:03:47,968
story Inducks berg with classic behaviors by all the characters. It sorta of came full circle for me as a as Inducks fan. Awesome. How about she's here. What are your overall thoughts on this one? I thought this one was very beat. It wasn't

474
01:03:48,505 --> 01:03:49,005
exciting.

475
01:03:49,383 --> 01:03:50,162
It was

476
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:51,678
so well

477
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:52,915
characterized

478
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:54,445
that it wasn't

479
01:03:55,065 --> 01:03:56,765
surprising or jarring

480
01:03:57,105 --> 01:04:00,125
And so it felt like it would be a good comforting

481
01:04:00,825 --> 01:04:01,325
solid

482
01:04:01,825 --> 01:04:02,685
and enjoyable

483
01:04:03,065 --> 01:04:13,912
comment. To read as a kid. Yeah. For sure. I I loved reading this one as a kid. I really love this one. This one, I think think you described it really well. It's very comforting.

484
01:04:14,491 --> 01:04:18,386
Both you described well, because it has a lot of nice, like, warmth thin kindness

485
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:23,631
just a couple of discord parts. But it almost feels like a a classic

486
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:24,509
Christmas

487
01:04:24,967 --> 01:04:31,312
special a Tv special, you know? And like you were saying Sarah. It it really is all about the

488
01:04:31,851 --> 01:04:34,309
characterization in this one. None of the characters

489
01:04:34,968 --> 01:04:39,913
apart from Donald and the kids are even in it that long, but there's just so much

490
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:41,030
character,

491
01:04:41,606 --> 01:04:43,382
you know, not development. But

492
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:45,376
the the story is really

493
01:04:45,833 --> 01:05:10,737
drawn out of who these characters are. And and that makes it really really fun to rate. If you look at the the splash panel at the end, the the panel we love that that pays off the story. And then if you go back like I did to the first panel, mark the one you beautifully described as that that big full page I just saw that there's a little fore foreshadowing going on here with a yellow car on the window. Just think about that for a minute and

494
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:16,950
So I don't know if federal Barks is was playing a joke on us or if he just knew what he was gonna get into,

495
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:31,105
but I wanted to bring that up I'm glad you did. Yeah. When we we're looking at it this time, I was like, Oh look at that. That that car is going to be a gift. Or at least a car is gonna be a gift. Oh, it was there the whole time.

496
01:05:31,825 --> 01:05:36,260
Yeah. It's hard for me when I think about, like, the three famous Christmas stories.

497
01:05:36,755 --> 01:05:41,295
And and there's no reason to pit them against each other other than it makes for a good topic

498
01:05:41,675 --> 01:05:42,175
conversation

499
01:05:42,635 --> 01:05:48,778
But you like this one better than shaq town and San and letter her to Santa Warren. Well, I like I'd like letter to Santa.

500
01:05:49,315 --> 01:05:54,255
Shack down. I would put third, but I would say this is probably a close second

501
01:05:55,112 --> 01:06:00,137
updated I be letter to santos is probably a close second to this one for other reasons. But, yeah. How about you?

502
01:06:01,015 --> 01:06:06,712
I love letter to santa, but it's like kinda two story. Right? And I like that steam.

503
01:06:07,247 --> 01:06:35,655
Part more than I do, the kind of santa apart at the end. So I would say that the the first half of letter to Santa is my favorite of them. But this one, this one might work best overall. But but there's something about the Shack town. It's really a big emotional punch too. Yeah. It's more epic I will say and even in a way letter to Santa is a little bit more of an epic story. Yeah. So that's a hard one. Like, if you if you would asked me before I revisited,

504
01:06:36,089 --> 01:06:54,895
letter to Santa. I probably would have said that letter to Santa was or or rather Shack town is my favorite And this third, but they're all really great in their own way. So. I'll have to think about that when when I finally get to Shaft town, and maybe I'll have to pick. Yeah. I'll take another read of check down to. It's been a while, but

505
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:56,985
this one just brought back a lot of memories,

506
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:09,676
and I'm I'm kinda stuck in my memories as a kid. So maybe I will have you guys Barks for Shack tone. And I'll ask Sarah to do a letter to Santa for some homework and

507
01:07:10,132 --> 01:07:16,148
and and we can, you know, debate the three of them. Not again. They're they're all great, but but the community

508
01:07:16,525 --> 01:07:18,619
has its own idea. And

509
01:07:19,434 --> 01:07:23,856
this one is is highly regarded. Those three are are definitely

510
01:07:24,194 --> 01:07:34,890
like the hop of Barks Christmas stories. So this one rates quite highly. It's a seven point seven on index, which is good for one hundred and thirteen.

511
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:38,930
Out of all forty one thousand or so. So

512
01:07:39,365 --> 01:07:39,865
Shaft

513
01:07:40,364 --> 01:07:55,990
is definitely his highest rate by the community and I believe that Santa letter san to out this one by a little bit. But but not quite as much. I might need to double check that though. In general, I think this one holds up pretty well apart from that sequence

514
01:07:56,824 --> 01:08:00,595
with with the mind reader, which just is is a little needlessly

515
01:08:01,132 --> 01:08:02,350
mean although,

516
01:08:02,807 --> 01:08:11,373
I should I should acknowledge that Donald private thoughts are his own private thoughts. And he had the good grace not to say anything.

517
01:08:11,885 --> 01:08:13,065
She was insulted

518
01:08:13,445 --> 01:08:40,145
by thoughts that he kept to himself until she read his mind. So I admire Barks your... When you do read this to your daughter, and when I read this to my granddaughter, which I wanna start reading the dex stories to her. She's now four. And I think we'll she'd loves sitting through stories, but I love the disclaimers you can give on the characterization because I think that's really important. To let them know that this isn't appropriate or this isn't what we're looking at get their reaction. I thought that was beautiful.

519
01:08:40,522 --> 01:08:53,335
And I think these Ducktales stories with all their side characters and even their main character behaviors are wonderful elements for teaching kids what is good? What is great? What is luck? What is this? What is that? I I think

520
01:08:53,715 --> 01:09:17,939
you've you've kind of convinced me to not just read these stories, but read through these stories with with the little ones. Yeah. It is a great opportunity. Right? Because I love these stories deeply, But there are definitely parts that I I do think it's important to contextualize eyes and you know, tell her okay, this this was something that he wrote seventy years ago. And generally, today, we wouldn't do this or or

521
01:09:18,276 --> 01:09:19,933
sometimes people today

522
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:27,527
still do the this and I I don't think it's right, but but it's just a good a good opportunity to have those conversations.

523
01:09:27,944 --> 01:09:44,763
See any any closing thoughts guys anything we didn't get to cover that you really wanted to mention. I I do think it's a it's a shame warren that... And and someone on the Barks Facebook page had pointed this out in response to a question I asked once. I asked once

524
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:55,670
what lit the graph or oil painting. Do you wish Barks have gotten around to? And someone had suggested that, you know, the closing panel of this would have been a really nice subject.

525
01:09:56,046 --> 01:10:34,980
Well, I think it would have. Oh, yeah. There so many though. The more we do these and the more I look at at these comics and more I say, oh, just think about what he his editing process of saying, no... I'm not gonna do that one. And he did far more oil paintings than he did look the graphs, of course. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And then I I guess I didn't... I... We've talked about some panels we really liked. But are there any favorite panels that we didn't get to mention or that anyone wants to highlight? No. But I always appreciate when you do bring attention to the art because I do my things sometimes where I get stuck in read mode, and I can't switch to picture mode So I really appreciate

526
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:46,085
when you point out little things like that car in the window, warren or just everything. I like the attention that you give in this podcast. And I hope it's useful

527
01:10:46,585 --> 01:10:55,653
to listeners who may... Might not have a copy of of this economic rate in front of them. To hear us talk about various panels.

528
01:10:56,030 --> 01:11:17,071
Yeah. And i think was and aside from the splash panels that we talked about and some of the wonderful artwork work that Sarah pointing out. Think this is another great. It was a cluster of panels that really stood out, and it was little mini scenes like the the the incredibly long list of things that they... That they thought donald wanted, and then you jump to the next page and it's donald fighting on the couch.

529
01:11:17,604 --> 01:12:15,649
Those little sequences are just classic in in itself. Maybe for me, it was... The Nephews who kinda nominated this story early on and and throughout in a way way. I love their their moments, I guess. And it's probably one of my favorites. Awesome. Yeah. That there are a ton of great panels in this one. And most of my favorites are super predictable, you know, the the end one and the beginning one and the the automobiles. But I gotta come back to that one with Gladstone with his long face because it it's cracking me up ever since I kid. Yeah. That's a winner. And and I I do love this story. You know, this one is is so much fun and I love the way that he constructed it in a way where the story almost tells itself. Right? He like puts it. He puts it on this track and we get to see this relative come into the story and handle things in their way. And the next one, and then they all come together in the end in a way that is to me really satisfying.

530
01:12:16,107 --> 01:12:23,901
So I I think I think this is a great story. Holds up really well. And i'm delighted we got to talk about it. So

531
01:12:24,336 --> 01:12:31,970
I look forward to having you guys back again at some point really soon very soon. It happens because

532
01:12:32,347 --> 01:12:42,273
in in our podcast order, I'm gonna be pushing out dangerous to Disguise next week after this one. So hopefully, listeners will

533
01:12:42,612 --> 01:12:44,988
enjoy coming back. I I think we had an awesome

534
01:12:45,446 --> 01:12:52,067
conversation for that one because we've already recorded that. I'm very happy how that turned out. So if if listeners
