00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:08,874
we

00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:32,385
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks.

This episode is a ten page podcast, all about one of his short stories get ready to enjoy our remarks.

00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:42,450
Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever a Grown man who's still enjoys comics and yet managed to marry a woman who will put up with that.

4
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:44,081
And

5
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:46,434
we are recording a special

6
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:47,989
valentine's themed

7
00:00:48,446 --> 00:01:03,532
episode of Barks remarks today, and we're gonna talk about two Carl Barks ten page stories, So who who better to do a Valentine's podcast with and my wife. Why don't you introduce yourself? My wife?

8
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:10,761
Hi, everybody. I'm Suzanne, Aka missus Mark. I am not a a comics fan,

9
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:25,970
but I am an art lover. Yeah. And and a Barks lover. No. Well, yes. Those without saying. Al. Happy Valentine's day. Absolutely. I got you an episode of the podcast. Oh, good. Thanks. This just what I wanted. Well, we're we're recording this

10
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:31,215
about a week before. So, you know, still still time. So listeners,

11
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:39,160
you should send Barks some good Valentine's day gift ideas. Oh, don't worry. It is well in the mail. I'm not making that mistake again.

12
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,099
So

13
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:44,295
Valentine's stay is is one of those holidays

14
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:49,784
right where someone who's contributing to a monthly comic book they have a hook,

15
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:53,560
they feel, like they've gotta do a themed story.

16
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:59,574
But I don't think that Carl Barks was ever into the Valentine's day stories.

17
00:02:00,614 --> 00:02:04,206
The way he was into to, like, Christmas, and even halloween

18
00:02:04,744 --> 00:02:11,711
because the list of Al valentine's themed stories it doesn't include, like, a lot of very esteem.

19
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:18,276
Stories. And and the two that we're gonna talk about today, I think they're perfectly fine but

20
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:32,060
they're not classics, like some of his Christmas ones or even some of his Halloween ones. So I should know that neither of these stories really contain any romance at all. I I think that especially

21
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:43,965
an audience of probably young boys who were reading these bottles com. We're really not interested in Donald romantic T prevail. But, you know, both of these stories

22
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:50,888
managed to kind of stick with the formula of being very action oriented and mad cap and a random

23
00:02:51,626 --> 00:03:01,010
kind of happenings and you know, Valentine's day is really just a v over these stories. And they're they're really... I would say very much in the vein of the other stories I've read.

24
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:05,004
Yeah. That... That's a very good point. Barks knew his audience.

25
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,325
Valentine's day is a romantic

26
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:08,165
holiday,

27
00:03:08,504 --> 00:03:17,840
but these are not meant to be very romantic stories. They're meant to me mad cat they're meant to be funny and entertaining. I and and they certainly are.

28
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:24,502
I should mention the actual stories because I haven't said the titles yet. We're gonna be talking about My lucky Valentine

29
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,349
and wild about flowers. And you'll notice that wild about flowers is not actually

30
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:38,324
like, a valentine valentine's story, but it is a roman romance story. Right? And my my lucky Valentine

31
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:40,044
really is not.

32
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:52,510
So I wanted to kinda get a good mix here. And so, I think that one of the the other things to keep in mind about Carl Barks is that at the point He was writing these,

33
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:53,944
which were in

34
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:54,781
nineteen

35
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:56,135
forty nine

36
00:03:56,711 --> 00:04:06,030
and nineteen fifty two, I believe. Right? He was like forty eight or fifty one was just finishing up an unhappy marriage.

37
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:18,731
His his second marriage, you know, he used a few years away from his third final marriage, which by Al accounts was very happy, but this one wasn't So I don't know if Carl Barks really

38
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:19,887
re list

39
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:26,323
doing valentine valentine's or or loved themed stories, but that's just kinda something that's in the Barks of my head

40
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:35,580
now as as a grown up. And he also was before before this comment career, he was a gag man, doing some of the stories.

41
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:39,039
The ga writing gag for the old donald duck cartoons.

42
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,014
You know, compared to those cartoons, these are, like, practically

43
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,887
enlightened in their treatment

44
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:46,839
of of romance

45
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:48,771
if they're still very like,

46
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:50,028
opposition

47
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:52,633
and the woman is a prize.

48
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:58,904
But in the cartoons, I would say it's much sure. So that's kinda what's in the back of my mind. So

49
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:13,379
for the for the ten page podcast, these are much less researched. We're gonna be a little bit looser and more free flowing with I would like to talk first about the earliest comment which is wild about flowers.

50
00:05:14,392 --> 00:05:18,920
Before we talk about the comic, it's also notable that both of these stories are gonna feature

51
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:31,439
donald in a rivalry with his cousin Gladstone gander. Were you familiar with Glad gander beforehand? I was not. Gladstone is new to me. What do you what do you think about him?

52
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:32,179
You know,

53
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:42,298
a lot of the media from this time kind of had this trope where there was a a male character who was kind of a bit of a squash,

54
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:44,656
a guy who could do no wrong.

55
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:50,224
And, you know, is was considered very attractive and kind of put in

56
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:53,064
kind of the standard role of romantic rival.

57
00:05:53,524 --> 00:06:02,786
So I I instantly kind of recognized him as a type. Actually, I will say in the first panel, I was kind of shocked to see how kind of visually similar.

58
00:06:03,244 --> 00:06:10,174
I think he he looks to donald, and I had to kind of do a double take to make sure, Okay, This is a different character.

59
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:26,053
So, you know, in the arts style. Obviously, they're both Inducks, but, you know, they they both very much kind of come from the same apologies. So, you know, in order to kind of differentiate, they kinda give him a little bit of different kind of hair and the eyes are john slightly differently

60
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,537
and Gladstone seems to be a little bit haul than Donald.

61
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:36,794
We're even kind bringing those ideas of the ideal human ph over to Docs. Yeah.

62
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:44,698
Know I don't know if and if, you know, in the the natural kingdom is being taller dog

63
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:46,415
has considered

64
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:58,488
Al advantage in their beauty standard. When does you think about his his luck? That's that's the stick with wisdom stone. Is that he's he's very lucky. And in this story,

65
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:00,206
you know, it's it's

66
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:15,696
I gotta see. It's a little bit of a reach to hang this much luck on one character. It's... I I have to say I found this story. This is the the story about the flowers. You know, I found it fairly hard to believe because everything that happens,

67
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:22,850
in in every action, Gladstone manages to ruin Donald flower that he was trying to bring to Daisy.

68
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:28,585
So... But it's it's it's a cute little trope. Sure. Yeah. Gladstone

69
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:35,010
is is fun, I think in like some of them... Some of the adventure stories his luck is a little more over the top.

70
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:39,020
I really enjoy glad stone in kind of small doses.

71
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:45,420
But you you can tell when you read a lot of the stories that have him that Barks really doesn't like Gladstone.

72
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:48,409
He's just really meant to be that foil

73
00:07:48,867 --> 00:08:00,161
Donald, you know. And so that's what he's gonna be in in this one writ large. He's very much that type of, you know, the the character who's always a little bit better than we are.

74
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,595
And, you know, Donald is charming be in part because he has

75
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:13,685
his flaws because he gets a little too angry lives too quickly, and he falls down a lot and, you know, he's kind of it's kind of a goof and

76
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:24,050
But that's what also what makes him in engineering. And, you know, Gladstone just obviously doesn't have any of that, you know? Yeah. He's really meant to be a kind of a stand for

77
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,870
anybody who's is, you know,

78
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,230
better than anything.

79
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:39,265
Yeah. Alright. So so let's do it. Let's talk about wild about flowers and this this one is... I would say that this is like almost a kara

80
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:40,582
version

81
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,350
of a little boys. Cartoon ish understanding of Romance.

82
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:46,384
Absolutely.

83
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:53,526
Right. Like it romance, what do you think about Rome when you think about romance do you think about giving girls flowers,

84
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:58,840
you think about being like, a a night whoop in rescue

85
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:06,877
a helpless woman. So So in some ways, I think I think Barks really knew his audience here because it's almost cartoon

86
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:14,707
Juvenile. It's very much that old school cord. Yes. It's very old school and and it's gonna commit

87
00:09:15,243 --> 00:09:19,825
the sin that makes stories like these not hold up very well of having

88
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:24,969
the female interest be nothing more than a price

89
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:30,549
to be one. And and daisy is, like super passive. It fails the Barks tax.

90
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:34,340
Yes. Yes. These are all gonna fail for that dell test.

91
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:35,495
Because

92
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:42,215
the the number of female characters can generally be counted on on one nothing. But...

93
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:43,735
Well, the other

94
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,990
thing that really stood out to me about this character

95
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,790
about this story specifically is that Daisy character

96
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:54,420
is basically oblivious to everything that happens.

97
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:56,957
In a way that I have just never

98
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:10,013
found unbelievable. You know, this is another very common trope in the this type of romance story. It where, you know, there's this huge rivalry of all of this action that takes place and the innocent woman

99
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:13,728
doesn't even notice any of it happening. It's

100
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:15,207
so incredible

101
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:16,165
that

102
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:22,007
that to be honest, I've never really been able to enjoy these kinds of stories because they just don't

103
00:10:22,385 --> 00:10:27,192
seem relatable in any way. Yeah. She She really might as well be furniture in this one.

104
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:30,409
Alright. So let's talk about this ten pager.

105
00:10:30,948 --> 00:10:34,699
We don't need to detail every bit of the plot, but Basically,

106
00:10:35,513 --> 00:10:39,099
this sets up a contest in Ducktales

107
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:52,878
during spring, there there is a club called the Duck wild flower club, and what they do is they head to the hills to hunt for da. And and the premise is that the first Fellow who presented a daisy

108
00:10:53,296 --> 00:11:10,366
to a girl gets to be her partner for the picnic lunch. And, you know, so Donald the course is very excited at the prospect of being the one to deliver that daisy too daisy, which is cute right? Like, it's it's neat that he's looking for a daisy for Daisy. And

109
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:21,192
we get these like first three panels that are, like, over the top She's got like the ke pose and long batting eyelashes and he's he's kind of jumping

110
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:30,871
in in that sort of loves truck manner, and he heads off to hunt four flowers along the Creek bed, and he gets interrupted by Glad stone who

111
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:34,598
who who wants in on this deal as well. And everything

112
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:59,750
that, you know, Donald does where he'll find it daisy and be headed towards daisy duck to bring it to her, you know, Gladstone will do something. Like, I think he toss this his watch or something. And, of course, the watch lands right on the daisy that Donald was bringing. So, you know, the the the trope is is repeated a number of times during the story that Glad stone

113
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,104
and his good luck interferes

114
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:15,270
Donald. Yeah, and I think we get the rule of three here. I think that Barks is pretty good about about following that sort of comedy rule of three because but like you were saying, Gladstone not bothering.

115
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,870
To actually search for a daisy.

116
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:29,876
He just stands next to her bragging about how great he is bragging about how thanks to his luck he doesn't need to and the boys to side that they're gonna help Donald

117
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:34,984
because, you know, they can't stand to see Glad stone bragging about his his

118
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:36,240
his good luck.

119
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:43,115
And and so the first incident, you're right, he tossed is you wanna tell us what he does the first time. He toss

120
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:44,695
I believe it his watch.

121
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:52,770
On a chain. Oh, the first one is just his oh just a rock. Okay. In the first one, he toss Gladstone over his shoulder.

122
00:12:53,184 --> 00:12:56,518
And the stone lands right on Donald tan that's clutch

123
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:07,996
the flower and it sm the flower. Right. The the boys have successfully found Correct. And then he does the same thing with a stick over his shoulder,

124
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,345
which hits a hornet. Nest

125
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:11,385
and

126
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:13,045
donald, but... Yes.

127
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:22,702
And, yeah, it's it's gonna be the rule of three. It's gonna be that quick the the third incident is gonna be the watch that you mentioned because... For a key chain.

128
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:42,375
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Key chain. He decides that because of an ensuing rains storm, he's gotta get rid of it. So he he throws the key chain. It lands on Donald tail, and then lightning strikes Donald tail. And it doesn't deliver a flower this time, but it delivers the umbrella that but trying

129
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:46,515
because, you know, girls always need to have umbrellas. Right.

130
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:49,255
I I like the little

131
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,550
flo he did here of just showing, like, in the panel borders

132
00:13:53,930 --> 00:14:01,403
hey daisy, and then these weird puns with some other flowers like a butter cup and a cow slip that was kinda neat. So

133
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:07,796
anyway, there there's some fun very like spring. It definitely evo spring to me this story. Absolutely.

134
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:22,506
I have to say this panel of Donald getting getting shocked and getting it by the lightning is pretty funny. Is pretty funny. Yeah. There's some really nice individual funny panels the the devilish looking be that Chase Donald was pretty funny. But

135
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:31,420
the the story gets serious pretty quickly. Right? After the after the little rule of three, where Gladstone shows him up three times.

136
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:35,150
The Nephews are convincing Donald to give up.

137
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:39,095
When this flash flood has been triggered

138
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:44,200
by the cloud burst that's broken the damn. And so we get this

139
00:14:44,657 --> 00:14:48,570
we get that scene that I alluded to where

140
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,290
Daisy is going to need to be rescued,

141
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:57,900
which is, you know, every... Again, I I feel like that's every little boys kind of juvenile mind

142
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,070
idea of rome hints is rescuing your damn. Absolutely.

143
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:05,182
And what what do you think about Glad stone

144
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,332
taking that tree to safety?

145
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:11,620
And and not really thinking about Daisy there at all.

146
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:17,115
It seems very on point for his door. Yeah. Gladstone is is about Gladstone.

147
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:20,750
So daisy immediately like reg into just

148
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:22,626
completely helpless

149
00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:43,473
running in place and screaming. And the the flight is pretty cool. But Donald has to, like, help her out of the way and on to a a tree branch. And and again, we get these little comedic bits where they're occupying a tree branch with the bulldog on it that Donald has to fight. And so she keeps saying help speech help.

150
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,563
Is is the little repeated element with Daisy.

151
00:15:47,122 --> 00:16:07,919
And and Gladstone very conveniently is able to rescue her from that log in a gon that happens to to flow by and And susan this was a pretty early comic for me, I I read this one quite often because it it was in an album of Donald and Daisy comics that I had as a kid and I never wondered at that time how he happens to get a gon

152
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:20,640
in duck birth. Maybe Duck is you know, just down the coast from venice. And it couldn't tell. I mean, the Gladstone luck, you know? But but the boys also conveniently have gotten a

153
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:32,849
speed boat, and they grab donald and all of the Inducks and encounter again daisy screeching while Gladstone is Al lazy in his gon because they're both heading for a waterfall,

154
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:38,405
and Gladstone rep is thirties like calm down, You don't... You're not gonna come to harm as long as you're with

155
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:39,900
Lucky Gladstone.

156
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:45,082
You know it did occur to me, though? What's that? Duck can fly. Inducks can't... Well, yes.

157
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,257
But we're... As always

158
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:50,404
we are meant to think of these characters as humans.

159
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:53,797
Boy. Yes. They you know what else? They can swim.

160
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:56,910
They swim pretty well.

161
00:16:57,604 --> 00:17:06,590
Just Daisy never lets up either. She's just so helpless and so worthless the whole time. That they they end up getting pushed over the waterfall

162
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:17,345
anyway and s into the into a lake or whatever. It's a pretty cool panel of not damaging changing in the way. And Gladstone gon ends up in a tree. Yeah. Very dane.

163
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:30,861
Totally on Ruffled hold. And and Donald just by the end of the story, Donald has had enough. He can't take it and and he's gotta inflate some violence. Right. I'm Gladstone.

164
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:41,528
It might be time for him to work on a few things? Yes. It definitely needs to work on himself. This is a great panel here. Where we're Daisy and the nephews are are listening

165
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:43,740
hearing the fight in the background.

166
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,247
They... And they're all clutch plugging their ears to the violence.

167
00:17:47,584 --> 00:18:03,231
Daisy is win and the nephews are all just beam. It's ridiculous. They are so messed up from the that donald that Daisy doesn't wanna have anything to do with either of them and she storms off saying, I'll eat with the first gentleman.

168
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:12,920
That finds me a daisy. And we've read a really cute little calls them disgraceful ru in. Yeah. Yeah. It's very like, very high minded.

169
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,460
It's a cute little closer so. What how does the story end?

170
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:35,500
She ends up eating with the the three nephews. Right. They they conveniently find three days he's there and so... And and they're not... They're obviously not interested in the romance. I don't think any of them are they're really interested in the delicious picnic. Right. And they have a good time, and Daisy gets to

171
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:44,986
actually finally eat a meal after her very busy afternoon. You know, obviously one of these stories where the romance will really just have to come later.

172
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:46,298
Seriously.

173
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:48,510
The daisy Barks

174
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:59,181
I don't think he ever really knows what to do with Daisy. You know, She's not she's not very appealing to me and most of these stories. She's at her most appealing when she's like talking to the nephews.

175
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:16,062
But I definitely... I'm not a big fan of these stories where she's like, a prize and it and it... The story just calls for her to be helpless and stupid. And like you said, kind of Al oblivious. Right. Like, can she not see that Glad down is kind of on his own supply of.

176
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:28,821
Yeah. And I mean, in the story, she's, like mostly turning her nose up at him, you know, in this specific story, but but this is I'm sure you can tell there there's a pattern of these stories where Donald Gladstone.

177
00:19:29,315 --> 00:19:30,175
Right. Constantly

178
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:46,501
competing. And I also want be, like, girl. There's more than two choices. Yeah. Like there's not only two boy docs in the world. Right. Or you could go for no doc and just be... Girl be single. It's okay. Well, you know, nineteen fifty. Right. No. Not not gonna happen.

179
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:48,095
Although,

180
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:56,190
she is... She is dating someone who is the word of his three nephews. So there's that little bit of stopping to modern.

181
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:07,445
Alright. So you told me that you enjoyed this next one. Better. Hey. This this one is you know, about four years later. This is the

182
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:10,125
Valentine's story. Yes. This is the proper

183
00:20:10,505 --> 00:20:25,125
valentine's story. Although it's really only peripheral about the holiday. Right. Which is why I felt the need to throw in one that actually was kinda focused on romance. And in my lucky Al valentine's, this is a fun one. This this kind of throws in a few elements

184
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:43,766
because we have these, like little Parallel stories here. We have Donald doing what he very often does, which is like frantically looking for a new job. You know, so he's got that like anxiety about how he's gonna support himself, and that propel a lot of stories. And then we have the fun element of the Nephews.

185
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:48,790
Practicing for their junior wood checks merit badges.

186
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:53,261
Because what what do they want? They want to become exalted Ducktales.

187
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:58,930
And this is an element that Barks uses a few times these like over the top

188
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:08,553
promotions in the junior wood checks, which are obviously a stand in for for boy scouts of America, And then Don Rosa is gonna really take this to the extreme.

189
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:25,914
It's a fun element. There there is one thing I wanted to point out on this page that is a small detail that I actually really enjoyed. Mh One of the things that I really enjoy about kind of period pieces in general are the little visual details that

190
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:37,354
that artist or set designers will put in that kind of give a sense of time in place. Mh. And you know that when we go to the movies, sometimes I point out things as small Al lamps shades or

191
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:38,591
or furniture,

192
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:44,572
and and I really enjoy looking at that stuff. Well, anyway, the light fixture

193
00:21:45,124 --> 00:21:45,624
that

194
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,051
is on Donald desk as he's studying for his

195
00:21:49,627 --> 00:21:52,736
mailman exam. I just find so charming.

196
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,450
I think it's such a a pretty little

197
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,050
detail then it obviously resembles

198
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,090
kind of a classic bankers

199
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:05,446
brass lamp. I just found that to be a a really kind of small and and delightful little

200
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:24,100
element in a couple of the panels. Yeah. You're right. Thank you for pointing that out because that's the kind of thing I'd gloss over when I take a look at that. I'll I'll definitely reproduce that for Facebook page because that is cool. There's there's kind of some neat accessories that go along with both of what they're doing. You know, Donald is he's in the process of studying to become

201
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,100
a mailman,

202
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:38,373
And so he's got all these, like postal law books and forms and and even in Ink well, I think, in front of him. And then the junior... The the what using a pencil, He's not using Yeah. That's true. The the wood checks are

203
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:54,033
using a a practice dummy because they're looking to pass the drowning test. So, yeah, he he gets some of these details. Right? And I like the element where if they get to if they get the promotion to exalted Ducktales, they get to move the little

204
00:22:54,410 --> 00:23:04,939
the little tail on their cap to the top instead of hanging down in the back. And it's worth mentioning, this is a very snowy day It's gonna end up being a blizzard in Duck burger. And

205
00:23:05,357 --> 00:23:20,477
we... Much like this snowstorm that we just experienced that true here in here in Pitt pittsburgh. We are we are pretty pretty snowed in. Currently. So very seasonally appropriately. Many of the American listeners have encountered the storm in the last week. Right.

206
00:23:21,236 --> 00:23:22,975
And many of our scandinavian

207
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:24,133
listeners

208
00:23:24,472 --> 00:23:30,745
are... And they're laughing at us. Yeah. And so Donald, you know, they all head out to do their stuff. Donald

209
00:23:31,365 --> 00:23:37,675
is delighted to find out that he's past his test, and he can actually start working that very day. And

210
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:39,430
meanwhile Al the post office,

211
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:44,254
Glad down shows up. You wanna tell us about Glad stone

212
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:49,305
gets to the post office and and wants to send a Al to Daisy.

213
00:23:49,885 --> 00:23:56,200
And so I had the postal worker who's is not donald. The postal worker who's at the window tells

214
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:01,935
tells Glad stone that it's a bad day he can't guarantee that the mail will go through because

215
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:15,896
It's so snowy and and difficult to deliver the mail. Yeah. And I I like the closer of the page. He he kinda glare Al Gladstone because he says it's a terrible day to ask some struggling mailman to deliver a valentine.

216
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:20,731
For foreshadowing, by the way. Yes. Very effective for Foreshadowing. Donald

217
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:25,705
first assignment is to deliver a bunch of special deliveries.

218
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:36,617
He's very eager and, you know, it's noted that there is a valentine valentine's I like that the Al is bad. And again, there's some really nice little mid century details here

219
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:45,050
that again, you know, I think really kind of help create the sense of time in place. The first special delivery that Donald

220
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:48,165
delivers is a pension check to an older lady.

221
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:54,770
And, you know, you can see the kind of the way Barks has rendered the siding on her house.

222
00:24:55,623 --> 00:24:56,123
And

223
00:24:56,739 --> 00:25:02,025
the panels on the door that obviously kind of set it in this kind of north

224
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:03,341
Mil you.

225
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:08,030
You know, I'm not sure if zuckerberg is actually placed on a map anywhere, but

226
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,910
it's obviously very

227
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,050
very much in that kind of kind of apology.

228
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:17,873
You know, that kind of post war. Yeah. Definitely post for. Mh. And she's

229
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,269
with some patches.

230
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:26,706
On her dress that show her as very impoverished. Right. And then the next the next

231
00:25:27,084 --> 00:25:28,675
special delivery is

232
00:25:29,572 --> 00:25:33,302
to another older lady, and it is a letter from

233
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:41,257
her soldier son overseas, and the the woman thinks Donald for for bringing it through this terrible snowstorm

234
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:56,350
and, you know, the brick and the tree and everything is kind of nicely drawn and kinda Makes it... I think the the panels are kind of nicely composed in this one. Yeah. And and we get this neat rule of three. Right? Again because he

235
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:58,147
He very satisfying

236
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:00,662
gets these rewarding two deliveries

237
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,492
and tell about his third delivery. The third one is to

238
00:26:06,004 --> 00:26:11,234
and angry. I'm not sure if that's a... If he's supposed tough guy. He's a dog. Yeah.

239
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:33,982
But a grumpy man who says another bill from my wife's Christmas presence, and you walked all the way out here in a blizzard to deliver it. I could ring your noble neck I laughed at this because how is Donald? How the mailman man supposed to know what's in the mail? Yeah. He's not reading the mail. It's literally Al literally an example of kill a mess.

240
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:44,835
I I like this sequence a lot. I think this is my favorite rep. Really kicks donald in the booty. Yeah. Donald is seen in the last panel on this page rubbing his butt. Yeah.

241
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:54,650
Yeah. That... I I like that. This is like, very Barks that is best. So, anyway, Donald closing out his day and he's come to the last delivery.

242
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:58,920
Which he is horrified to realize is a valentine

243
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:00,798
to daisy

244
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:05,290
from. He realizes it's from Gladstone, he specifically

245
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,390
recognizes Gladstone hand handwriting.

246
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,190
And it's two miles away.

247
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:15,734
Know, a distance to cover and he does not look like he's wearing boots.

248
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:18,209
He doesn't appear to be

249
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:32,625
properly dressed for the weather? He also doesn't have a mail truck. No. No. He definitely doesn't. This... This is this is the mailman man Trope. Right? Bark wants us to think about the the, like, rain or snow or of night.

250
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,445
And so, you know, he's in this really

251
00:27:35,745 --> 00:27:36,245
frustrating

252
00:27:36,745 --> 00:27:39,216
situation where he's struggling to deliver

253
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:55,819
a letter to his girl from his rival. We get this funny a little bit here where there's a statue of a brass monkey and the ears snap off, and I'm I'm ninety eight percent sure that that's Al old saying it's cold enough to break the years off of brass monkey. So So Donald does

254
00:27:56,517 --> 00:28:01,950
what we expect he might do in this situation with the letter. Donald is flawed.

255
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:08,925
Yes Yes. Donald, Donald toss it into the blizzard and and lets the wind carry it away.

256
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:44,098
And he stew as he walks back to the to the host office. He says let the wind blow the darn thing clear to China. I'll go back and tell the post master I lost it. And we get this great sequence here where he passes a very convenient statue that's been erected and honor of mailman man Mike who never lost a letter, certainly not on his first day. Yeah. And and, you know, this is again that trope. A noble male carrier who who delivers the mail at all costs and and so glad...

257
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:47,095
So Donald feels like a complete heel.

258
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:52,950
And he resolves that he's gonna go back and get it. You know, I I don't know that there's anything too interesting

259
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,796
in the next couple of sequences where he's struggling to to get the letter back. He gets...

260
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:02,943
He gets covered by snow from a snow plow.

261
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:09,985
Nearly gets the letter the letter is being blown away. And so Donald trying to get it. He climbs

262
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:18,965
like a street light or a signal to go get it, and then it gets blown away, and at the very end, it gets blown out into the river.

263
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:35,490
Right. And and again, we get that rule of three. Right? Because you had, like, three of these little disasters, and he almost gets it And again, it's very action packed so there's a lot of sp and sp It's... Reminds me of Kathy Comics and egg.

264
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:36,489
Sure her.

265
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:38,386
So,

266
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:44,914
anyway, Donald is... It's very mad cap and poor donald by the end of the page in the very last panel.

267
00:29:45,553 --> 00:29:58,100
He says, well, nobody can say I didn't try to deliver it. Right. And Pour Donald is just covered in snow and very cold. So he he's console sold himself, you know, at least he gave it. He gave it a go, and So you

268
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,940
the old college charge.

269
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,760
The old male your post office try.

270
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,149
And so he resolves to do the next best thing, which is to go and tell Daisy

271
00:30:08,687 --> 00:30:11,582
about what happened. He tells daisy

272
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,178
that he had a valentine

273
00:30:13,556 --> 00:30:16,947
for her I I love how she lets him warm up.

274
00:30:18,285 --> 00:30:22,800
In the oven. Because. He's he's sitting his butt facing in in the oven.

275
00:30:23,294 --> 00:30:25,290
And he leaves out that it was Gladstone.

276
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:28,903
I don't know if he just hasn't gotten to it yet. But Daisy

277
00:30:29,282 --> 00:30:34,190
immediately turns sop. Wondering who send her a special delivery

278
00:30:35,770 --> 00:31:10,242
Again, she she barely shows up in this story that's nominally about Valentine's day. But, you know, I I'm not sure I read that exactly the same way you do. I see a little bit of suspicion in her eyes. Wondering she says Gee, I wonder who send me a Al special delivery. I feel like Donald should clue in. And maybe she was waiting for him to take credit don't know. But to to me, I'm reading her is just kind of clueless and and a bit of a prize here. But that's a that's generous reading. Mh. And then we get she's visited by another.

279
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:18,793
Group of people it turns out who have a special delivery for Daisy up. Yes. She hears the doorbell ringing and is the three nephews,

280
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,110
and

281
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:42,536
they say special delivery, and they present her with a valentine from Gladstone gander. Right. And Donald is, you know, shocked and a gas. He's asking how how in earth did they get that letter and they they tell him that they've got quite a story. Apparently, when the Nephews went to the river to practice the life saving and drowning

282
00:31:42,993 --> 00:31:44,012
resuscitation test

283
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:45,726
and

284
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:49,057
the letter, the the valentine

285
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,454
got caught on the dummy.

286
00:31:52,033 --> 00:32:06,816
And so when they pulled the dummy out of the river, the letter came with Right. And and as they're telling this to Donald, he's shu them so that he can ea drop on daisy who's telephone, glad stone to think him for the special delivery.

287
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:11,046
And there's this little, like, insult to injury bit where she hears him

288
00:32:11,384 --> 00:32:13,041
where Donald hears daisy

289
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:35,745
saying talking about how he walked clear down to the post office in this horrible storm just to mail at how you must have suffered. And Donald just has to has to leave and discussed. Well, I also have to know Daisy could have been a little class. She could have called after Al left. Yes. That's true. It didn't didn't... The phone call did not have to be made right at that moment. Absolutely

290
00:32:36,045 --> 00:32:38,625
not. And so the last page is basically

291
00:32:39,285 --> 00:32:39,785
dedicated

292
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,237
to the Du walking home

293
00:32:42,616 --> 00:32:45,992
and the Nephews are just pro on and on

294
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:47,310
about how

295
00:32:47,784 --> 00:32:51,397
now that they've passed their drowning test, not only are they high.

296
00:32:52,892 --> 00:32:59,080
But when did it... What else do they become? They became chevrolet of the on guard for making the rescue

297
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,280
during a blizzard, Right. And and they're now rear add animals of the arctic snows.

298
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:10,173
And for saving the government mail, they became common don's of the high hills hall of heroes.

299
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:14,215
And and the story closes with Donald,

300
00:33:14,694 --> 00:33:22,830
grip and g and he yells at the nephews. He says I was wondering when those found junior would chuck are going to run out of titles,

301
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:36,659
which is a great closer. It has nothing to do with Valentine's day. I enjoyed it though... But but yeah, I love it. This is something again that Don Rosa is really gonna run with an every story that he does about the junior would checks

302
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:44,134
Barks does this a few times, but this this is kinda what everyone knows about the chips. And, yeah, that that is my lucky valentine.

303
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,210
And

304
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:54,482
that's a fun one. I I I really enjoy that one, it's not like one of my all time favorites, but I think it's a pretty strong Barks story. Absolutely.

305
00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:00,679
It's it's very much in that formula of, you know, the the kind of mad cap action based

306
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:13,040
story and given a little bit of a Valentine's Day here. Check out their their high deals. Oh, they're already at the top of there. They're very very cute. You know one thing that I always

307
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:31,069
kind of think about is you know, I think it's... I don't know how common I would say, but I know that a lot of men don't really enjoy Valentine's day. And it's kind of seen as the thing for women. And, you know, so I wonder if this was kind of an effort to make Valentine's day seem a little bit more fun.

308
00:34:31,963 --> 00:34:32,702
For boys.

309
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:39,360
But again, as we've noted, there really aren't any romantic elements to right. Well, I mean, Like you said,

310
00:34:39,960 --> 00:35:02,280
valentine's in this story is only for the women. Right. They're the ones who get the the Daisy the one who gets the card, the the daisy is given to her, you know, that one's not about Valentine's day, but it's about Romance. Right. It's a spring story about Romeo. So you like this one. You prefer the second one. Little old one. I liked the jokes about the... All of the different titles.

311
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:15,555
For the junior wood checks. And, you know, I thought the panels were prettier in this one. You know, they have a little bit more detail. I like how the blizzard is represented. And some of the the little details about, you know, like, I mentioned the lamp

312
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:16,714
and Donald

313
00:35:17,093 --> 00:35:22,514
getting kind of kicked in the in the tail feathers by that one angry.

314
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,537
Right. Customer customer. Yeah. I like that that seen

315
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:32,664
that was probably my favorite page of all of them. Awesome. So let's just really quickly

316
00:35:33,163 --> 00:35:35,141
see where these stories actually

317
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:35,800
land.

318
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:38,691
We do like to check with Inducks.

319
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,986
The first story, the earliest one wild about flowers,

320
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:44,397
it gets

321
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:47,508
seven point two out of ten

322
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:52,652
and is ranked nine hundred and ninety six out of all forty

323
00:35:53,404 --> 00:35:54,862
almost forty two thousand

324
00:35:55,401 --> 00:36:05,543
Disney stories. So fairly low as far as Barks stories go. Maybe not the most memorable one, but a good example of just a generic Donald and Da

325
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:17,410
ten pager. My lucky downtime does rank a little bit higher. That one gets to seven point three out of ten and is good for five hundred and ninety ninth. Think there's a whole lot more

326
00:36:17,828 --> 00:36:19,923
to say about this one

327
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,393
about either of these other than them, you know, hopefully,

328
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:27,341
this can be your your reminder if you need to get your

329
00:36:28,012 --> 00:36:31,858
Valentine's something for Valentine's day because we'll be releasing this one

330
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:36,700
at least a week ahead of time and the run up. Any any closing thoughts

331
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:45,065
No. I I guess I would especially note that, you know, we do really enjoy our Al valentine's and we do enjoy flowers.

332
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:46,101
That.

333
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:53,780
Donald really was on the right track. Huey, needs to kick his efforts up and notch Yeah. He he's gotta show up Gladstone there. Absolutely.

334
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,839
That intended to be directed to me? Is the sub? Not even Okay. Good.

335
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:03,103
Excellent. Awesome. Well, thank you listeners
