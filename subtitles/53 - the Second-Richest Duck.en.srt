1
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,495
We can have

2
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:37,825

3
00:00:38,163 --> 00:01:04,825
publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome back to Barks remarks, I'm mark Sever, a grown man who loves duck comics, and I love to have guests on so that I can indulge myself and talk about great Carl Barks stories. I... We've got a real

4
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:11,752
day. I'm really excited about it. And I'm I'm also really excited about my returning guest

5
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,919
dan can you introduce yourself and just remind us your

6
00:01:18,257 --> 00:01:20,295
remind how you feel about these comments?

7
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:30,994
Sure. Well, first of all, it's a pleasure to be back and thank you for having back again, especially for such an important story like this one. Mh. And, yeah, I am a professional

8
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:35,424
illustrator and designer, and I've been a very big

9
00:01:35,802 --> 00:01:38,936
supporter of all the Disney comic book work

10
00:01:39,728 --> 00:01:47,851
especially in the past twenty fifteen, fifteen years where we kind of ran dry in the early two thousands and the comics

11
00:01:48,404 --> 00:01:52,860
sort of faded away when the Internet got to be very mainstream.

12
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:59,707
And similar along the way, all of the stories came back and all of them became revived got restored and

13
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:04,177
had regular comic book publishing. They had some new material

14
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:09,937
and graphics came along and established the Carl library in a very affordable format.

15
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:11,213
Yeah. That's

16
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:47,908
that is definitely worth... I I will echo that. Right? They don't they don't sponsor us or or. Thing. But but we're happy to suggest that people get the fan graphics collections. You know, it's it is hard to get a hold of Disney comics these days. They're not being printed in the states anymore. So the Carl Barks library collection, as well as those really cool Disney masters. Yeah. Collections that they put out. That's that's basically what we get now. Yeah. And actually, the nice thing is, you know, you know at the moment, status, there's gonna be two uncle Scrooge specials coming out hard cover editions

17
00:02:48,247 --> 00:03:01,355
within the next couple of weeks in November of twenty twenty two. Those of you listing in the future. Mh it's gonna be we're gonna be receiving the uncle screwed. I think it's called the diamond j, the seventy fifth anniversary edition. That's gonna have a lot of

18
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,355
reprinted Barks classics.

19
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:14,758
And then there's gonna be a bit of an omni this edition call, Donald Inducks and Uncle screwed bear. I think it's called Barks Mountain Adventures. Is that the name of it Right? Yeah. I think it might be bear mountain stories.

20
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:25,380
That's I think that's right. Yeah. With that's another large hard back collection, and that's gonna have several different orders. If stories sit on bear Mountain, which goes back to the first appearance of Scrooge Inducks.

21
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:42,948
Which is a really nice idea. Right. Yeah. It is interesting. I didn't I didn't actually realize how many artists had had their own take on on the Barks Mountain setting. I think I've only read Barks Rosa and and the the Daniel Bro story. I know I that read. Yeah. So so by all means, people should definitely

22
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,360
definitely

23
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,160
support the Fan graphics

24
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:46,960
collections.

25
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,960
It's it's great work and it's it's one of our

26
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:53,791
one of the best ways to keep Carl Barks

27
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,420
relevant at another great ways this podcast I'd I'd like think. And

28
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:22,940
and and it's so nice to have the chance to, like, actually talk about stories that I've spent so many years thinking about Dan Today, as you said, we were covering a. We get to talk about the second richest dot And this story is notable, of course, for for... Who are we? Who's joining the chat Dan? So this is the first appearance

29
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,701
of the second Richard duck Barks Glen gold he officially

30
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:29,977
makes his debut

31
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:33,625
and in maybe the most aggressive fashion possible.

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,539
You've never seen any other character really kind of match Scrooge in this way in terms of style in terms of temperament

33
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,240
and in terms of Al,

34
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:44,571
Yes. Yes.

35
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:45,488
Al

36
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:54,017
himself, if this is his very first appearance, it's kinda weird to think that it's gonna be only one of three times that he

37
00:04:54,355 --> 00:05:09,079
he appears in a Barks story. But the this is one of the last, I guess like big original characters that Barks was responsible for. You know, we're where we are now, we have not yet encountered magic could this spell.

38
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:22,618
Sure. But I guess I I'd say those are the big three. Right? Where we got... We we've had plenty of the beetle boys. Yep. Since the storm practically, they've been... They've been there. Ryan, yeah... Oh like, you say, only shows up three times,

39
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:37,654
you know, in a very memorable sense, you almost wonder if Barks didn't wanna place in the well and you go overboard with it. Because he did, you know, the funny thing about Flint card is A couple of years later, Barks had that very tall Texas cowboy

40
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:40,625
billionaire called long horn tall grass.

41
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:47,438
Remember him, there was a gag story with him, and then he showed up again in the twenty four karat moon when they were racing to the moon.

42
00:05:47,855 --> 00:06:15,345
That story you'd almost think Heart would have been a really good, you know, foil to have built a rocket try and take care of that later. Sure. I was thinking of that earlier and then I realized that should knowing knowing how Barks crafted because twenty four car, I really luck the conclusion to that story. I know you'll get to it and future episode. So I won't blow the ending for anyone. But it is... But adding flint hard into the mix there, it kinda makes a little more personal I think it would take the edge off of the

43
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:16,343
moral

44
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:25,053
conclusion of that story. Yeah. I think that's right. I think his presence almost might have distract to... Yeah. Because again, then you would... It was just would've have been another

45
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,815
competition in terms of a race or measuring of wealth.

46
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,930
However, the funny thing is now a couple years previous to this, we had the

47
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,730
of how you stand during the Right

48
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,410
one of my favorites

49
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,020
stat us. Spend threats. Right? And that was kind of the

50
00:06:42,399 --> 00:07:12,120
light template for what we're about to talk about here today. The difference being that during that match, Scrooge was never really worried. He didn't sweat it at all. Right kinda He he knew the mah only had so much. This is the first time that someone's really risen to his level and you see him like he's not really at ease with. The fact that, like, not only is this guy like kinda getting in his lane, this guy's kinda copied and his entire stick. Right. It's it's a really fun concept.

51
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:16,840
So so we got kinda two things in one here, Dan. Right? We got two,

52
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:53,340
I guess, classic, like, tropes or story archetypes. That that really resonate. We got the competition story. That... That's the thing that's the thing about Flint hart, but that's what he's notable for in these couple of stories, that Barks uses him in. It's it's the these money face off. These money competitions. That's kind of his whole real reason for exist. And then this is also a do game or story. A trip people are really interested by the idea of of the do or the person, you know, your exact matt somewhere. Yeah. The the broken mirror version of yourself or

53
00:07:53,799 --> 00:08:17,345
get the protagonist in this case. The funny thing is, you know, I... I was looking this a yesterday. This pre dates Vis bizarre Superman, which I didn't realize. Oh, that's a good a good reference to point out. Yeah. Yeah. Because, like, they... You know, Dc did... And they the were reverse slash. They had a couple things of that nature. This three dates Bizarre by, like, two years, even the what was it Mirror mirror episode Star trek again know, the Evil version.

54
00:08:18,262 --> 00:08:25,929
Think he evil go spa. This one... Yeah. This would definitely pre day that. Right? Y. Yeah. By this... By by a identity Barks.

55
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:29,102
Mh. And the funny thing is if you look at their appearance,

56
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,616
now, you know, Long has sorted of this

57
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:35,139
crooked, probably, you know, like a like, a you know, like, a weather

58
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:40,375
piece of wood as a cane screwed just that kind of, you know, gil age sort of

59
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:54,870
monopoly man sort of straight cane, which really contrast their personality alone. And Glen is at actually a little bit more of a smart dresser he has sort of an Es. He has, like, a nice black blazer. He does where the the tam

60
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:14,845
However, he is after by origin. And the interesting thing I found is that even his bill is sharper. His bill is very similar to glad stones at least by way of Barks. Mh. Where Scrooge is sort of that rounded donald and his glass the frames of his glasses are darker. It's that again, that contrasting thing where he's

61
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:47,459
he's... Like you say he's sort of that evil Do version where Scrooge screw just has the whisk but Glen has the full beard. Alright. So... I'm gonna go off on just a little bit of a ramp here. Yeah. Because, you know, you said that and and it's it's at and he's the evil do or he's like he's like the wario to to Mario or thing. Right? But but really, he here's something that I'd like us to pay attention to as we go through the story, I think you you see that come up a lot in in comments

62
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:59,753
writings and in books about, you know, Barks or on the Internet that people won't know that he is he is basically the evil version of Scrooge. And that is true, right, except it's only true

63
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:04,461
retrospectively. If you look at him across his three Barks appearances,

64
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:22,614
and what other creators went on Yes. To to do. Because, like, if you actually take a look at this story and isolation as though we're reading it when it first comes out, and it's the only story we have to go by Guam. He is really not coded

65
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:23,934
as evil

66
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:28,054
or as a bad guy in this one. He really truly is.

67
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:33,667
Scrooge just like mirror image in this one, and and there are moments where it'll be a little bit crafty

68
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:36,703
and and a little bit under handed, But

69
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:52,294
Bark is very pointed to to give Scrooge these, like hangs of ambition where he's a little bit more ruthless, than he would normally be So that I'd like to pay attention to that because I think I think at least the is this original

70
00:10:52,713 --> 00:10:57,857
incarnation here. He's really not that bad of a guy, he's not noticeably

71
00:10:58,433 --> 00:10:59,332
more evil,

72
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:01,126
more,

73
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,369
Scrooge screwed himself it. You're

74
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,324
really that's absolutely

75
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:39,928
apt perception because he's... They're really on equal footing. The only difference is that, you know, Gru has the home ground advantage because Alright. In Africa Scrooge jazz the benefit of his family helping him out. Yeah. So... That definitely does. That definitely is going to soften him. Right? He's got he's got his family around to help him out and maybe raining his is a little. I don't mean to be all like justice for Glam gold or anything. People are it's accurate to think of him as that sounds like a hash tag. Yeah

76
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:47,871
But but when you when you just look at this one in isolation, I think the reason that the reason that this story works

77
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:57,510
so well. And and I'm I'm gonna lay it out right here. I love this story. This is a tight great later Scrooge adventure. This one works

78
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:07,613
So well, I think the reason that it works up so incredibly well is that they are these mirror images. It it it is so fascinating to see Scrooge

79
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:08,551
meat

80
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:10,027
himself, basically,

81
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:13,817
and and see see some of the discomfort register.

82
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:40,620
On him, even if he doesn't quite understand what's happening. Absolutely I so... And this... Like you said, the evolution, like, let's we can talk about other incarnation after, but Yeah. The evolution of the three stories Barks did, you don't see Flint card become morally bankrupt until somewhere in the next story. Right. Then he turns by the third story. He's Al flat out. He's absolutely the scam draw. Yeah. He's vis he would and he was out to kill basically.

83
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:47,632
Right. But like, you said here, it's, you know, you you kinda see this at the... This is the spark that got the

84
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:52,317
going but, like you said, it he's not... Yeah. He doesn't want anything. It's

85
00:12:52,775 --> 00:13:13,204
this is a matter of pride. And this is a matter of their, you know, their own personal title. Right. So an excellent pro log excellent pre dan, let's talk a little bit about the story itself and it's creation So we are into the later half of the fifties now. We're in the the covered date of this story is July of nineteen

86
00:13:13,582 --> 00:13:18,087
fifty six. And we're in Uncle Scrooge, number fifteen.

87
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:22,935
And you and I were talking, and I noted that this one has quite a few reprint.

88
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:28,697
It makes sense, you know, it's an iconic villain, and I a fairly iconic character.

89
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:39,869
It's had fourteen fourteen printing and including the original in the United States. Okay. And it's a it's it's a fairly short adventure story. It's a twenty pager But

90
00:13:40,248 --> 00:14:05,537
I I think it's really tight. I don't I don't think it suffers from being too short or anything like that. No. I would... You know, I'll tell you. I wouldn't have mind it another two pages of just more, you know, string bun yeah. Throughout the throughout the Savannah. But it's it's really... It's compact, and it also doesn't... It takes its time when it needs to within those twenty pages, which is nice. Right. And one thing I wanna just point out is

91
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:09,720
I wanna just remind the listeners that prior to the comics

92
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:39,085
career. Barks was a gag man at the Walt Disney Studio. He was a... What is really a story board artist now. And when you're devi things for the screen especially in the mid to late thirties, there's a lot of visual gigs. There's one in here in particular that only someone in animation would have devised, and it Barks so beautifully, I will I will point it out when we get to it. But Yeah I think I I have a feeling I know it's when you're talking about. But yeah But we'll put a pen in that I'll see. Let's

93
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:44,605
see. I was gonna sit... Hey, what do you think if we did the, like, old

94
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:50,094
family feud thing and asked a hundred people to list Carl Barks characters.

95
00:14:50,592 --> 00:15:09,100
Right? Characters that Barks his most famous for. Where do you think Flint heart would be on that list? I mean right with it... It's got any uncle Scrooge. Mh. Is isn't number one. Mh Right. Probably g Gear list number two? I would think so. After that, you would pick off the wood trucks count. Yeah. That

96
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:18,015
gonna... Right. Right. You know? But I think Magic is right under them. I was thinking the beagle boys might might be the the first villain on...

97
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:52,296
I mean, they do It's hard. It's it is hard. Because I you know what if you gave people like a key of, you know, fifty characters and instead are alright here are fifty characters, which do you know Right. That, you know, It's hard. But, yeah, I I feel like he would... I mean, he's definitely in the top ten, but he may be number five. Yeah. I was thinking he'd be somewhere around, like, five, six seven. He... He has such an interesting space to me. I'm really fascinated by the fact that Barks just used in those three times. He feels he he oc has much more of, like he he has a way

98
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:54,705
space in the sort of Disney comics.

99
00:15:56,236 --> 00:16:07,800
Sphere. Yeah. That lot of my a lot of people pardon the upon Al on to and a lot of people really used him. At Bike car really used him a lot as I recall. Mh. From the from the from the

100
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:40,271
Burgess, the reprint during the glad. I know there's a lot of There's a lot of and brother used them quite a bit too. There was a couple of really good ones to used to for. Yeah. You. Practically name a a Disney comics artist and there's a great chance that they use Long more times than Barks. Yeah. I... The only person like I'm trying to think I don't think Sc but used him very much. I think he was more with them Rock duck at all. Right. Yeah. The Italians loved love them some some John rocker docs. But, yeah, It was it was more... I think one of the scandinavian

101
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:44,106
countries that really, like, really lean into long.

102
00:16:44,539 --> 00:17:09,121
But and... But again, they had a good... The the... The nice thing for them to have the only the three stories they could kinda take it into different directions they could kinda flush them out it which because you got you got different different iterations of him. He's he's kind of a different character. In each of the three stories. Yep Alright. You know, the only little bit of trivia that I think I'll mention right now is that that there is this weird brief little illusion

103
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:20,455
to the second rich stuck in the world in an earlier ten pager, like, totally unrelated to this one. There's it's in... It's in the story turkey with all the scheming,

104
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,273
which I've been thinking about putting out as Christmas

105
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:25,605
episodes. Oh, is that the

106
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:27,002
the

107
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,271
baloney. Yes. Yes. Who Donald poses as is is mentioned.

108
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:55,091
As being the second richest stuck in the world. And specifically Inducks, right, not the man, but I think we're we're to understand that when Scrooge says the I'm the reach stuck in the world. He is... He is counting himself as the richest quote human. That's always been my reading. I really I also really like the title for this one. You know, I I like that it's it's unclear

109
00:17:55,668 --> 00:18:00,234
until you get to the end who it's actually referring to. Mh. And

110
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:05,670
Yeah. I think I think I'm ready to go into our little international segments.

111
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:06,166
Sure.

112
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:17,972
Because this... I... I'm excited for this dan. I love to to my international listeners. You know, this this podcast is as much for the Western Europeans, the scandinavians

113
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:31,102
and and whoever else around the world is listening to me ramble about ducks in English. I say I think they love it as much as we do collectively even more So... Yes. Yes. They they love their Inducks,

114
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:48,893
and and they keep these stories alive. So so what I like to do is I like to run through what some of the titles from around the world are. But but in this one I was thinking to myself Huey, Long has such a cookie key and fun name. Right flint heart Guam. That's part of the That's part of the genius of the character.

115
00:18:49,429 --> 00:19:13,645
That it it evo hard harden flint part. And then Guam gold is like money grabbing. So he's up upright. He's a hard hard money grab. So... And also, you know what funny is it? A Barks used Guam, a lot. He used as sound defect. Somebody was passing by and grabbed something on the way Guam was always a part of the caption. I always enjoyed that. It's a great word. It's it's one of a handful

116
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:33,555
of a number of words that I have in My vocabulary and mentally think about solely because of the Barks. Yeah. No. He because you know what he does inform our a vocabulary and often are kind of conscious thoughts. And. Yes something I mentioned you earlier was there was a dick... There's an Al to Dick Tracy during the earlier

117
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:45,875
Chester Gold newspaper strips. His name was Vitamin Flint heart. He was kind of a middle aged desk being very air died. But he always took a up very contemporary now. He could took a lot of supplements

118
00:19:46,295 --> 00:20:04,434
vitamins, and that was well before this, this is fifty six. I think he appeared in early relief the early forties. Barks was a pretty avid reader of newspaper comic strip especially the serial immunizations. I'm guessing that's where Flint heart came from Unless those dime novel from earlier in his youth

119
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:33,365
when he was a, you know, when he was a young younger guy. Yeah. It seems as likely to me as anything. I mean, he's he's had fifty some years of being an avid reader of National Geographic and serial economics. So of course, it would bleed in. Alright. So I am going to mention a couple of the titles from around the world. And then Daniel and I can kinda take our hand at some of the iterations of Blonde gold name. So let's see. I really enjoy the one from

120
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:34,405
Netherlands

121
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:37,165
where the story is called D

122
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:41,380
Von Huey,, which is the tango of greed

123
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:55,015
And stretch. Yeah. It is. I I guess, I it must refer to the the string getting it tangled up. A couple of these stories will just end up being basically Scrooge versus Guam gold. Mh.

124
00:20:55,855 --> 00:21:00,406
So hold off on those. I liked Italy. Italy, we've got

125
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:04,561
in the monetary

126
00:21:04,874 --> 00:21:05,374
tournament.

127
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,681
And then Norway is ph and colon.

128
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:14,220
Scrooge gets a competitor. Oh all highlights lights. Spain which was just called Los

129
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,280
Y.

130
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,860
The two the same. It must be some kind of like,

131
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:30,506
or expression or something. Yeah. It sounds like an independent film. Know right? Alright. So so the real the real bit that I'm excited about. Let's let's go over a couple of the character names.

132
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:35,635
What do you got dan? So in Germany, long gold name translates

133
00:21:35,935 --> 00:21:37,355
to Matte money.

134
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:39,415
And that that is his name.

135
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:46,284
Not money stock. Yeah. That's awesome. I really like in a couple of the scan

136
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:48,995
countries they're they're pretty similar.

137
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:50,209
It is.

138
00:21:52,974 --> 00:22:13,085
So it sounds still like flint Barks. But I gather that gold his gold and he Eva evo is is a name, but it's sounds kinda like hard hearted or something like that. If you know the line... Old hard. Yeah. Right. And then how about Italy? So Italy, his name is Cor,

139
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:14,625
Sum,

140
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:20,679
and we had looked Al up a few moments ago. And did we say it was basically old heart.

141
00:22:21,137 --> 00:22:22,555
Right. It was like

142
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:33,381
Was gold hot Golden Hunger, Barks stone. We're guessing. It's like stone hearted money grab. Right. Wow. Yeah. Which is great. And France,

143
00:22:33,877 --> 00:22:49,437
so screws is named p sue. Right? Mh. Am I pronouncing that right? I think Yep. That's I believe that's that's... Because I know Ducktales and france is likely bundy peace. Right. So they call him peaks to and and they went with a I name for Long. He's

144
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:56,432
grape you. So the story was called Pete sue called the Groups you. And he's called A

145
00:22:57,047 --> 00:23:00,895
Grip zoo. And and I like that. Yeah. And I gather that

146
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:01,705
grape

147
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:12,300
I think it might... So sue, I think is like a word for coin. Right like old French. Right? So greek maybe be grab. Right. Yeah. I think I think so.

148
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:22,898
What else do that? This is your Facebook. Your your Facebook list just have to chime in and give us their if anyone from from any of those respective countries, should really give us like the, you know, the breakdown

149
00:23:23,355 --> 00:23:48,697
Right and let us know if we're close completely off days. Right. Because, like, we can translate it, but but sometimes, you know, there's there's a little flavor of that translation that we just. Aren't gonna know. And I'm sure there's one. To this too. Just like On. I can't imagine that's translated anywhere else in the world. Yeah. If for for international listeners, if you don't know, the word Guam, It does mean to grab something, but it's basically

150
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:50,012
unused

151
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,095
in English. Right? It's it's it

152
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:55,572
a very, like, frantic

153
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,408
guess matching something snatch.

154
00:23:58,907 --> 00:24:00,740
Exactly. Let's see. There was

155
00:24:01,238 --> 00:24:02,256
Brazilian Portuguese

156
00:24:02,673 --> 00:24:03,572
was a

157
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:09,033
Mac money. So they're kinda going with, like, a Scottish name there. I? And

158
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:11,005
did I mention

159
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:12,725
dead

160
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:15,845
in in Dutch, he's called Gov

161
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:17,400
good Gladstone.

162
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,500
And I just didn't have the chance to look that one I that... Yeah. And they're going with the

163
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,620
there.

164
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,074
So anyway, lot of fun. He's a mouthful.

165
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,328
He's a pain in the butt in any language.

166
00:24:29,764 --> 00:24:40,990
So let's let's do it. Let's dive into this story itself. So dan, the second richest dot I I... This this story is so great. It's got a really great opening

167
00:24:41,384 --> 00:24:56,710
It it's the rare Scrooge story where we start out outside of the money Bin. Screws is just out and enjoying the day. And he encounters his nephew Donald Duck on his way somewhere in a hurry, and he warm costs him asking

168
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:08,816
Donald where he's off to and Donald tells him that he's he's on his way downtown. He's gonna get a tall cool gooey ice cream soda. And this is this leads into...

169
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:34,970
I think this is the first time we really get this dynamic. I mean, it was kind of introduced in only a plural man. Right where Scrooge is like lobbying donald to his kind of lifestyle. But but this is this is kind of the icon difference. Between Donald and Screws. Right? Scrooge is gonna do this thing where he tries to convince Donald not to waste his money on, like, f volley.

170
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:36,965
And it's a very

171
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:37,885
philosophical

172
00:25:38,185 --> 00:25:46,340
thing. Right? Because Scrooge is like he's trying to convince him you're gonna get so much more satisfaction if you save your money.

173
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,420
And Donald

174
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,620
he... He's clearly content with the idea of

175
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:55,363
spending his few coins on a few nice world pleasures.

176
00:25:56,001 --> 00:26:07,020
We we get some really good dialogue and some great great poses some awesome pain jab from Scrooge as he badger and button the holes donald telling him

177
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:07,820
telling

178
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:21,317
dan every every bit of dialogue here on this opening page, every exchange between Scrooge and donald is so great. He yes. Him why. Why? So does cost money. Think it nephew.

179
00:26:21,774 --> 00:26:34,056
Donald says I did and I still wanna soda. And and it goes on to say you should never put your stomach out of your personal boy. Invest that two bit and it'll will become fifty cents at compound interest. Donald

180
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:40,204
goes to say, I know I know and but dollars aren't eat like ice cream sodas.

181
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:43,720
This is classic call and response comedy team.

182
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:46,665
Level every it's, you know, one state

183
00:26:47,121 --> 00:27:00,211
you automatically have a snappy answer for. Yeah. It's it's very fast. It's a great bit of dialogue. It's why I'm tempted to read this whole darn page, which is something that I almost never do. Now how many... I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna read this last panel here.

184
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:16,662
He says, I'm a ashamed of you, Donald. You're a wasteful and a spam lift to donald. I'll just create gives this great shrub I know, but it's the only way I can get sodas. I love it. That... I don't think there's been a single page that has ever kind of delineate

185
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,337
the the difference

186
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:19,990
between Scrooge and Donald.

187
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:31,856
As it really... It really works well. Because it just it down, it's it's entertaining, but you get the exact idea of which if never read any of these before. This breaks everyone down perfectly.

188
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:45,565
I also like the fact that, you know, we're we're in nineteen fifty six. Even only a portal man for it's this this really cemented because now we're in the air like alright. There more Tvs easy and homes, everyone has more leisure your time, everyone has a little more extra money.

189
00:27:46,099 --> 00:28:01,530
And Scrooge just from that industrial era and from the, you know, from the error of need from the error of being scrappy and frugal. And Donald is just at this point in life where it's like no. There are simple pleasures and I'm there for them, I wanna watch Tv. I want to drink a nice

190
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:15,284
soda I wanna go to a ball game and I wanna lay in a hammock. Yeah. That is that beautiful contrast that that shows here in in... And digit, but it's just it's done in such an entertaining way. And like you said, the Cain jab I think there's...

191
00:28:15,622 --> 00:28:26,010
Just Severino I think they're three out of five panels just regain, which is great. Right. So we we transitioned to the next page, and they're basically

192
00:28:26,524 --> 00:28:34,121
almost casually, if not accidentally wondering towards the bin, and there's... Yet another call in response and this next panel

193
00:28:34,498 --> 00:28:40,002
screwed pulls out his first time. It's not the first time we've seen it. Nor it'd be the last

194
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:45,010
there's a lot of Barks referencing his own stories.

195
00:28:45,504 --> 00:28:54,695
Within this story, which did not happen terribly often. He yeah. Really references a lot of the stuff he's done in the past the dine being one of those devices.

196
00:28:55,229 --> 00:29:07,875
As well as they're heading up towards the bin, which is on in this in the case of this story, It's on Kill hill still. It's not as steep as it often is but the port carlos is there as they enter the bin, and you can see,

197
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:12,988
Donald is just basically being yank into another economics lesson. Mh.

198
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:20,655
And Scrooge takes me to the bin and even though Donald seen it before. There's this lovely panoramic panel and Scrooge just

199
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:29,956
Spread arm says there you see. This has made me the richest stuck in the world, owner of three cubic acres of money, un accountable oil well gold mines or railroads,

200
00:29:30,674 --> 00:29:31,174
factories,

201
00:29:31,512 --> 00:29:34,063
and fish houses. And, of course, Donald Has to.

202
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:38,285
And I bet you've never enjoyed a soda in your life

203
00:29:39,023 --> 00:30:03,868
because that younger generation is always gonna sas and sure enough screwed just get out On wasting my time with you. You have no appreciation for the finer things in life. And as he kinda scoot his nephew out, they passed by a giant ball of string. Yeah. The the signaling on this story, the the the fore foreshadowing on this page is really great. Right? Because it's it's done with a lot of care

204
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:18,145
more care than more care than Al have done and some of his stories. Right? Because again, it's very natural the way he points out that first time and Donald points out oh you sure do have it. It's tied to you with a string even.

205
00:30:18,565 --> 00:30:44,988
So, you know, Barks is boxes is telling us right away, he's signaling that... He even has Scrooge mentioned. I saved string too in case you can imagine anyone being that thrifty So we get these, like, three references to the strings saving on this second page. It's great setup. I didn't see a lot dan about, you know, Barks thoughts on this story, but but I did see in or was it. That was in the infant graphics.

206
00:30:45,645 --> 00:30:53,580
The commentary mentions that Bark had said, he had the string idea early on because he had remembers

207
00:30:53,917 --> 00:31:11,944
years before saving tin foil and string used to be quite a thing. Doesn't say so directly there, but I'm I'm imagining that must be referring to the depression. Yeah... Well, you you gotta think the depression and also growing up in a very rural area. You know, these parents were

208
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:23,805
really pioneer people. So, you know, even if New York and Chicago were in a gil age that were they were in the Pacific Northwest, like they probably had a general store, and that was it. And they were probably.

209
00:31:24,661 --> 00:31:35,950
Trading with farmers and local. So if they got something tied up with string, I'm sure they saved it. I imagine the Barks family would have been right conservative. And and that's what the quote goes on to say. You said, we always

210
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:48,737
string around the house. We didn't have Scotch tape so we use string for holding things together. Some people carried it to the point of seeing how big a ball string they could accumulate. Oh, and apparently, that was quoted in the

211
00:31:49,170 --> 00:32:25,029
celeste arts. His life and Times book for me. Yeah. Okay. That's... Yeah. That's right that would have been in there if that makes good sense. So it... It's interesting to think about Barks kinda chewing over this idea, You know, of of taking it from there. And if you think of how, you know, how the country was at, you know, the first twenty, you know, the first twenty years of the twentieth century, there had to be a lot of people doing exactly that. That had to be fairly common. It was probably really relatable too just coming, you know, ten years after the end of World war two or eleven years after the end of of World war too, where there was a lot of that rash. Going on.

212
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:30,743
So onto the third page, this sequence is all about Scrooge

213
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:32,881
stew and his

214
00:32:33,634 --> 00:32:57,186
His relationship with newspapers, we see this a lot where Scrooge is unwilling to buy a newspaper. He walks through town, fuming that he's the richest Inducks in the world and just knowing that makes up for all the tall cool busy sodas that I've missed while getting that way. And that's gonna be an important point. Right? That's gonna be a lot of the justification for what happens down the

215
00:32:57,525 --> 00:33:04,500
into the story. And so he passes a newspaper boy, you know, classic something that's a great time capsule thing.

216
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:13,975
And he tells him to take it away, he never buys his newspapers since they cost ten cents. This is one of those many references to him getting his papers

217
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:15,428
in the parks.

218
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:18,658
And when he finds a recent one,

219
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:20,213
this a great line.

220
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:35,452
I love this Dan. He says, here's one that's only two days old. That's better than the one I found yesterday, which was full of news about the nineteen o six birth quick. And and here is where he learns the detail that sets the whole story into motion. The

221
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:40,882
headline, the the story and the paper reads Flint heart Guam, the fabulous

222
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:45,882
South African Line owner is now the richest Inducks in the world. And

223
00:33:46,219 --> 00:33:50,627
knocked out. Yeah. Oh, man, Dan, what do you think about about these panels?

224
00:33:51,300 --> 00:34:06,679
Where where he's just days and and and just dead to. The head. Yep. Yep. The head spinning in he's slow over. I, you know, his his hat is actually, like, dangling off his foot. He's absolutely... He's got the sweats. Like this is... You you rarely see him this

225
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:20,095
shook. Yeah. Something. And it gets this this is this is the first time that someone's actually like in its kitchen. Right. Right. Someone's just really gotten into his head because it's in the papers it must be true.

226
00:34:21,028 --> 00:34:36,297
He goes on to read his discovery of a vein of Pure gold and his newest mine has pushed his fortune past with one multiple Al nine of squad Al Barks. So this this is another mark in my occasional series where we take note of Scrooge just like

227
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,143
where Barks will actually

228
00:34:39,681 --> 00:35:12,546
describe his net worth with with totally changing figures. Boy, I'm reading a lot, but there's a lot of great dialogue here this is gonna be... This is Al line that's gonna get echo look. He thinks to himself in a days. That ups start that Johnny come completely. He can't do this to me. And as we, you know, as we close this stage, it's screws just... He's walking off of the ten yard stairs. He's he's not doing. Right? And we get to the next page. He is just kinda like he's he's sort of just rejected. He's sniff into a hank of in a way we've really never seen before.

229
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:29,868
Life won't be worth living now that I've lost the money championship and. If I have and he kinda runs with a little bit more courage back to the Bin because he hasn't checked up on his own fortune about a week, and you see his very exhausted clerk in a sea take tape Scrooge dashes,

230
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:49,410
Clerk Clerk, what is the latest daughter of my wealth berkeley replies. Fantastic sir, completely fantastic I have it right here. And again, you can only see us clerk from the chest up because the took tape is just that. It is just the c. Oh, the total value of all your minds mills, money vincent and so forth is one multiple jillian

231
00:35:49,786 --> 00:35:51,260
nine of sq v.

232
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:53,293
Sp,

233
00:35:54,232 --> 00:35:58,008
six hundred and twenty three dollars and sixty two cents which

234
00:35:58,347 --> 00:36:03,160
turns the tables completely this is now on over the abs quid... Oh of boy.

235
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:12,675
Obstacle quick million mark. I'm not a second class millionaire yet, and that's a lovely victory pose. That's a real it's

236
00:36:13,015 --> 00:36:13,635
fluid fluidity

237
00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:32,900
but I love and this this kind this just sleep in the air. Oh, yeah. But with, you know, with that... That's very much Al Don test kind of opposed right there. He could he really stretches the du out, and I really love to see see them really brought to their extremes like that. Yeah. I I would really encourage people to take a look at each of Scrooge

238
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,600
expressions on this...

239
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:47,362
What are we on? Just the fourth page here? Yeah. But and and he has some page, we we he basically you ran a gamut of a emotion. Actually, this whole page, he's running every emotion possible. Oh, yeah. That going further ahead.

240
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,450
Because. And yeah. That you you read it. That is

241
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:57,395
you know, the previous one was Guam gold net worth. But I noticed in this one that it ends on

242
00:36:58,013 --> 00:37:00,364
with sixty two cents. It's usually

243
00:37:00,943 --> 00:37:05,897
sixteen cents. Yeah. Which I think sixty just a funny number. Right. Barks

244
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:14,203
obviously does to house. So no. This might be the only time he references it. I don't I don't know. It's certainly the first that the clerk mentions

245
00:37:14,822 --> 00:37:18,215
the value of all your minds, mills, money bin.

246
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:21,915
He says money bin plural. And that's one of those things where, like,

247
00:37:22,755 --> 00:37:33,131
fans and other artist have kinda speculated. Well, you know, that bin is is not... Probably couldn't account for as whole fortune That's been one of those things where people have

248
00:37:33,845 --> 00:38:34,068
supposed in some stories that, you know, this is just his main bin with his nostalgic money. Right. Yeah. This is like his photo album. Right. The interesting little aside. Because I think there have been some people have used like, they downtown. They reserved bins and things like that. So... Yeah. And that's that's kind of an... Again, there's you know, there's never gonna be a definitive anything, but you can kinda... You know, I always take these things to face value. Damn I love the end of the page where he he says he's gonna match him mine oh, it's it's great rioting. Do you wanna read that panel? But well, yeah, he he basically, he points to him map on the wall and he decides to have a show down with Bernard Gone gold and your your caf I'll match in mind from mind mill for million and dime for dime until we know exactly which one of us is the richard Inducks and slammed is fist on the desk with the sack money and the coins go like, with the word exactly, that's what they that's where fifth meets the... Yeah. Yeah. Did per base of the desk It's a really great one. And then again, just going back to the running every possible gamut of emotions,

249
00:38:34,447 --> 00:38:47,425
then you just see him kinda lean slumped back in his office chair, and he's just exhausted because he did indeed run every gamut of a emotion, and he asked the clerk to book passage for his nephews because they'll need them to carry him home if he loses.

250
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:49,545
Right. And the very idea

251
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:55,749
him Well great build that So we transition with all of the Inducks

252
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:56,865
heading to Africa.

253
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,417
We're gonna take a ship And

254
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:05,205
this sequence is very cool. This one has Scrooge

255
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:28,862
This this is where we see that it's a passage for the Ducktales hand the ball of string. And and Scrooge is talking about taking along the list of everything that he owns to to be able to match against Guam gold. And when an nephew queries why he's bringing the ball of string, he says, this is the only way he can keep saving things while he's on board. He goes to

256
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,110
to point out a piece of string that he can wind onto to his ball.

257
00:39:33,764 --> 00:39:54,202
This is a great little Gladstone stick bit where the string just keeps whining and winding. It ends up being a very long piece of string. And one of the nephews rounds the quarter. To see where it's coming from. Any yelp run for for life on bridge. You're unwinding some other string Severino ball of string.

258
00:39:54,619 --> 00:40:06,000
And to and we see... I mean, I'm gonna describe him with the energy that the story presents him. Right? We see an older duck with mu chops, pension nes, spectacle,

259
00:40:07,514 --> 00:40:13,827
What would how did you describe that hat? I think that's a Tam. A ham. Yeah. You're right. Al Tam S. Is that what it's called? Mh.

260
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,220
A ham hat

261
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:28,121
He's an older duck He seems to be, you know, and combo lasting a little bit under a quilt and he looks up a gas to see this ball of string. So he's not named. This is obviously

262
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,118
flint heart guam gold, even even an

263
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:31,997
sophisticated

264
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:35,127
reader even a child reader probably...

265
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:42,170
I think there's a good chance that they're gonna pick up on that. Right? Yeah. But I think it's been telegraph pretty pretty easily. And has.

266
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:48,008
Right, the Ducktales do not know it, but but we're signal because we never encounter Inducks

267
00:40:48,127 --> 00:40:52,155
that look like Scrooge. This the first time we've been presented with this.

268
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:57,332
It's great. It's it's inn, but it's this nice little

269
00:40:57,709 --> 00:41:13,757
kind of almost wink wink nudge nudge. For foreshadowing, I think. But but you know, it's it's also entirely possible that the reader didn't see it coming. Too because Barks does put some odd ball characters out sometimes in in his stories. That just background.

270
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:29,825
That's true. That's through because even... Yeah, about even the... You know, even the news boy. On the previous stage, he was pretty well designed, you know, for something as as a one off, you know, inn thing. Right. It could be... It could be a throw way. Yep. But we get to the next page now the

271
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:57,318
The other passenger with the ball string is not having it, and he's basically kicking chasing Scrooge up and exhaust pipe on deck and it is... And the this... The moment these two go face to face, it is just... It isn't... It's our they're already clashing. They don't even realized they they're the ones who were coming after afterwards. It's the inverse of the the h shield. I I love... Loved you before I met you Right? They they hate each other before they manage each up.

272
00:41:58,195 --> 00:42:11,545
So Donald just Barks that when lot of string local Scrooge won't save. Is one of the nephews supplies. It's some character, but that's our Scrooge And finally, it causes Huey, to kinda lean against one of the cabin and say, yep, that's our uncle Scrooge.

273
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,359
I wonder what S Al gold is like.

274
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,779
And some days later, the Ducktales learned in the valley of the Limp

275
00:42:19,174 --> 00:42:27,645
they have a rented car and they're pulling up to a very familiar looking structure of a money pin almost identical. Just Scrooge.

276
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:34,999
And is it... Now is that a pound, the dollar sign is Al a pound, or is that a random do you think? Yeah. That's a pound sign.

277
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:37,374
Yeah. That's the pound. Right? Because

278
00:42:38,112 --> 00:42:44,832
this was this was part of the British empire. Where where is the limp po? Do you know? So really, we're looking at

279
00:42:45,568 --> 00:42:45,888
South

280
00:42:46,406 --> 00:42:59,001
Africa. The River runs Southeast Africa. This is also not far from... Or not terribly far from Kimberly, which is the largest diamond in mining area in the world. Right. And that is...

281
00:42:59,816 --> 00:43:03,997
I think that's one of the reasons Barks chose to make K African

282
00:43:04,335 --> 00:43:08,506
was the connection with Diamonds If there wasn't a nefarious

283
00:43:09,323 --> 00:43:28,254
context to it, I know even At this time, there was a lot... What they call blood diamonds or conflict diamonds that were smuggled out and the profits of which were used to funds civil wars. I'm guessing that might have inspired Barks to set it in Africa for that very reason beyond the diamonds and also just to get them out into the

284
00:43:28,714 --> 00:43:31,534
Savannah. Yeah. I mentioned there's a lot of fortunes

285
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:50,574
that were made. I think I think Barks just has a little bit of a fast an issue two with South Africa, you know, he loves to reference the borrower war canon and. Yep. That's right. That's right. Yeah we're gonna that right here in the moment. Right. I I knew that it was South Africa. I didn't know exactly where. I just looked it up just so people know. It is in the northeastern

286
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:59,911
part of so out Africa. As you say in okay Yes. But but you're right. It's it's in the south. It's it's... Well I guess to be in the southeastern part of yeah.

287
00:44:00,884 --> 00:44:05,664
Funds in it. And it's just on the border of boats botswana. Mh. And it's

288
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:24,917
it's... You know, and again, you You go back to nineteen fifty six. You had to think it was even more un contained at parts. Right. So if you if you... There's some sub too. Right? Like it Barks, this is never a thing in the story, but I guess it's unavoidable that like Flint heart is definitely coded as, like, quote.

289
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:28,726
Right. So so he's definitely part of the

290
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:29,605
minority

291
00:44:30,064 --> 00:44:32,641
population. Mh. In South Africa

292
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:42,005
that is that that would go on later. That would go on to perpetuate a part. Not I'm not I'm not calling I'm not calling flint hearts.

293
00:44:42,937 --> 00:44:53,823
Out in that respect. It's just that that is like, that is the energy. Right? That It would have been, like, a land owner he would've have... He would have been an... A big big time exploit

294
00:44:54,162 --> 00:45:02,904
in this... Of of the workforce. And again, he he... He would have been more likely to have maybe participated in some illegal sales

295
00:45:03,282 --> 00:45:21,013
smuggling or mining operations. Right. You know, we never get there, but you could see that that might be within his character. Mh. And and I think if we think if we open ourselves up to thinking about the other two stories, that's definitely a fair sub position. Right. But you see that again, the similarities are

296
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:29,071
cycling right down to the port palace. Now the funny thing you just mentioned, Donald says Well no doubt he's copied a lot of your ideas,

297
00:45:29,511 --> 00:46:37,900
and the moment he knocks in the door the or war canon pops through. Now the funny thing here is Number one, we didn't see the Canon in this story at Scrooge office, but we've seen it several times before in previous stories. Right? And the really interesting thing here is what I'd said earlier, this is kind of Barks power in the self, which I really think is a remarkable turn here. Because for someone who didn't really, you know, go with hard continuity of his own work, this is enjoyable as it is. With a cold read. If you've read the earlier Barks work, this is twice as funny. Oh, yeah. It's it's totally additive. Right? And and you feel like Barks is is kinda taking... He's basking a little bit. He's taking a bit of a victory lap here in this really cool character mythology that he's built up. Absolutely. This guy maybe doesn't admire Scrooge, but he sure aware of who he is and what about. Or or so Scrooge thanks. And in my head, he really genuinely does know about him. And and this is all happened stands. That's that's my take on it. That's possible. Too. So on the next page, we transition it the the whole time Scrooge is sn

298
00:46:38,437 --> 00:46:49,963
about, you know, what a cheap skate this guy is, and how he's copying him. And he announces him itself is having sent a cable saying that you'd arrived and who he is. And we get this fun little bit where

299
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:55,203
Gold Barks, Did you send the cable c o d and Scrooge of course,

300
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:10,065
did because he'd never paid for cables that he send, and long gold likewise would never pay it for cables that he gets. So he didn't know he was coming. What is that acronym there dan? That should be care of delivery. Care of delivery. Okay. Alright. And that's the essentially the

301
00:47:10,604 --> 00:47:22,664
equivalent of a collect call, I'm guessing. That's right. Right. Okay. So we got this great illusion where he he lets Scrooge and he says, oh, I... I've read about Huey, Inducks and papers found in the park.

302
00:47:23,243 --> 00:47:31,816
Scrooge says in So rotated Donald. This tight law doesn't even buy new newspapers. Can you... Can you beat that? I I love that

303
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:38,766
lack of awareness. That's it's very funny. It's that little hand to the side that kinda breaks mirroring.

304
00:47:39,342 --> 00:47:47,113
And so once he gets in, we we are gonna get the reveal. We don't see long until he emerges from a money bathtub

305
00:47:47,729 --> 00:47:48,229
another,

306
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:49,066
another

307
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:56,525
and Scrooge is shocked to see that your Barks long, the old crank I met coming over,

308
00:47:57,164 --> 00:48:04,623
and Donald observe the two richest Inducks in the world and they're sword each other already. And and this here begins

309
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:11,980
one of the great sequences the Barks is ever done. It's the money argument sequence. Dan. I love it.

310
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:27,057
Each of the ty cones is gonna go on to show off and brag about and just list what they have Guam gold shows and I... It might as well be screwed just money been. It looks exactly identical and

311
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:38,542
he has a crane in there and kinda steam shovel and his, I think. I love Scrooge just response you cats this guy is a scandalous old money.

312
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:40,277
It's so great.

313
00:48:41,235 --> 00:48:58,848
Go ahead run run through more of the money argument. And now there's you see and again, those teeth those teeth are buried once again, he says, I'm no tall or myself Columbia go, I have three cubic acres and money in my money ben and Glen little shade, can add much is that in pounds and shi

314
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:15,092
Scrooge screws pulls out of. Very comic long piece of paper with the figures. Mh. And said I can't stay off him, but I've got figures right here on this paper. And En discussed on a paper that's small and they just start comparing, you know, the bottom four feet of my money been full of diamonds.

315
00:49:15,471 --> 00:49:22,013
I'm not impressed the bottom for feet of my bin is as star chef fires. Then it gets aggressive.

316
00:49:24,025 --> 00:49:24,105
Yes.

317
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:30,045
Because at the they they just they start wiping up in the air renting then they actually...

318
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:37,005
Then it becomes physical, and it's very funny. It's... It... This is very pope. Damn the sequences

319
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:50,255
so funny to me. We we gotta treat this whole thing as one sequence here. Here's what we should do. We we need to we just need to acknowledge that the docks are gonna go through this argument. I was gonna say it slowly,

320
00:49:50,675 --> 00:49:52,575
but it really doesn't. It immediately

321
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:55,747
escalate into an An outright

322
00:49:56,363 --> 00:50:03,803
of fist fight... They're p each other as they compare figures. And and I think we just need to

323
00:50:04,354 --> 00:50:10,033
talk about some of our favorite You know what we need to do, dan. Yeah. We need to read this

324
00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:16,760
verbatim. Okay. With one of us is Scrooge and one of us is long. Sure. We want wanna get to that...

325
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:37,974
Tell me where you wanna start. Here's where we're gonna start. And and the reason is because we're we're gonna start with the the list. Mh. Where he he shows off the the figures on the paper. And that's because that's gonna be the very first instance where it turns out to be the same. And you know what? You're the guest I will let you be screws if you would like.

326
00:50:38,313 --> 00:50:39,172
Alright. So

327
00:50:39,511 --> 00:50:50,048
who's just, you know, Scrooge kinda pops up to... I'm gonna pop or myself gone old I have three cubic acres of money in my money then. And he Al and asks how much is that in pounds and shi?

328
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:55,513
I can't say off offhand, but I've got the figures right here on this paper. On a paper that small.

329
00:50:56,392 --> 00:51:02,320
You seem to have about the same amount of cash Al I have. Quite a showing for the second which Inducks.

330
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:10,201
You'd better not call me that until you can prove it. Of course, you don't know that the bottom four feet of my money bin is full of diamonds.

331
00:51:10,575 --> 00:51:13,904
I'm not last the bottom four feet of my bin

332
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,259
star sapphire.

333
00:51:15,715 --> 00:51:18,088
I've also got ten tons of.

334
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:35,567
I've got twelve tons too. Long tons short. I've got one thousand and two oil wells. I've got one thousand and two two went two digging. I also own farms. I've got six hundred acres of bump. Never mind the acres. How many pumpkins?

335
00:51:37,441 --> 00:51:38,741
And and eventually,

336
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:40,461
eventually

337
00:51:40,921 --> 00:51:47,590
donald and the other docks have... They have to jump in and and rest strain them from hu each other.

338
00:51:48,368 --> 00:51:50,626
And and they decide this as

339
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:53,212
and they decide this as Scrooge

340
00:51:53,929 --> 00:52:05,585
stump on guam. Like he's stopping on him. Saying I'll match you Very for berry any kind of blue goose hu grand straw, black rest, logan or Juniper. And eventually,

341
00:52:05,965 --> 00:52:13,800
the the other Inducks resort to tying them up picking a soft sack of money and just letting them hash it out all night

342
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,880
overnight. And eventually,

343
00:52:16,395 --> 00:52:21,563
Donald approaches them in the morning and asks them what is the score now

344
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,287
and Scrooge tells him it's even all even

345
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:34,602
except for one thing, we can't decide who has saved the biggest ball of strength. And what a perfect

346
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:41,621
to this face off? Because not only did we go from the most valuable

347
00:52:41,998 --> 00:52:44,911
possible assets now we're down to the most ridiculous

348
00:52:45,291 --> 00:53:07,005
min of their own frugal Al. It's it's wonderful. This is such a great high concept. Right? The idea of these guys being so evenly matched that this is what they have to do. It's totally ridiculous. Right? Because we know the way money works that these guys are literally they're they're at the whim of the stock market is changing the value of their fortune.

349
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:16,580
Alright. One of their pumpkin fields is certainly just like taken, you know, a hoard of locust but but deep down, there's this like there's this

350
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:43,095
universal idea that these guys are basically evenly matched. And it's just it's just the truth because it is. Yeah. And it's again, it's it's this isn't this isn't about how much it's the point of pride as to who owns the title. You know, it's almost like room wrestling in a way. Actually, that whole f that whole argument that's very reminiscent pro looking in away. That's it's it's a very violent. It's it's Al hilariously.

351
00:53:43,592 --> 00:53:44,810
Violent match.

352
00:53:45,307 --> 00:53:49,136
And when do you think about that it's, like, between a couple of eighty something or whatever.

353
00:53:49,669 --> 00:53:50,386
Old man.

354
00:53:50,864 --> 00:53:52,059
It's it's wonderful.

355
00:53:52,457 --> 00:53:53,993
Alright. So tell us

356
00:53:54,330 --> 00:54:22,057
tell us about the beginning of the sequence And so Donald does absolutely be welder heat just for Remarks. You mean to say those goofy Barks as string are worth h over of course, they were do get and out all night. Miss spring seems to be the last piece of the puzzle. So naturally Scrooge has his string ball brought over from the hotel, and you could see the two of them the measuring cape trying to kinda just get a general gauge. They look equal. They seem to be the same circumference

357
00:54:22,569 --> 00:54:30,532
So Scrooge determines the... We'll have to take these Barks to the open country and un them and they rolled the balls out from the entrance

358
00:54:30,925 --> 00:54:37,658
of Long gold been out through the heart of Africa. And they're, we have this crazy challenge

359
00:54:37,997 --> 00:54:46,151
about to take place and you can see parts is playing. Barks plays a lot with shadows in this ins silhouette in particular in the story.

360
00:54:46,645 --> 00:55:03,372
But there's a really... The the fourth... Sorry, The the fifth pack... The fourth panel has them kinda just overlooking the horizon with the balls of string. It's it's kinda cinematic. And it's a really nice setup up to what we're about to... And you can see the the twisted Ban trees, the branches

361
00:55:03,685 --> 00:55:11,296
and the trunk in the foreground. There's a lot of nice... There's lot nice little just suggestions that we're not in Ducktales here that we are kind of been wild country.

362
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:44,949
And enrolling them across the African valve Scrooge says yes the only fairway to enroll them in a straight line. Donald just march you've gone wacky uncle Scrooge that be right through the heart of Africa and screws Relentless says you bet, there'll be no arguments about cutting corners. Is that okay with you Glen and Guam gold is... Now you see this shifting kind of, you know, ref glen gold come to the service and he agrees. And he said I was about to suggest that same course myself. And now you see that dd kind of

363
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,497
you know, that you could see those wheels turning at the end of this stage.

364
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:56,644
Right. And and he definitely looks devious there. But like in fairness to him, again, he's he's really letting

365
00:55:57,263 --> 00:56:23,311
letting Scrooge take some bait here. There's there's nothing at this point unethical about what he's doing. I would say you know, it they they both theoretically have the same chance here, but he he just knows the area. I love this c when stand, the the the story transitions from the that one great sequence of matching portions to to this other one And and this is great. This is such a unusual

366
00:56:24,007 --> 00:56:24,507
bonkers

367
00:56:24,844 --> 00:56:25,344
weird

368
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,855
concepts, but it's so imaginative

369
00:56:28,232 --> 00:56:33,096
and that as you say that Vista looking through, you know, what promises to be the heart of Africa.

370
00:56:33,913 --> 00:56:56,046
I would say this is gotta be in the contention for for one is screwed for one of Barks best africa for stories For one thing it has much less baggage than most of them do. But it just feels very imaginative. And it really feels like the the part of Africa that we're in. It... And, you know, the the first two pages of being out out in front of the heart of Africa

371
00:56:56,481 --> 00:57:23,064
the... There's no real outside of the mountains. There's no real indication that there's not... You know, there's no animals, but you you see the wide open. You see that it's kind of un unchanged Yeah. We definitely get the idea this is gonna be hard. So the next page, you know, this this is really devoted to the start of the race. Others there's a nice moment where Donald despair that it wasn't bad enough that there was one millionaire in the world as Wacky as uncle Scrooge, their has to be two. And the

372
00:57:23,403 --> 00:57:29,396
look at that one responded nephew went bed. Yeah. The really like oh, this again Right.

373
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:32,428
And and that really kinda hammers home, the whole

374
00:57:33,047 --> 00:57:50,410
idea. And and so the two string rollers set off with with Donald Fetching about how silly this comp competition is. And the docs point out that the two ends, you might you might spend days enrolling it and still come out even. They could they say that the the Inducks could match to a brilliant of an inch.

375
00:57:50,749 --> 00:57:57,536
And here's where we see Scrooge being graph you know, he says he wanted to get into rough country for things that could happen

376
00:57:58,034 --> 00:57:59,510
where things could happen to Al

377
00:58:00,348 --> 00:58:01,345
precious string.

378
00:58:02,023 --> 00:58:12,676
And he points out there are are five of the docks to protect his string, but Flynn heart is alone, of course, we transition a Flynn heart who's have it... Having his own crafty ideas ideas about

379
00:58:13,572 --> 00:58:26,241
you know, he knows the lay of the land. And so he very effectively kinda hints Al the rest of the story. He he schemes way till we get to the ant country and Thorn Ramble, Africa will take care of Al Scrooge

380
00:58:26,721 --> 00:58:26,921
string.

381
00:58:27,576 --> 00:58:29,716
I like that the two docs already have these

382
00:58:30,016 --> 00:59:17,849
nickname for each heather. Yeah. There it's there... It's this kind of less angry effect, if you will. The interesting thing about this page, like, from the first panel to the last, they've probably gone about fifteen feet. They've only taken high and full of steps but we've really gotten into everybody's head and look at the blast two panels look at the parallel between their poses, and they're kinda there with the way their minds are working. It's really like These guys really are cut from the same cloth. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Now we kinda move a little bit further into the day and the fact of matter is that, you know, the having five of the Inducks versus one glen gold is beneficial because they can all take turn rolling the ball. And everyone else can kinda go at a better pace. Scrooge just just kinda he's just dancing along. He has a great little pose in that first page. Yeah. But they are...

383
00:59:18,386 --> 00:59:25,122
Everyone's getting worn out already. Finally, they get camp and glen being the only one rolling his ball string is absolutely

384
00:59:25,459 --> 00:59:31,874
wiped out. So he's kinda, you know, just collapsed on top of his ball. Scrooge in a possibly

385
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:37,534
generous gesture offers him a cup of coffee and Glen gold is very gracious.

386
00:59:38,045 --> 00:59:54,451
In accepting it and offers screws a tip to protect his string from Removing animals. He points over to the cone of Clay. He just put your ball up on that. And it'll be safe from fan or clock. Again, they're very very very coral Barks right there. Nice and enterprise.

387
00:59:54,951 --> 00:59:56,945
And Scrooge is Genuinely,

388
00:59:57,323 --> 01:00:28,328
you know appreciative. Thank you, Flu, and he and Donald h the ball up on the cone of clay. You use a little suspicion you know, I never dreamed you would do anybody a favor either uncle Scrooge and uncle Scrooge kinda slightly looks at his nephew it says, I have disappointed you that coffee I gave was loaded with sleeping pattern. We can already see that the logs are being sold off panel. Coupon gold is collapsed again on top ball string because Scrooge was suspicious that maybe he might sneak back and rewind his

389
01:00:28,706 --> 01:00:39,478
string wall the other Ducktales slept. So he kind of uses it as preventative measure. And one of the Nephew says well, if you were figuring doing some of for your own rewind wall hard

390
01:00:39,991 --> 01:00:41,091
you better get busy

391
01:00:41,511 --> 01:01:01,337
because the ball that Scrooge Donald h up onto to that Kona Clay was a giant handheld hill. And the ants are absolutely knowing away. What would you say? That's about half of the diameter of the ball? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Correct. That's that's about right. It's it's it's being devoured. It's it's pretty active. You know. This is... This is very much in Indiana Jones style.

392
01:01:01,714 --> 01:01:31,997
Yeah. Kind of a trick. And Donald Scrooge are kinda like trying to brush the ants off with their jackets Which nice about that last panel is the... There ins silhouette against the shadow... I guess I think it would be the shadow in the Al, and the net user are fully drawn in the foreground But they kinda have to... They have to kinda laughing remark that old came up best in the first exchange of favors. I I like how Barks is kinda outlining it. You know, it's almost breaking the fourth wall. Right we're gonna get... We're gonna Al three segments here where

393
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:33,276
the environment

394
01:01:33,854 --> 01:01:40,726
as flint said, Africa is gonna whittle him down to size It feels very, like, real. You know, it feels very visceral.

395
01:01:41,226 --> 01:01:42,466
This is a great sequence.

396
01:01:43,226 --> 01:01:57,139
The only notable thing I'd say we've got we got screws drug flint hard. It's not a great look, but No. No. It's even sleeping powder. You have to wonder how how well circulated this story will be in future years.

397
01:01:57,737 --> 01:02:03,361
I went... And that was Al that was a pretty common cartoon convention, but Yeah. By

398
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:16,207
too. I'm sure. Right. So that... That's our first after sequence. Our our neck one is gonna be the thorn bra sequence as fl is kind of mold over in his head and, you know,

399
01:02:17,179 --> 01:02:24,454
We transition immediately to the next morning where Glam gold has had a great night sleep courtesy of the sleeping powder and

400
01:02:24,966 --> 01:02:43,458
Scrooge is fuming about being out smart the previous night. And and long jive, you know, you should give up because it's plane that I have the most string But the whole premise of this, the fantastic premise to this story is that you don't know how much string there is until it's been rolled out. Okay

401
01:02:43,836 --> 01:02:50,371
And so all of the Inducks get ready to to take off when heart leaves first she rolling is

402
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:56,105
string. As as they kind all over that will be ready for any tricks.

403
01:02:56,864 --> 01:03:04,032
One of the nephews used comments that their Ce picture is m see, kind of an interesting spelling of syrup there. I don't usually see that Al

404
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:16,715
really a Uk or a Canadian Yeah. Looks like to me. But but none of them made all the Syrup and and they note that there are a lot of ants coming from all directions.

405
01:03:18,146 --> 01:03:34,481
Because of course, Guam gold has poured the entire picture of Syrup on his ball of strain and tanya. This is a great line. Yep, Dan. Donald says he ants walk to you again. That's the line out we remember from this story. I I love it. And

406
01:03:35,295 --> 01:03:43,787
and Scrooge, you know, he has to, like, use a stick to push the ball somewhere safe where he can try and deal with this catastrophe.

407
01:03:44,899 --> 01:03:49,967
And Guam gold very helpful points to a river over in one direction.

408
01:03:50,686 --> 01:04:06,423
And this ends that being a great bit of reverse. Psychology. Right? Because Scrooge is this is a very kid friendly demonstration of that concept. Scrooge is not gonna listen. He's not gonna trust him But as he pushes the ball over what he thinks is a bank, it ends up being a pre,

409
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:09,213
full of thorn bra.

410
01:04:10,284 --> 01:04:18,778
And glenn... You know, Glen gold gl that he he did try to tell him of course, predictably, he knew that he would not listen.

411
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:30,036
And we we transition but this ball is getting whittled down pretty fast. Isn't it dan. Yeah. You might be right. It it might have been nice to see, like, two to four more pages

412
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:31,314
of ball.

413
01:04:31,772 --> 01:04:34,667
Yeah. Nothing not gonna call it ball shrinking at

414
01:04:34,981 --> 01:04:35,481
but

415
01:04:36,699 --> 01:04:39,915
No erosion. That's good word. Oh, yes. String,

416
01:04:41,013 --> 01:04:41,513
radius

417
01:04:41,852 --> 01:04:54,337
shrinking, anything anything to avoid being on record saying ball shrinking. But, yeah. Just give just little, you know, on both sides, it would have been kinda fun. But Yeah. I mean like minor it's a minor

418
01:04:54,836 --> 01:04:58,532
picked. It does it does transition quickly, but it's naturally

419
01:04:59,006 --> 01:05:25,061
Scrooge has sent his poor grand nephews to recover it and they obviously look worse for the wear and they say that they un all the string they could reach, but there is basically a normal sized ball of stream The could your two hands left. And Guam gold is gl mildly saying that Africa has whittled you down your proper size and your double sure the second richest Inducks.

420
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:31,696
And screws is really fuming at the end he's kinda. Now he's, you know, he's basically holding that it's not even the size of volleyball this point. Yeah.

421
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:40,036
Alright. But they they have to go back, you know, set up camp again. And in the midst of the night, one of the nephews here's

422
01:05:40,789 --> 01:05:49,491
strange noise. You said, what is that roar off to the north? It's not thunder, we'd see lightning. Screwed Barks up and says it says medicine saying it's coming closer.

423
01:05:49,945 --> 01:06:17,151
And I'm gold. Does gold realize it... Like oh, no. No. No. Oh, I'm sorry. En said I'm scared. I wish I had a safe place to slash my ball string. Because his ball string is still, you know, it's it's it's practically the size it was when they took off the bandwidth with. Scrooge on the other hand can fit his Al of string right into his top hat, the nephews reply that it's becoming a chewing sound like a buzzing be of a billion wings. And it turns out to be a gigantic

424
01:06:17,811 --> 01:06:18,671
a absolute

425
01:06:19,371 --> 01:06:20,791
Frantic form of the locust.

426
01:06:21,091 --> 01:06:29,143
And if you go to that last panel, plum gold has his jacket off now and he's beating them off of his ball of string. A very

427
01:06:29,799 --> 01:06:30,299
electric

428
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:32,549
lively panel with these.

429
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:57,384
It's maybe one of the most. It this this is a very marble comics es panel. Right here. It's very action packed. Right? You know? And in the meantime, he's just frantically trying to save this string both. Screw other and just has a simple fly water. And he's clothing that. I can't help you fl. I got my hands keeping them for meeting my hat and it's funny because the previous panel with glen beating is

430
01:06:57,723 --> 01:07:04,951
beating his string bowl. It looks so... It looks just... It it looks like an absolute nightmare. And screw just sitting and you're very calmly with Al fly sw like

431
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:13,701
and there It's nothing. But Barks really like again, like, a lot of the Barks backgrounds have been fairly simple until we got to the thorn ramble.

432
01:07:14,076 --> 01:07:18,956
And until we got to the locust, Africa has been pretty spa. Yeah. It's true.

433
01:07:19,755 --> 01:07:21,995
And it's it's about to get a lot busier.

434
01:07:22,356 --> 01:07:39,396
Right. That the the low sequence, it's it's almost not over. Right? Because it seems like everything is passed and and long gold is is disappearing that they ate at least fifteen hundred miles of his string it's pretty comic because it still dwarf.

435
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:46,285
Screws. But, you know, I guess this gives Scrooge a little bit of hope. And Scrooge points out he's still got a lot of

436
01:07:46,876 --> 01:07:50,255
coming to you. And now the do see this really ominous

437
01:07:50,796 --> 01:07:51,935
chain of fires

438
01:07:52,316 --> 01:07:53,675
to the south and west.

439
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:57,206
This is a really interesting part Dan. Right? Because

440
01:07:57,925 --> 01:08:25,466
Gets this look of error on his face as he recognizes what going on. This version of Guam gold is not going to he's not gonna choose to leave the doc for dead, he yelp that it's grass fires, the natives, uses native are burning the valve to stop the locust Sm tells them to run for their lives. Yep. And and the Ducktales are confused because there's no grass to burn nearby, but he explains.

441
01:08:25,841 --> 01:08:31,940
Just just very truthfully and, honestly, that the danger isn't fires, it's animals, There's gonna be a stampede

442
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:40,019
past in the next few minutes. So everyone should climb the strongest tree that they can. And and sure enough, we get

443
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:44,780
one of the... Definitely one of the stand out panels, right of the story.

444
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:53,335
I was obsessed with, like, african animals at this age dan. Yeah. And I just... I loved this panel depicting all of these

445
01:08:54,394 --> 01:09:00,567
Savannah. Mostly Savannah type animals stamped heating past the docks in in beautiful

446
01:09:00,946 --> 01:09:02,379
silhouette. In the tree.

447
01:09:02,877 --> 01:09:18,500
Screws gets off a funny line, which kind of soften the danger here a bit by saying, I'll be a dog on sitting duck. Those guys would step on you. And it is a real... It... You know, it... This is a real who's who of African animals. And home again, you know, Severino

448
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:18,960
area

449
01:09:19,337 --> 01:09:27,392
anatomical, you know they're still cartoon, but they're very anatomical well represented. We have even at Hip running, which is kinda funny way. Right.

450
01:09:28,204 --> 01:09:29,263
Beeping cells.

451
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:56,909
But, yes, so they are rushing by. And like you said, Glen kinda like explained to them like, you know, in a way of, like, almost for reciprocal compassion, you know, they're all trade but Scrooge at this point sees there's kind of a vulnerability with Al gold kind of nestled on that out or limb. So he just tries to swing himself around jiggle branch so that the string ball would drop, but do we kind of rep man's says don't you there that's cheating. Scrooge just still bit more,

452
01:09:57,330 --> 01:10:02,985
you know, he he's he kinda... He's he's resisting temptation. He says doug got it. This is for title. Yeah.

453
01:10:03,985 --> 01:10:13,100
Before you get to that this very animated sequence coming up here, Dan, this. This is the this is a really notable little mini seat right because this is one of the most

454
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:13,980
scanned.

455
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:23,472
That Scrooge is gonna act in this story. Maybe not in any story, but Mh. But this is a low point for Scrooge where he starts to cheat and he's

456
01:10:23,851 --> 01:10:32,230
restrained by his family. And and that this this panel is part of why I feel sympathetic for Al because this is like nothing worse.

457
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:57,952
L heart didn't do anything worse than what screwed starts to do here. Right Yeah. Again, they're really uneven. They're on and even ke in terms of their own moral you know, their own moral standing. You have to say that. And that's the funny thing. It's just that you you... You know, the the whole thing was drives sharpen than the sharpie tough than tough each smarter than spa any major your money square. This isn't square dealing here. Right. If you look at it. And that's... This is a little un en

458
01:10:58,409 --> 01:11:06,424
the guy we are the the Ducktales know. But but it does feel even if even if Barks isn't explicitly thinking this, it it feels like

459
01:11:06,842 --> 01:11:08,054
the Ducktales

460
01:11:07,974 --> 01:11:11,215
his his nephews are, like, outsourced his conscious.

461
01:11:11,775 --> 01:11:25,481
His conference a little bit. Right. And he he does pull back, but... But it was there. So this is the sequence I was talking about earlier where I think Barks the animation story board artist Gag man really comes into play as the rhino.

462
01:11:26,074 --> 01:11:31,524
Rams into the tree out of the panic, the string bowl that Glen gold was holding

463
01:11:31,942 --> 01:11:39,877
falls goes around the neck of... I... What I think would be a crane and the ball in falls directly onto the horn of the rhino,

464
01:11:40,532 --> 01:12:36,825
the bird keeps flying, pulling the string and the boss of string unwind, and to you have to see it to understand it, but this is something that would have been in any animated short, this would have been such a terrific gag, and I would tell you any other artist would probably just had the ball fall and the rhino and the rhino and what it kept running. This is five times funnier. Oh, yeah. If not twenty times linear. It's is great. You're right, and it feels very animated. And sometimes I'll criticize some of the sequences that I see where Barks you know, is is clearly trying to do a cartoon style gag because they don't always work in in the medium of of paper and panels. But this one works phenomenally. He stages it like beautifully. It's gorge... And the other nice thing is going back to what you're saying is this is such a fun little bit of ira irony and comedy that counters the kind of the the darker motive Scrooge screws just three panels yeah. Yeah. Definitely

465
01:12:37,365 --> 01:12:43,280
deflate that a little bit. There's a nice balance to this page. And and flint heart, to sparingly

466
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,860
this says that happens is pretty great him hanging down from that tree.

467
01:12:48,860 --> 01:13:06,475
And and so Scrooge on the next page where we're approaching the end here, Scrooge thinks that he's maybe gonna get the upper hand, but it turns out that a bird flying past has clipped on a small little bird has gotten its foot tangled in his string, which was sticking out of his hat a little bit and has

468
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:29,057
likewise wound away a lot of it. Scrooge is only able to recover. What looks like about a golf ball worth of string. So Barks is really... He's he's only got a couple pages here to work with. He's really accelerating the to its end. And We transition to hours later where Glam gold recovers his ball And and they both have been made into

469
01:13:29,394 --> 01:13:30,652
string pop.

470
01:13:31,068 --> 01:13:37,187
We get this awesome panel where they hold out there string balls and the palms of their hands,

471
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:47,205
glaring at them side by side, donald commenting that you guys are even once again Africa little you both down the size. And Barks

472
01:13:47,383 --> 01:14:12,499
is gonna wrap up this last part with a narrator box that says the great show of wealth and string is finally decided on a strip no longer than a picnic table and they've stake them out in the ground from their starting point the Nephews are watching on and they're commenting that they can't come out even on this test. Because after all that's happened to that string, it would be in possible.

473
01:14:12,837 --> 01:14:19,441
And this is such a wonderful panel where you fit everybody into the frame and you see these two

474
01:14:20,153 --> 01:14:34,745
unbelievably wealthy men like children with marble, rolling their tiny ball string down to the last voice. But. But they're cautiously watching. They're not watching their own they're watching each other. Almost like just waiting for the the moment of

475
01:14:35,323 --> 01:14:46,179
waiting for the moment of discussion or cheating on the other guy's part. And and your marble comment is right on because this is just so childish of them. It is. It's it... This one's from ridiculous to absolutely

476
01:14:46,560 --> 01:15:48,155
absurd, but it's such a... It's... There's so much balance to this panel I absolutely adore it. Oh, yeah. And take us home, dan. Yeah. Well, guess what, they do come out even. Donald this donald on one and he he has a ruler, and he says you guys must have been going to be equals and all things and en is just lost it finally since I can't stand it this isn't right. I can't be. It can't be now. I am no longer the richest stuck in the world Scrooge just stands up he says you never were yet Jon come lately because telegraph what we that was telegraph early on in the story that you pointed out I'm still as always, the one and only, they're just stuck in the world I have proof right here in my pocket. The string tied to his number one dime adds more than enough length to his own string to make in the champ. And Pro has the classic comic book. X over the eyes and just has to do the do do the faint. Right. We get a nice pratt. Mh. And, of course, this is Barks so we have to tie it nicely to the

477
01:15:48,655 --> 01:16:04,600
initial opening scene and screws just explain to donald. You see what choice saving can bring to a person the power what satisfaction what sterling victories and for that, again call response. Donald just says maybe so and Scrooge, but I'll still take a tall cool soda.

478
01:16:05,054 --> 01:16:08,032
And as they're on the foreground, nephews are helping a rather

479
01:16:08,371 --> 01:16:11,768
rejected guam gold back on his feet, heading towards the money Bin.

480
01:16:12,487 --> 01:16:28,935
Dan, this this last page is it's like perfect. It is. Either so much to love about it from from the predictable fact that, yes, they the string measured exactly the same down to we assume a sq of an inch. And then the pacing

481
01:16:29,315 --> 01:16:34,383
where Barks really draws out Scrooge is revealed. You can see him taking

482
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:38,549
satisfaction in it. And and he did such a good job of, like,

483
01:16:39,546 --> 01:16:53,166
signal and introducing that Scrooge. But he he still did it in a subtle enough way that you're not like, I don't know about you, but I distinctly remember the first time I read it. I was not waiting for that moment. I was not

484
01:16:53,622 --> 01:16:56,235
anticipating it. It came as a delightful

485
01:16:56,771 --> 01:17:08,824
surprise. To me. So to me, he struck the exact right balance of... Oh, yeah. I totally remember that. And again, it's not something that was introduced for this story that had been present previously

486
01:17:09,203 --> 01:17:15,250
because did the callbacks in this story really. Like, this is one of those things where everything just converge so nicely.

487
01:17:16,169 --> 01:17:16,669
Really

488
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:19,525
especially the past, let's say the pest fourteen issues.

489
01:17:19,978 --> 01:17:31,699
Right. Right. You know, where where a lot of these books didn't go in that direction where continuity was not really Things were not touched upon from a previous book. Right. Right. And and as you say it's it's book

490
01:17:32,197 --> 01:17:37,086
so nicely with with the continuation of Scrooge and donald

491
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,340
conversation, and that last panel is so lovely

492
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:47,994
with that mix of silhouette. You you called it the the panels where he does the silhouette and the full drawing.

493
01:17:48,734 --> 01:18:24,714
They they... They're lovely. They really seem to evo the long shadows in the air developed. It's really notable too how warm the Nephews how kind of the nephews are being with Al gold. You know, they really seem like they've had the six experience together. They they're they're kinda nicely inclined. It's it's... It would feel out of character later. Yeah. It would. But, you know, here too, it's like they... You know, Okay. Not only did they have to go through the initial conflict, but, you know, they were camping out There had to be conversation. They had to have my connection with him. They at least have this big experience together. It's it's easy to imagine the relationship

494
01:18:25,054 --> 01:18:30,087
between sp and Glen gold going a different way after this. And then being like, rivals,

495
01:18:30,425 --> 01:18:31,563
but not as

496
01:18:31,902 --> 01:18:40,885
opposition as they will be. But if but, you know, barb, that's not where Barks wants to go. No. And I I do seem to remember at one point reading that

497
01:18:41,344 --> 01:19:01,378
something that I couldn't find this time about Barks use of Guam just said, he just didn't feel the need to use them anymore, but because he just didn't have anywhere else to go with him. But I really think that's a shame. When you think about all the times he just used generic pig faced villain, you know, mix wine or or whoever.

498
01:19:01,757 --> 01:19:15,973
Long is much more interesting. Huey, yes. And that's you're right. And I... Again, I I feel like he just he... I think he kind of respected this character to bring him back enough but maybe he didn't want to make him that regular...

499
01:19:16,311 --> 01:19:43,243
You know, just that that regular guide because that might have, like, taken the... That might have taken the vi out of them. It it is kind of it is kinda odd that he didn't lean on him as much as Magic would will come in about two years from the point of this story. I think was four years. Right I know he used her, like, six times seven times, but yeah. Like something around there. Yeah. But I guess when you have a sources that isn't necessarily all powerful or competent. There's more story potential there than

500
01:19:43,662 --> 01:19:46,959
right. She's the only real, like, magic element

501
01:19:47,393 --> 01:19:56,609
that that he's gonna use that much of even if she's not really magic, but she's definitely... She's definitely a fascinating name character. So I understand what you wanted

502
01:19:57,306 --> 01:19:58,382
He also probably...

503
01:19:58,979 --> 01:20:26,528
Well, there's a lot to say about Man. Yeah. No. There is Al lot fun. Yeah. That's all that you're gonna have you gonna have a lot of people coming for that. I'm sure. U. But, you know, funny thing is with the next story we see long, this the money trap. Right? That's the title of it. It's like Yeah. The the confrontation when they meet here is funny. When you get to the money champ, that confrontation is twice as fast and twice as funny and twice as violent. Yeah. It's so neat to see him, like,

504
01:20:27,486 --> 01:20:49,415
really have Scrooge get get physical. Yeah. It's hilarious when you stop and think about what elderly territory is supposed to be. So so, Dan, I loved going through this one. Does this was this has been a blast to summarize I have not I think that I've made pretty clear how I feel about this story. I think it works

505
01:20:49,951 --> 01:20:50,451
spectacularly

506
01:20:50,829 --> 01:21:02,345
well. And and I just... I love this one. If this one flows so beautifully and just everything... You know, like certain films are that way where Severino same transitions

507
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:13,977
so perfectly. There's not a jump every... It's it seamless you don't even realize you're going from one sequence to one to another this one is one of those stories that just... It just... It it's like silk. It absolutely...

508
01:21:14,475 --> 01:21:33,725
It absolutely just brings you right along to the next scene with that any bumps or jumps or anything. Right. So, Dan, we talk... We'll we always check in for how the community feels about a given story. I know you and I big fans of this one, obvious this is like a second tier story for me. It's it's right

509
01:21:34,143 --> 01:21:35,500
outside the all time plastics.

510
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:38,334
As far as voters on Inducks,

511
01:21:38,669 --> 01:21:40,169
the the big Disney comics

512
01:21:40,549 --> 01:21:55,049
website where people can can chime in and and rank stories This one has a very strong sport. It's got an eight point one out of ten which is good right now for number twenty four out of all, like, forty two thousand or whatever

513
01:21:55,668 --> 01:22:07,313
Disney comics. So, you know, the the the community, it's it's not too surprising. Right? This is Sc first appearance so that that in and of itself is gonna cause people to vote this one very highly.

514
01:22:08,031 --> 01:22:29,155
But I think that this story really holds up much like Gladstone first to appearance, you know, people loved that, but it also happened to be a great great story. It it's the same deal here. I guess this the same thing for the B boy's kara Boys is another all time class So the these characters got introduced in some truly great stories. Yeah. That was not accidental.

515
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:38,183
I I would have to say. There's just... There's there's certain ways to ring bring a new character to bring a new concepts into the fold. And oftentimes,

516
01:22:38,563 --> 01:22:49,099
that's the thing that the the way you launch them really like the memorable or makes them not. Because some things just never returned. Right. So we also like to talk about kind of appearances

517
01:22:49,516 --> 01:22:50,592
in other media.

518
01:22:51,509 --> 01:23:00,863
Boy. That that's a huge can worms. Right? Flint heart mom gold is is gonna go on. He's never gonna be like the biggest Disney character ever. But he's a recognizable

519
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:11,413
iconic character who's certainly used outside of the Barks stories we had mentioned before many other Disney comics creators have you used him. He's he's appeared.

520
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:18,193
Even outside the Disney comics he's definitely appeared in both of the runs of Ducktales.

521
01:23:18,807 --> 01:23:26,087
Yep. Al little different in that... I think the a Barks side aspect, especially in the eighties, I think that's what kind of might of

522
01:23:26,424 --> 01:23:27,602
spur them to make him

523
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:28,418
scottish.

524
01:23:28,952 --> 01:23:35,593
That's more point. I know more especially in nineteen eighty seven, you know, that's that really made a more of a black mirror version of Scrooge.

525
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:39,704
Right. Right. Yeah. So it's weird. I always thought it's weird that he's

526
01:23:40,043 --> 01:24:01,862
relocated to Duck and he's a scottish duck Inducks, but you're absolutely right. That makes sense. Couldn't have probably gotten away with having him because I I think it would have been insensitive. You know? Especially not that. Because if things Barks so volatile at that time. Right. And then he's just... He is such a deeply ridiculous character in the newest run of Ducktales I will admit to

527
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:33,720
finding him pretty entertaining and and amusing from time to time. But but on the whole, that version of the care tray. As I'm amusing as he can be, it just kinda rubs me the wrong way. I... Well, look again, coming from this is your origin point, it's such a far stretch. But within the absurd of the twenty seventeen show, it's funny that this guy is such a desperate wanna be. Right. There there is some comedy to that. That, like, again, I kinda see past all of it. There there really is. The the episode that where he gets amnesia is probably

528
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:38,209
in in... Among my favorite from that show. That gets dark.

529
01:24:38,826 --> 01:24:50,887
Yes. That one sounds dark. And they give him... Boy they get... I think they give him a name. And, oh, they call him Duke below. Yeah. That's right. And that way callback to the store? That was a weird,

530
01:24:51,521 --> 01:25:16,234
weird Al little callback. But he and and they they did have him originally from Africa from South Africa. Right. As as a as a kid, which was kind of kind of round breaking too. Right. It's... Again, like, there... There's a lot of layers to that. But, yeah. Like, his his overall goal was, like, No. No. No. I... If you don't you chance, I'm gonna try and be just like this guy. But I'm gonna be more Scottish than him. Right you're mori rich him. And and

531
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:20,384
that that was also, I guess, partially taken from the Don Rosa

532
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:22,917
story, right? From the life and times. Yes.

533
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:39,197
Because Rosa did do... He he it ends up being one of those, like, that the trip were you and counter your villain in your past and you don't even know it, but Scrooge doesn't encounter Gold without even realizing it in the After set.

534
01:25:40,172 --> 01:25:46,092
Chapter of life and times. Right. And that was originally gonna be in the son of the southern, the first of story. Yeah.

535
01:25:47,212 --> 01:26:04,482
Space for it, which is kind of interesting too. But but, you know, Rosa was... Rosa was the one that really took Glen gold back to the Barks level and then he he again, he made long to threat. Where did not. Right. And, and he used him pretty, pretty quickly in his own span of stories.

536
01:26:05,135 --> 01:26:10,183
As as the bad guy and a few of those early run ones, including this very first

537
01:26:10,561 --> 01:26:30,532
Fine. Which I love that one. Boy, you know, we've we've we've mentioned a lot of great panels. Are there any that you would like to kind of really go to bat four that we didn't that we didn't, like, spend too much. Give too much attention to as for a favorite panel? Tell you the one I really I mean, the, you know, the locust...

538
01:26:30,872 --> 01:26:53,104
The locust detects silhouette, the... Even the thorn Bra is a really beautiful one, but I think those are the obvious ones. What I was looking at before, when I just reset to the first page here, that opening panel is so nice where you just have poses of donald Scrooge screws. They're kind of in encountering each other. But Look it, look at Zuckerberg Look at the look at the mountains, look at the factories on the river. It's very...

539
01:26:53,921 --> 01:27:08,212
It's evo of Seattle in a way. Yeah. And I really like that depiction because they're... There's a couple of one or two other stories you an earlier one where the ducks are on top of the building and they're looking over Inducks bergen, you could see the Tu bug river Yeah. And some magic

540
01:27:08,632 --> 01:27:24,791
glass. Yeah. And it's... And you you really get a sense of what the city is like. And I always... I always like Inducks Duck to either Seattle or Portland. I always put it in the Pacific Northwest in my mind. For some reason because I always see that like kind of city scape with the surrounding

541
01:27:25,092 --> 01:27:51,197
suburbs and then the kind of industrial section, all kind of incorporating one, you know, one one one of this though. Yeah. That is love. And I and I definitely think of those like factories as representing, you know, the ones that Scrooge is gonna talk about in a few panels. What about you? What panels did did you really, you know, respond to or? Which ones really caught you by surprised by this reading? So I wanna reiterate again, but that that second page,

542
01:27:51,897 --> 01:27:54,077
know that fourth page where he's

543
01:27:55,057 --> 01:28:05,645
disappearing and he goes to talk to his clerk and how every expression is better in the last but specifically, I wanna call out the panel where his clerk is reading out the figures,

544
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,162
and he's like biting his finger

545
01:28:08,515 --> 01:28:11,742
in in anticipation. I I find that one whole hilarious.

546
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:23,983
But there there are just so many wonder ones every every panel during their money fights, I remember as a kid always loving the one where he just utterly yells

547
01:28:24,336 --> 01:28:25,436
long tons

548
01:28:25,737 --> 01:28:26,237
short

549
01:28:27,256 --> 01:28:53,086
just that just cracks me up that that little guy. So really, really a great story Dan. I didn't I think we did a great job of covering this one. But, listen Thank you as always. I really enjoyed it. And this is this was a pleasure to come back to again, this is one of those I haven't read, you know, quite a few years. So this was... It's nice to see this thing fresh eyes. Yeah. Absolutely. I and treat to have you back on dan. I really appreciate it. That's awesome.

550
01:28:53,464 --> 01:28:58,953
So I I would definitely encourage people to reach out. If they wanna share their thoughts. We're we're

551
01:28:59,266 --> 01:29:10,261
present on the socials, Facebook and Instagram. And please check in on our next adventure length episode where we get to talk about back long ago.

552
01:29:10,841 --> 01:29:15,461
Dan dean mind reading the last panel to close the

553
01:29:15,921 --> 01:29:17,636
episode out Yeah. Absolutely.

554
01:29:18,216 --> 01:29:18,716
