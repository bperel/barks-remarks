00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,128
Hello. I'm Mark Sever. I'm a longtime

Carl Barks fan. I've been to Karl Marx since I was about seven or eight years old

00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:11,581

That's right. Excellent.

16
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:40,481
So Eric,

17
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:50,420
gave you a little bit of a kind of a caveat or warning ahead of time that this one is not one of my favorite favorite

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,540
comics,

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,420
but

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,740
I don't want to...

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,714
I don't wanna give it short sc

22
00:01:58,212 --> 00:02:02,783
because today, we're talking about kind of an unusual story.

23
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:06,536
This one is called too many pets

24
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:07,986
this is

25
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:09,460
from nineteen

26
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:11,890
forty three, September,

27
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:22,471
that's the same month that, we talked about Donald and the mum ring. And that's because this comic book was

28
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:27,280
included in that same one. This is a very rare case

29
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,120
where there were two full length stories

30
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:39,090
in one com. They were both published in four twenty nine the the old one shot series. This was the b story, very much the b store

31
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,370
And truth be told, you know i

32
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,170
I debated a little bit about whether to include this one in the chronological

33
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,819
you, list of official

34
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:52,408
long adventure stories.

35
00:02:52,904 --> 00:03:04,930
And so this this podcast is not that. This podcast is not us sub doing every one of them. The the Barks stories are pretty pretty well delineate in the long adventure stories and in the short, usually

36
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:06,305
ten page

37
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:07,705
gag stories.

38
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,225
And this one is not really

39
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:11,945
much of an adventure

40
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,340
It's not a ten page gag story. It's as long as the adventure stories.

41
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:41,923
And so, you know, I kind of took the opportunity to sit down and think about what what's my criteria for these longer stories and which ones are we gonna do episodes for? And I decided kind of arbitrarily but not really to basically do the cut off at fifteen pages, which is fifty percent more than the the ten pager. So that might same kind of an obscure thing to worry about, but, you know, I had to make a dividing line somewhere.

42
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,555
This one at least does have some

43
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,227
intrigued some danger

44
00:03:48,018 --> 00:04:00,475
you know, it's not say that it's not an adventure at Al. That that this one is different in a few ways. And so This is a story just like the title suggests in which the nephews have too many pets.

45
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,970
They're gonna get an ultimatum from their uncle Donald

46
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:06,364
and they have to get rid of them.

47
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:07,799
But through a,

48
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:19,269
they convince him that they can keep a monkey that they get from an organ grinder. Donald eventually tires quickly tires of the monkey, and he sells it to a sinister person,

49
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:24,240
and the nephews realized that he seems to have some plans for that monkey.

50
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,080
Kind of an unusual one

51
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,599
in a few ways

52
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,680
and

53
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,375
we're gonna talk a little bit

54
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:38,195
about... We talked last episode. I had Ryan on you you and I know Ryan very well for a long time.

55
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,310
We had already talked about

56
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,950
what it happens during this month in history.

57
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,125
Obviously, we're still in the hype

58
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:50,237
World War two, we will be for a few more episodes.

59
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:57,435
This one doesn't have cover art by Barks, which is kind of unusual just because it was the b

60
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:58,471
story.

61
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:06,985
There was actually even a ten pager sandwich between these. So he was like, really pro prolific it for this specific issue.

62
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:08,185
And

63
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:12,439
I mentioned that this one's pretty unusual. This one was actually

64
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:13,516
started

65
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:15,989
by another

66
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:16,826
writer

67
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,179
named Mer Dame.

68
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:21,492
He

69
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:31,509
he abandoned the story. Apparently, he got fed up with working on it or he was overwhelmed in his other role, but I didn't know this. He was actually...

70
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:33,547
He worked with Floyd Got

71
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:44,989
who did the Mickey mouse comic strip. Mh. So I I thought floyd got and did those on his zone before I was researching this, but I learned that he had a lot of collaborate, including this guy. So

72
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:48,619
this is kind of like the first story you did where Barks,

73
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,199
you know, collaborated with Hannah

74
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:56,819
for Donald duck finds pirate. So you kinda are getting slot into these unusual ones here.

75
00:05:57,354 --> 00:05:57,854
Right?

76
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,685
So I I noted in

77
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:02,737
researching this one too,

78
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:03,836
that

79
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:09,398
the... It's assumed that this might have actually started as a mickey mouse story

80
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:10,317
since

81
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:13,793
Mari was the one who worked on it. And

82
00:06:14,452 --> 00:06:20,284
they gave... They basically gave it to Barks and he reworked it. He polished it. He developed an ending.

83
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:21,204
But...

84
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:23,419
Yeah, I think that's kinda interesting

85
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,539
Sure. I can see that dealing with World two seven tours Al much more of a mickey thing,

86
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,474
I believe. Yeah. It's have mysteries and secrets and stuff

87
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:38,834
mickey mouse thing and I just don't know how all this would played with the clue of scenario. And

88
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:42,022
Kudos good jealous or something for that.

89
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:48,993
Right. No you're right. I I think that's more of a hallmark of the mickey stories. Have you read any of those got and ones.

90
00:06:49,768 --> 00:06:54,610
I don't know. Any Yet have I've not nat familiar with the writers all these.

91
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:58,459
Right red fifty stuff. Yeah. If you read a.

92
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:10,741
Chances are pretty good that it was by floyd of God He's he's phenomenal. And and, you know, I'm talking a little bit about floyd god and again because this is not... This one's not the strongest ours works.

93
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:15,467
No. No not. I But it but it definitely has its merit.

94
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:20,714
Another little bit of interesting trivia that I found, you know, there was a write up I had

95
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:23,509
I had a graphic novel that

96
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:25,163
reprinted this one.

97
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:26,341
And,

98
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:35,968
you know, they... The editor of that, he kinda had a little write up about it. And he described Barks having spent a lot of his youth working on ranches,

99
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:38,020
working around animals.

100
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,040
Barks apparently was fond of talking about how he was...

101
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:47,027
He he used... Do he spent some time as a mule skinner

102
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:50,317
but not a very efficient one.

103
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:54,133
And I don't like that the mental image that that brings up.

104
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:56,431
Customer.

105
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:09,454
So let's let's talk just a little bit more background kind of about the the era and the time where we summarize this story. To me the really interesting

106
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,290
kind of time capsule thing, the historical

107
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:19,083
artifact in this story is the oregon grinder. Have have you ever... Have you ever seen an oregon grinder Eric?

108
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:21,009
With

109
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:24,405
and real life. Yeah. Trend think.

110
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:29,651
I mean, nope know that I have. No. Like in pop culture,

111
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:33,137
growing up watching pop culture in the eighties,

112
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:38,476
it felt like we might expect to see Oregon grinder all over the place. But... Right.

113
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:45,350
And and reading the story got me like, to thinking about it and wondering, you know, how did that become a thing?

114
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:50,488
And so I got I got a little bit down the rabbit hole with oregon ordinary. Mh.

115
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:51,803
But apparently,

116
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:58,085
Oregon grinder became popular in the late nineteenth century, early twentieth century.

117
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:02,100
And and they were first popular mostly in Italy.

118
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:07,299
And then they... And then they spread to Europe and then they spread to America.

119
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:08,357
And

120
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:15,197
by... Maybe not this time a little bit earlier, I they were probably waning around this time. But

121
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:18,953
apparently, they were like a huge nuisance in New York City.

122
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:20,352
And that's

123
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:21,850
mayor Laguardia,

124
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:25,319
who my Italian grandmother was very fond of.

125
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:26,836
He

126
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:37,360
banned the instrument, the old like barrel organ from the streets in nineteen thirty five because of the congestion and the begging and and, you know, some Italian

127
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,160
italian stereotypes

128
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:49,785
and and just attitudes of the time. And I guess really organized crime was kind of kinda wrapped up in it and and renting them out to the grinder.

129
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:55,128
And apparently, the monkeys were a real thing. They usually use cup cap monkeys.

130
00:09:55,786 --> 00:10:07,019
So that... That to me is fascinating. Right? Like that we we talked in our first episode about how that one looked kind of timeless, but this one looks super dated. Yes.

131
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:19,122
Like, that's that's a pretty big sign signify. Yeah. We're pretty much different now. So for notable, appearances, we don't really have any of all appearances. We've got Donald the Nephews

132
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:27,090
and then a couple of one off characters, the the grinder that we mentioned and Gin, the monkey and the the spy.

133
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,050
So

134
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:36,625
let's go ahead go through the story itself So at the beginning of too many pets.

135
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:40,065
We've got Donald on a classic rampage page.

136
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:53,074
And I do think this is very Barks. And we'll see a lot of this. You know, he is he's in spring cleaning mode or something, and he is venting and raging at all of the nephews pets

137
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:54,430
that are

138
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:58,680
coming up his his cleaning him. Yeah Wonder

139
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,840
there's way kept there. But just keep see them he seeing the panels, any references.

140
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:12,375
Looks like I think it does bad. Yeah. We've got puppies and turtles and a frog and a Canary or some bird and Al cat.

141
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,070
Yeah. He's... I I kind of understand where he's coming from. It definitely is too many pets.

142
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,510
So on on the next page,

143
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:23,705
Donald gives them an ultimatum. He says...

144
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:27,625
Oh, not even ultimatum. He dictates that they're getting rid of the pets.

145
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:31,514
He is giving them all to something called the Pet society.

146
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:35,361
They're they're asking are we never gonna be allowed to have pets.

147
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,622
He tells them no and he gives them a pretty specific but broad statement

148
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:46,126
that, no. Not unless it's something different and he he gives a list of all the common

149
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:54,072
pets you might have no more cats, dogs, birds, frogs bugs, and my fats, fish or reptile, conveniently

150
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,641
leaving out monkeys.

151
00:11:56,098 --> 00:12:11,424
And indeed... I just... I love just make sure the kids because it's so true kids there with Al everything you say and your ten get my meaning, and they say, no. This is what you said. And didn't say this. That's right. Know everything else. Kids are good or Barks.

152
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:11,964
Yeah.

153
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,973
I alright. So Donald,

154
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:21,038
and the next page, Donald goes back in the house and he gets ready to take a soothing bath. He reflects on

155
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:26,721
on what he said and considers whether he was too harsh,

156
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:33,839
but just as he gets into the bath or is about to, their fraud that they miss jumps into his robe

157
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:35,155
and

158
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:36,990
upsets him again.

159
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:42,109
And the last panel on this page, we see him cutting a witch,

160
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:52,553
an old tree branch that they would call a switch to get ready to... And it's... It's it's a pretty funny panel. He says I'll make it up to them now,

161
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:53,552
but

162
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,070
that's definitely

163
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:57,108
a a sign of the times.

164
00:12:57,806 --> 00:12:57,926
Right.

165
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:07,322
Yes. And and again, I don't know about you, but this was a very common depiction. I saw this in comics and cartoons all the time.

166
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:11,352
And it's you would not see this today. This would

167
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,348
would definitely be viewed as abusive.

168
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:15,605
Yeah.

169
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:18,120
The f user t and downtown

170
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,400
looking very for

171
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,130
and they come across an and grind with a monkey.

172
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:31,480
And I gotta say the monkey really cute. It's I think a nice little bit of art design

173
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:35,073
we we hear the organ grinder

174
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:40,861
is talking in very stereotype accent to Al, saying he likes kids,

175
00:13:42,215 --> 00:13:44,835
and and they really appreciate his fro

176
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:48,970
and they wish out loud that they could have a pet like him.

177
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:57,024
And at that point, the organ grinder turns around and we get a good look at him and he is just the most Disney

178
00:13:58,282 --> 00:13:59,301
Italian stereotype.

179
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:01,438
Yes Yes.

180
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:05,135
Yeah. That you could imagine, and he offers

181
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:13,083
to... He offers to give them the monkey. And done. But so think of his covers like, yeah. That's really

182
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:25,230
dated, but knowing the time like i I can see where we're going. Yeah. This was just shorthand for this is an Italian. Yeah. I get a kick out this is as half italian myself. So I really appreciate

183
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,270
stereotype

184
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,790
depictions of

185
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:31,721
of my people in media. Because it's usually...

186
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,357
It's usually a lot more gentle than

187
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:35,775
many groups.

188
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,530
Get it. Sure

189
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:49,405
So the nephews start to pull their money, but he explains that, no he he doesn't mean to sell Jingle that he would like to give Jingle away to them.

190
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,890
Because he just really wants a good home

191
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:56,570
because he got drafted that same day. Okay. Did...

192
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:05,705
Yeah. And and this was really striking to me because in most Barks stories, even during this area, you don't really see like a direct mention

193
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,125
of the war.

194
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,560
Right. That's not say there are none of them. But

195
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,491
it's not it's not very common at all to to to see the war in truth like that.

196
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:27,526
And then before he gives them Django, he does warn them about Jin one low Barks if you put your hands

197
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:30,562
behind your head in kind of the universal

198
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:32,080
relaxing posture

199
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:44,305
he gets in enraged and he throws whatever he can get at you. That's not fortunately. No. No. Not at all. And i'll make sure to to go back to this to to make sure we remember this a couple of times.

200
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:48,895
You know, this is that kind convenient plot device that.

201
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:55,185
You know, we don't... We're not opposed to question. This just kinda loose moves the story forward.

202
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:56,225
So

203
00:15:57,045 --> 00:16:01,080
quirk and it does. It does. And I like Jingle. He's cute.

204
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,840
Alright. So on the next page, the Nephews are bringing

205
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,164
Gin back to... And then they're debating how they're gonna break the news to their uncle.

206
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,949
And they see him with that dreaded switch in his hand.

207
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:20,390
And and they plan to send go ahead

208
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:22,344
to kind of

209
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,065
soothe him ahead of time and make him more open to

210
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:27,425
So

211
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:42,630
Jin rings the bell. The oregon grinder has explained to them how smart he is he understands almost everything you say. So they give him the instructions to go ring the bell, and he presents donald with an apple. And again,

212
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:47,470
for reasons of plot Donald thinks that he's a boy, a little boy instead

213
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:51,822
obviously, he's a monk. And so Donald accepts the apple.

214
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,293
I also like that you know, during this, like, post depression era and,

215
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:04,445
you know, war scarcity era, apples are a treat. Right? That's something else that I see in in media from this time.

216
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,359
And so Donald

217
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:09,408
the when Huey, realizes that was a monkey.

218
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:10,526
He

219
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:15,415
goes to look for the monkey and while he's distracted the nephews bring him in, and they have

220
00:17:16,153 --> 00:17:19,686
gin served on the nice tray of treats,

221
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:21,700
milk and donuts, I think.

222
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:24,170
Oh I like this part where

223
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:26,805
Gin goes and

224
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:28,522
starts a record,

225
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,915
because that was kind of a treat seeing an old

226
00:17:32,373 --> 00:17:36,645
and Donald record collection. Yeah, It looks like this version of Donald got

227
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:37,765
pretty nice

228
00:17:38,105 --> 00:17:38,905
pretty nice setup.

229
00:17:39,945 --> 00:17:40,265
Yeah.

230
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:45,340
I'm kinda but that out an actual song that they just made it up. Going on the...

231
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,460
That panel.

232
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,475
I I definitely Googled it, and it's definitely not a real sign.

233
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:53,595
But it is Donald favorite. So...

234
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:59,088
So I guess that that's Canon. Right? We've just identified Donald Doug favorite on and

235
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:17,018
one of us needs to update the wikipedia page. Yes. So the nephews used catch Donald pondering out out. This monkey is so helped they rules lawyer Donald into a agreeing to keep Gene. Wouldn't Al lot of pet flash butler. Yeah. Exactly. They are celebrating that they get to keep Jingle.

236
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:18,235
Donald

237
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:29,920
tells them, hey, stop celebrating you need to go do your chores. There's some cans that need to be thrown into the salvage box. And again, I I think that might be a reference to

238
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,760
wartime scarcity. Right? That'll go just the hands for the cameras.

239
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,440
So the nephews are painstakingly

240
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,333
throwing the cans in and they got the bright idea

241
00:18:41,752 --> 00:18:45,049
to use gin quirk to have him

242
00:18:45,388 --> 00:19:03,990
throw the cans at them while they're sitting in the salvage box. Yes. I have a okay. I just remembered something the three reinforce that caught device. Dawn all his exercise and on the other side of the window in a way that is kind reminiscent of doing that. And the App use are too late to stop jingle from

243
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:11,103
shocking Al can through the window and beam Donald on the head Donald is upset of course, and he

244
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:15,983
demands to know who threw it. All of the Nephews take the lane instant.

245
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:30,267
The nephews get ready to take their punishment from that switch. They tell Donald that they wanna set example for Django, That's why they fest up so quickly. And Gin, our Donald orders jingle to do the

246
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:31,185
spanking,

247
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,950
but Jingle refuses he breaks the...

248
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:40,435
He breaks the switch over his knee, sending Donald into a rage. And then on the next page,

249
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:44,702
It's basically a sequence where Gin has

250
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,736
gone missing in the house and he's

251
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:49,731
causing some chaos

252
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:52,185
breaking a jam jar,

253
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:54,785
messing up mcdonald's kitchen,

254
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:58,639
that continues onto the next page there's more chaos.

255
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:01,835
We're just supposed to get the idea here that

256
00:20:02,814 --> 00:20:08,162
Jin is causing a huge mess in Mcdonald's clean house. Good stuff.

257
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:08,999
Yep.

258
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:13,984
I I understand that they will do sometimes what they see.

259
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:29,053
So eventually, he falls in to the garage. He lights on a very cool looking old fashioned lawn mower, and I like I like seeing Donald crying over his tulip lips, his pants sees his rare, never bloom hypo der.

260
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,158
Which should you know.

261
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,210
I didn't Google that one. I'm guessing it's awesome.

262
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:45,739
I I I chuckle, never bloom. That's just great. Right? Like, That's genuinely. We've got the consequences,

263
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:55,049
Donald is furious. And he says you've got to get rid of that. Monk. He tells them they can't even come back into the house until they figured out.

264
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,602
Oh you know what to do with him. And that's

265
00:20:58,074 --> 00:21:01,725
definitely old fashioned, you're not gonna kick your kids out of the house. I hope

266
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:06,049
They realized that they can't even go back in the house for their coats.

267
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:08,003
So they order Gin

268
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:10,716
to go in through the attic,

269
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:14,440
and I'm a serious man is watching

270
00:21:14,777 --> 00:21:18,466
while they give him these instruction. Now. I do wanna know that first panel

271
00:21:19,322 --> 00:21:22,070
don was too hearted to think. Gin.

272
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:22,948
Yeah.

273
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:25,025
But yeah. He was also

274
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:31,067
wanting ding to make the boys who's exactly we was thinking, which is just I love the...

275
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:35,428
Right. I would be convenient from the right Child abuse, not animal abuse, I guess.

276
00:21:36,598 --> 00:21:38,692
Right. This this mysterious

277
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:43,845
guy who, you know, he's he's very creepy looking, but he's also very engineer.

278
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:47,434
We we just had a couple of podcasts where

279
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,466
some version of Pete

280
00:21:49,803 --> 00:21:57,414
was the villain. Right? The one that you purchased participated in. He was called Black pete. And then the one that Ryan was on, the mummy ring.

281
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:06,481
It was there was a black pete look lookalike in that one. Think again, old Disney habits die hard. But this guy is just kind of generic sinister.

282
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:19,555
And he notes that the monkey responds to commands and he wants to buy the monkey. And the nephews are outraged. They don't want Donald sell him, but he goes through with it and the nephew

283
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:20,515
are

284
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,275
left to cry.

285
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:27,055
We we learn on the next page, what man's purpose for django is,

286
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,210
he is near a factory

287
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,130
complex and we see him

288
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,610
on on the phone, again, a very old school

289
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,170
style phone

290
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:42,665
talking to someone about leaving some plans near the window. He's using Jingle

291
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:43,505
to

292
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:47,197
to steal some plants. So he's up in very

293
00:22:47,974 --> 00:22:48,474
Military.

294
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:57,750
Yes. No doubt. He gives him the directions to go in through the window and take the plans, but before he can return him to the window washer station

295
00:22:58,248 --> 00:23:02,260
that the spy is at. Gin starts to miss the nephews

296
00:23:03,118 --> 00:23:05,627
and the spy sees jingle

297
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:30,313
go in the direction and figures that he's returning to the Like, oh I'm missed those boys. I spent an hour where. I we with them. Yeah. Very very convenient. But they had a great time together. Right? So Sure. So G comes back to the net use with the plans, but they don't realize what it is. They just know that it's thick paper that seems perfect for for making paper airplanes.

298
00:23:30,771 --> 00:23:39,550
And I I thought It was a sign of the times that they were imagining, you know, mine's a p forty seven. Mine's a torpedo bomber. Clearly

299
00:23:39,890 --> 00:24:06,788
right out of the war. And then hue puts a pin on the nose of one, so it'll stick stick up to things. Any jingle throw it. Which, you know, predictably it lands right Donald, but before Donald can get mad, he realizes what the papers were what the documents are, and he becomes very scared. And I can't remember if we've already seen that the plans are for something called a bomb site, but at some point,

300
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:13,408
they mentioned that that's what the plans are for. And that wasn't in the term that I was familiar with. I assume it's like a precursor

301
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,100
to radar or something. But... Well, in my in my incentive

302
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,300
watching up old two movies,

303
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:30,030
no bomb sites you know, it's for the bomber. So you wanna be able to get an accurate picture around, where you're dropping with being that high elevation. It's not so much a sensor, like a radar.

304
00:24:30,548 --> 00:24:32,300
But it's just Al location,

305
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:39,575
advocate the magnification device of how to get a better clear shot around where your boss are gonna go so you can be more

306
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:43,410
Like doing screen or something like that? Yeah.

307
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:45,607
With the privilege for the

308
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:52,294
world war two it it's... The bomb sites get used a lot as the

309
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,345
military, but, you know, designed come in?

310
00:24:55,645 --> 00:25:01,945
Yeah. Because obviously, at this time, they didn't know about, you know, the the Med manhattan Project. So it's just...

311
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:06,118
What could something general public could be familiar with. Right.

312
00:25:06,457 --> 00:25:10,133
Something did know. Yeah. I'm sure if you're years you later.

313
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:17,165
Just a few years later these plans would have and having to do with with nuclear weapons notes. So Donald

314
00:25:17,665 --> 00:25:20,545
tells them to hide the plans and he's gonna go after the cops.

315
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:35,335
I guess he doesn't have a phone at home because he leaves them. And on the next page, they've just hit the plans under the bed when they get knocked at the door. And and it is the spy. And he demands... He... He says he doesn't care about the monkey.

316
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:40,029
Du monk as he calls him. He just cares about the plans

317
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:55,715
and the nephews fuse. The nephew start to stall him. She Barks in and he grabs them, and he he ties them up and this is, you know, kind of kinda disturbing. Right? Because he gives him like, a tickle torture and then he

318
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,610
escalate

319
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,850
to

320
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,370
his other method, which is to tie candles

321
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,221
to their feet and let the candles run down.

322
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:12,127
So while he's waiting for them to talk, he leans back in the classic

323
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:14,536
relaxation posture. Oh no.

324
00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:15,630
And, of course.

325
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:18,361
Yeah. We've got Jin who

326
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,005
does what Jin does best

327
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,461
and he brings the guy with a vase.

328
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,640
And

329
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:29,815
I mean, this is this is a funny animal comic. So it just knocks him out.

330
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,130
But in the real world, that that guy's dead. Okay.

331
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:40,542
Yeah. So Jin saved the day and on the last page Donald couldn't be more pleased. He's beam.

332
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,819
And he

333
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:52,414
he leans back to enjoy, you know, the end of a busy day and he puts his hand behind his head and Jingle brains him with a coconut

334
00:26:52,751 --> 00:27:03,570
and the the comic ends with the nephews trying to fan him awake and and saying, oh, yeah. We we should probably remember to tell him about that. And that is

335
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:16,490
too many pets Any any kind of initial thoughts you have about this one here. Well, really it It's still very stuck Mh here you talked about how somebody we start

336
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:19,855
this day. Like that's only see that

337
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,517
that okay. This is tara Have to go with it and supply. It feels very

338
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:34,668
generic. You know, plugged in Al lots of different people that opinion in this unique. Who makes me feel like it's a week novel or Ducktales product, I mean, they pretty angry.

339
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:37,785
Right. But even he but even then when he

340
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:40,981
found the plants typically was dog. Gets angry.

341
00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:43,869
He's stays angry he stays hot?

342
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:46,940
It's just... But it's a good comic. I mean, it's definitely

343
00:27:47,357 --> 00:27:54,740
an example of it's time. I'm not gonna say it's bad. I mean, me it's it's very typical, but it rose when was made.

344
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:16,915
It seems very fitting. And, you know, the I you're saying is a voluntary aspect that it is a little odd, but I definitely see what you're saying. But this was the second adventure in a you in a comment. Because feels like a second invention, not like, one like, oh, Huey,, guys. Two. That's this is gonna because there's box with that this one. Yeah. There's a mic and did normal story.

345
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:23,450
Yeah. There's definitely a reason that they put the mummy ring first. You know, that was obviously a labor of love

346
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:27,876
for Barks and the first one we got to really do everything

347
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:33,632
himself. I agree with you. This one feels very, like, familiar are in it's pacing.

348
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:36,023
You know, i kinda like how it starts out

349
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,697
a little bit wacky.

350
00:28:38,432 --> 00:28:47,140
I think one of the reasons that it's nice that we get to include this, even if it's not my favorite is that it it... It's almost a stand in for those ten pager.

351
00:28:47,655 --> 00:28:50,035
Know because there are so many of them and,

352
00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:53,835
you know the album that I read this in that collected this one,

353
00:28:54,669 --> 00:29:01,043
they included several other of the pet stories because Bart went back to this kind of well alarm.

354
00:29:01,582 --> 00:29:04,060
And they wanted those. They were great.

355
00:29:04,594 --> 00:29:05,094
Like

356
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:09,957
the the three or four other stories in this. I enjoyed them so much more

357
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:15,280
even though they were quote just ten pager just sc stories. But

358
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,080
but some of those gag stories are

359
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,930
just wonderfully written and and very funny with some amazing art. So

360
00:29:23,306 --> 00:29:30,516
you know, I I don't wanna dump on this one too much because again, he was working within the limitation of of story that was already developed.

361
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:31,354
And

362
00:29:31,851 --> 00:29:32,670
what I say

363
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:45,635
yeah. We're just saying he done better and it's just feels what not his best work, and that's fine. Yeah. Yeah. There was not not too much that stood out to this one. And again, like, other stories

364
00:29:46,189 --> 00:29:52,234
that were next to it. We're much more enjoyable to it. I took a look, of course, as we always do

365
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:58,071
Al the web page index that is the, you know, aggregation page

366
00:29:58,966 --> 00:29:59,466
for

367
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:06,023
user submitted reviews. And this one had a a rating of seven point one

368
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:09,735
out of over forty thousand reviews.

369
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:16,505
It or out of forty thousand some comic stories rather, it was

370
00:30:16,885 --> 00:30:19,240
ranked one thousand nine hundred and

371
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:20,238
one.

372
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:28,674
And those numbers don't mean too much on their own. So just for perspective, you know, you and I did hierarchical. That one had a rating seven point three.

373
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:31,431
And then

374
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:36,245
Ryan and I did the mommy's ring, which was a seven point six.

375
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:44,460
If you look at those stories kind of within all of the comics there compared to pirate gold was in the top.

376
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:49,322
Was rated higher than ninety eight point four

377
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:59,669
percent of all the stories. And mommy's ring was rated higher than nine nine point three percent. So that one's you know, very highly rated.

378
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:02,835
This one is is in the top ninety

379
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:07,575
fifth percentile or I guess the top fifth percentile. So you know, it's Barks.

380
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:13,522
So it's well regarded, but it's down definitely not rated as highly as those other ones.

381
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:19,803
As far as how it holds up, I did think it was really interesting

382
00:31:20,821 --> 00:31:21,321
to

383
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,955
get to read this one and and really see a lot of

384
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:30,970
what was contemporary at that time, you know, see some of those things like the organ grinder

385
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:37,301
and the references to the world two planes and the casual corporal punishment.

386
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,277
So that that's Always interesting to see.

387
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,947
We talk about to appearances in other media. Obviously,

388
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:52,270
as is fitting for a comic that's, you know, not nearly one of his popular ones. This is one that's really been adapted.

389
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:56,219
It's been reprinted a few times, of course, not as much as some of the others.

390
00:31:57,075 --> 00:32:01,310
Barb never did any of his oil paintings or lit graphs,

391
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:08,592
featuring this and my knowledge, there was nothing referencing this in any of the duct.

392
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:29,994
But I can't I can't think that there was. But as I mentioned, you know, Barks, this was the first of his pet stories, which he went back to a lot, and he did some great stories featuring those. Sure. I I like to talk about what there is know in terms of educational Al. Some of these stories have some interesting things that we might learn about history or mythology

393
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:30,912
or,

394
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:32,307
you know, geography,

395
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:38,506
i didn't really take anything too interesting to this one. You know, by nature, it's not one of the Barks sort of

396
00:32:38,884 --> 00:32:52,718
travel log ones you know so it doesn't really have that gone. But again, I don't wanna dump on this one too much. It's still... Nice it's a Barks story, and it's still still very worth reading and and very worthwhile. Yes.

397
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:56,844
So Eric, do you have any other thoughts

398
00:32:57,462 --> 00:32:59,361
regarding too many paths.

399
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,930
Well, like you're saying, like, this obviously, there's the rats or any

400
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:08,246
based off this book app up this story, and I had to

401
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:12,601
really agree him like obviously because there's not really any that scenery

402
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:17,130
those background white type of shots that he uses

403
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:25,966
whether it's the transitioning from, you know, from the ship to the sea. I did, you know, where the ship seen where we i to get on the ice higher gold.

404
00:33:27,062 --> 00:33:36,735
But there were a couple and know just artistic that I I appreciate it and that is right there that picture you're looking at is Huey, use a couple of uses that I think once twice.

405
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,370
Is the shadow

406
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:44,350
of the person in the foreground shadow or the person that you reported that in the background is being color.

407
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,025
Just to give you that

408
00:33:46,523 --> 00:33:48,260
emphasis what's going on in the scene.

409
00:33:48,757 --> 00:33:52,806
I'm using them completely in shadow. He doesn't have to do that very

410
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:54,321
some pretty good

411
00:33:54,778 --> 00:34:03,894
contracts. What's going on. Yeah. It's the scene. And then there's no on where dog is. You have what's like the window and installed and dark.

412
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:08,763
And the folks talking and the the emphasis the voice and the reaction, I think.

413
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:11,716
And it's just it's a very neat to see that

414
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:15,358
That's not stuff. That's generally do or used in a comic

415
00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:17,390
for the kids audience.

416
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,281
Together two pounds I really enjoy.

417
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:22,466
What's what? When they're were all

418
00:34:22,803 --> 00:34:27,208
boys working like... Okay. Gotta get the down oh god. Appreciate your question.

419
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:36,893
And they're all over the head and i'll hurt the row. That's all the same. And Gin is right there with the like he's one of the crew. Yeah. That was cool. That's perfectly.

420
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:39,210
Okay. What doing? She's in on there.

421
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,247
And and then

422
00:34:42,105 --> 00:34:44,978
as I thought that very and then it's the scene where

423
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,455
jin is breaking the switch.

424
00:34:47,874 --> 00:34:49,233
Oh, yeah. We're cracks.

425
00:34:50,112 --> 00:34:56,371
He's very expressive, but our everything there's very much to the the pay. This is a monkey.

426
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,643
He recognizes what's going on.

427
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,295
She's not gonna do it.

428
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:05,956
And he's bad about it. Yeah. You're right about the expression on this face. And I'm mean

429
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:07,211
That was really good.

430
00:35:08,223 --> 00:35:09,282
Yeah. Agreed.

431
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:16,600
And I'm I'm glad that you remembered I had asked for you to dimension your favorites panel, and I forgot to introduce that. But

432
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:23,615
that's funny because you you mentioned two of the ones that I had thought of which that that switch break can

433
00:35:23,995 --> 00:35:31,695
scene definitely a panel definitely stuck out to me. But the long panel that is on, I think it's on page

434
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:36,185
nineteen or so, but the one where the nephews are waving by

435
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,341
to Jingle go, It shows them looking for lauren

436
00:35:39,814 --> 00:35:44,619
gin waving back, Donald looking pleased over the the hedge.

437
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,689
That that one has... It's just a really cool

438
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:50,896
panel and really sums up, I think the story.

439
00:35:51,793 --> 00:36:10,409
Yeah. And it kinda shows, you know, Donald kind of a bit of a villain, not not maybe a bad guy, but he's definitely not a great... He's not a very positive character in this one. And I think that's part of why I don't really care for this one compared a lot of them. And we see this more in some of the earlier ones where that's a little bit more of his

440
00:36:10,865 --> 00:36:12,775
characterization. Yeah. So,

441
00:36:13,313 --> 00:36:17,608
thank you very much. I I always like talking... I I love talking Du.

442
00:36:18,586 --> 00:36:28,190
You know, I told ryan last week that it's so nice to get the chance to talk about these in real life because, you know, apart from you growing up, this was the thing that I was just hugely into.

443
00:36:28,805 --> 00:36:34,345
But it always felt weird being, you know, a teenager who really likes Ducktales stories and I

444
00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:38,752
couldn't really talk about much in real life. So I'm I'm gonna make.

445
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:41,144
I'm gonna make up for last time.

446
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:43,895
The next podcast that we do

447
00:36:44,471 --> 00:36:50,747
is kind of getting back to the adventure mold and it is the story frozen gold,

448
00:36:51,305 --> 00:36:54,456
which I haven't read in many years. So I'm excited.

449
00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:10,585
To revisit that. I forgot to mention this episode and last that I looked up the upper value of this comic, you know, this can count for last steps episode two. So There was there's one documented sale of a nine point o condition, which would be like,

450
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:28,998
really near miss nice. Yeah. In in November of two thousand and eight, that sold for twenty thousand dollars. Lower range. You know, I assume most of them are one point o would be two hundred dollars. So Sure. This one's pretty highly valued because it's got two full length Barks stories hand a ten pager

451
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:39,057
and as... you know, but it's mainly valued of course for the money. Alright. Well, Eric, thank you again for joining me, and I look forward to having you back soon.

452
00:37:39,713 --> 00:37:40,652
Yeah. My pleasure.
