Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks, the podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks, creator of Scrooge Mc Ducktales writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comments of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks.

3
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,745
Hello. I'm Mark Sever. I'm a long time Carl Bark fan.

4
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:58,926
I've been into Carl Barks since I was about seven or eight years old

5
00:00:59,582 --> 00:01:06,197
and enjoyed the Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge Comics, and I am very excited to have the opportunity

6
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:10,464
to be a grown man and talk about kids comics.

7
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:11,501
And

8
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:15,470
I am for fortunate to have a returning c

9
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,350
with me today, and I'm gonna let him

And been girlfriend bad

13
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:28,837

00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:39,066
That's right. Excellent.

17
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:40,835
So, Eric, I

18
00:01:41,732 --> 00:01:47,135
gave you a little bit of a kind of a caveat or warning ahead of time that

19
00:01:47,512 --> 00:01:50,420
this one is not one of my face favorite

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,460
comics,

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,420
but

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,580
I don't want to...

23
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,674
I don't wanna give it short s

24
00:01:58,212 --> 00:02:02,643
because today we're talking about kind of an unusual story.

25
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:06,496
This one is called too many pets

26
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:08,026
this is

27
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:09,420
from nineteen

28
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:11,851
forty three September,

29
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:22,471
that's the same month. That we talked about donald and the mum ring. And that's because this comic book was

30
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:27,280
included in that same one. This is a very rare case

31
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,120
where there were two full length stories

32
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:39,090
in one common. They were both published in four color twenty nine the the old one shot series. This was the b story very much the b story

33
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,330
and truth be told, you know, I

34
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,170
I debated a little bit about whether to include this one in the chronological

35
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,819
you know list of official

36
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:52,448
long adventure stories

37
00:02:52,944 --> 00:03:04,850
And so this this podcast is not that this podcast is not us doing every one of them. The the Barks stories are pretty pretty well delineate in the long adventure stories and in the short usually

38
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:06,225
ten page

39
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:07,705
gag stories.

40
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,145
And this one is not really

41
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:11,905
much of an adventure.

42
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,220
It's not a ten page gag story. It's as long as the adventure stories.

43
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:41,782
And so, you know, I kind of took the opportunity to sit down and think about. What... What's my criteria for these longer stories and which ones are we gonna do episodes for? And I decided kind of arbitrarily but not really to basically do the cutoff off at fifteen pages, which is fifty percent more than the the ten pager. So that might seem kind of an obscure thing to worry about. But, you know, I had to make a dividing line somewhere.

44
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,555
This one at least does have some

45
00:03:45,411 --> 00:04:00,435
entry intrigued some danger. So you know, it's not say that it's not an adventure Al. That that this one is different in a few ways. And so This is a story just like the title suggests in which the Nephews have too many pets.

46
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,970
They're gonna get an ultimatum from their uncle Donald

47
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:06,364
and they have to get rid of them.

48
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:07,799
But through a,

49
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:19,269
they convince him that they can keep a monkey that they get from an oregon grind. Donald eventually tires, quickly tires of the monkey, and he sells it to a sinister person.

50
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:26,080
And the nephews realized that he seems to have some plans for that month. Kind an unusual one

51
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,599
in a few ways,

52
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:28,639
and

53
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,375
we're gonna talk a little bit

54
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:40,270
about... We we talked last episode. I had Ryan on... You you and I know Ryan very well for a long time. We we had already talked about

55
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,125
what it happens during this month in a history. Obviously, we're still in the height

56
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:50,197
world war two, we will be for a few more episodes.

57
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:57,395
This one doesn't have cover our by barcodes, which is kind of unusual just because it was the b

58
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:58,471
story.

59
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:06,985
There was actually even a ten page sandwich between these. So he was like, really pro it for this specific issue.

60
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:08,225
And

61
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:12,439
I mentioned that this one's pretty unusual. This one was actually

62
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:13,436
started

63
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,949
by another

64
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:16,786
writer

65
00:05:17,363 --> 00:05:18,799
named Merrill D.

66
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:21,452
He

67
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:33,507
He abandoned the story. Apparently, he got fed up with working on it or he was over overwhelmed in his other role. But I didn't know this. He was actually... He worked with Floyd Gut

68
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:36,243
who did the Mickey Mouse comic strip.

69
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:44,989
So I I thought Floyd Got and did those on his down before I was researching this, but I learned that he had a lot of collaborate including this guy. So

70
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:48,619
this is kind of like the first story you did where Barks,

71
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:56,819
you know, collaborated with Hannah for for Donald that finds pirate vault. So you kinda are getting slot into these unusual ones here.

72
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:57,814
Sorry.

73
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,685
So I I noted in

74
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:02,698
researching this one too,

75
00:06:03,256 --> 00:06:03,756
that

76
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:07,079
the... It's assumed that this might have

77
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:09,437
started as a mickey mouse story

78
00:06:09,777 --> 00:06:10,277
since

79
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:13,793
Mer was the one who worked on it. And

80
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:20,184
when they gave... They basically gave it to Barks. And he reworked. He polished it. He developed and ending.

81
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:21,164
But

82
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:23,344
yeah. I think that's kinda interesting.

83
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,319
Sure. I can see that dealing with four two Severino tours is much more of a mid thing.

84
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,919
I believe. Yeah.

85
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,554
Mystery mysteries and secrets and stuff much. The

86
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:38,834
mickey mouse thing and I just thought how long this would played. But the clue scenario and

87
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:39,969
twenty of

88
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:48,953
it's jones or something for that? Right. No. You're right. I I think that's more of a hallmark of the Mickey Stories. Have you read any of those got ones.

89
00:06:49,768 --> 00:06:51,981
I don't know yet have. I've

90
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:54,429
not familiar with the writers all these.

91
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:55,499
Right

92
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,259
stuff. Yeah. If you read,

93
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:10,720
chances are pretty good that it was by floyd of God. He's he's phenomenal. And and, you know, I'm talking a little bit about Floyd God again because this is not this one's not the strongest of ours works.

94
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:12,537
No. No

95
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:15,207
But it but it definitely has its merit.

96
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:20,714
Another little bit of interesting trivia that I found, you know, there was a ride up I had

97
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:23,469
I had a graphic novel that

98
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:26,302
reprinted this one. And,

99
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:35,888
you know, they... The editor of that, he kinda had a little write up about it. And he described Barks having spent a lot of his youth working on ranches,

100
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:37,922
working around.

101
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,000
Barks apparently was fond of talking about how he was.

102
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:46,846
He he used to spend some time as a mule skinner.

103
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:50,057
But not a very efficient one.

104
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:54,093
And I don't like that the mental image that that brings up.

105
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,170
The thing?

106
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:09,454
So let's let's talk just a little bit more background kind of about the the area and the time, where we summarize this story. To me the really interesting

107
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,290
kinda of time capsule thing, the historical

108
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:19,021
artifact in this story is the Oregon grinder. Have have you ever... Have you ever seen an oregon grinder Eric?

109
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:24,365
With a and real what. Yeah. Trying to think.

110
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:29,611
I mean, don't know that I have no. Like in pop culture,

111
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:33,159
growing up watching pop culture in the eighties.

112
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:38,016
It felt like we might expect to see Oregon riders all over the place. But Right.

113
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:45,350
And and reading this story got me, like, to thinking about it and wondering, you know, how did that become a thing?

114
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:50,227
And so I got i got a little bit down the rabbit hole with Oregon ordinary. Mh.

115
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:51,763
But apparently,

116
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:58,085
Oregon Grinder became popular in the late nineteenth century early twentieth century.

117
00:08:59,063 --> 00:09:02,100
And and they were first popular mostly in Italy.

118
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:07,281
And then they... And then they spread to Europe, and then they spread to America.

119
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:08,357
And

120
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:09,474
by

121
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:15,157
maybe not this time a little bit earlier, I they were probably w around this time. But,

122
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:18,913
apparently, they were like a huge nuisance in New York City.

123
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:20,032
And

124
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:21,790
Mary Laguardia,

125
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,939
who my Italian grandmother was very fond of.

126
00:09:26,296 --> 00:09:26,796
He

127
00:09:27,214 --> 00:09:37,320
band the instrument, the old like Barrel Oregon from the streets in nineteenth thirty five because of the congestion and the begging and and, you know, some Italian

128
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,160
stereotypes

129
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,455
and and just

130
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:43,672
attitudes of the time.

131
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:49,745
And I guess ordering organized crime was kind of kinda wrapped up in it and renting them out to the grinder.

132
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:55,088
And apparently, the monkeys were a real thing they usually use Cup Ka p monkeys.

133
00:09:55,786 --> 00:10:06,599
So that that to me is fascinating. Right? Like, like that. We we talked in our first episode about how that one looked kind of timeless, but this one looks super dated. Yeah.

134
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:09,890
Like, that's that's a pretty big.

135
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:26,830
Yeah. This we're pretty much different right now. So for notable appearances, we don't really have any no of all appearances is, we've got donald in the nephews and then a couple of one off characters, the the grinder that we mentioned and Gin the monkey and the the sp.

136
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:27,970
So

137
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:36,585
let's go ahead go through the story itself So at the beginning of too many pets,

138
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:39,965
we've got Donald on a classic rampage page.

139
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:42,418
And I do think this is very Barks.

140
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:52,994
We'll see a lot of this. You know, he is he's in spring cleaning mode or something, and he is venting and raging at all of the Nephews pets

141
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:54,350
that are

142
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,600
coming out his his cleaning.

143
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,800
Yeah. Wonder that there's gonna head there. We just see them we've seen them in the panels. Any references.

144
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:12,415
So it's like yeah. I think it bad? Yeah. We've got puppies and Ducktales and a frog and a canary or some and a cat.

145
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,030
Yeah. He's... I I kind of understand where he's coming from. It definitely is too many pets.

146
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,510
So on on the next page,

147
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:23,705
Donald gives them an ultimatum. He says...

148
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:27,585
Well, not even them. He dictates that they're getting rid of the pets.

149
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:31,413
He is giving them all to something called the pet society.

150
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:35,242
They're they're asking are we never gonna be allowed to have pets?

151
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,622
He tells them no, and he gives them a pretty specific but broad statement

152
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:46,087
that, no. Not unless it's something different and he he gives Al list of all the common

153
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:54,072
pets, you might have no more cats dogs, Barks, frogs, bugs, ants mice bats, fish, or reptile, conveniently,

154
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,602
leaving out monkeys.

155
00:11:56,098 --> 00:12:11,424
And indeed. I just I love just make the kids because it's so tricky kids. They will get everything you're saying your tinted. Get my meeting and they. No. This one what you said, and you didn't say this. That's right. Ignore everything else. Kids are good and more Barks.

156
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:11,543
Yeah.

157
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,933
I So Donald,

158
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:20,958
in the next page, Donald goes back in the house and he gets ready to take a soothing bath. He reflects on

159
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:26,721
on what he said and considers whether. He was too harsh.

160
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:33,799
But just as he gets into the bath, or is about to their fraud that they miss jumps into his robe

161
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:35,195
and

162
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:36,950
upset him again

163
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:42,069
and the last panel on this page, we see him cutting a which,

164
00:12:43,248 --> 00:12:47,224
an old tree branch that they would called a switch to get ready to...

165
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:52,433
And it's it's a pretty funny panel. He says I'll make it up to them now.

166
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:53,512
But

167
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,070
that's definitely

168
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:57,068
a sign of the times.

169
00:12:57,766 --> 00:12:58,626
Alright. What

170
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:07,322
Yeah. And and again, I don't know about you, but this was a very common depiction. I saw this comics and cartoons all the time.

171
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:08,341
And

172
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:11,352
you would not see this today. This would

173
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,348
would definitely be viewed as abusive.

174
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:15,366
Yeah.

175
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:17,080
The f user

176
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,080
downtown

177
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,360
looking very for

178
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,090
and they come across an or and grind with a monkey.

179
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:31,480
And I gotta say the monkey really cute. It's I think a nice little bit of art design

180
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:34,993
we we hear the Oregon grinder

181
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:40,781
is talking in very stereotype to accent to Al saying he likes kids,

182
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,195
And and they really appreciate his fro king

183
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:48,890
and they wish out loud that they could have a pet like him.

184
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:57,024
And at that point, the Oregon grinder turns around and we get a good look at him, and he is just the the most Disney

185
00:13:58,242 --> 00:13:59,301
Italian stereotype.

186
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,859
Yeah. Yes.

187
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:05,095
Yeah. That you could imagine. And he offers

188
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:05,910
to...

189
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,790
He offers to give them the monkey. And

190
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,165
that's so in this conference like, yeah. That's

191
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:25,230
dated, but knowing this time like i see where it going Yeah. This was just shorthand for. This is in Italian. Yeah. I I get a kick out this as as half Italian myself. So I really appreciate

192
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,270
stereotype

193
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,790
depictions of

194
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:31,681
of my people in media because it's usually

195
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,797
it's usually a lot more gentle than than

196
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:35,850
many groups

197
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,490
get it. Sure.

198
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:45,260
So the nephews start to pull their money, but he explains that. No huge he doesn't mean to sell

199
00:14:45,637 --> 00:14:49,365
Gen go that he would like to give Jingle go away to them,

200
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,876
because he just really wants a good home

201
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,950
because he got drafted that same day. Okay.

202
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:05,665
Yeah. And and this was really striking to me because in most Barks stories even during this area, you don't really see like a direct mention

203
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,125
of the war.

204
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,520
Right that's not say there are none of them but

205
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,491
it's not it's not very common at all to to to see the war in true like that.

206
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:27,366
And then before he gives them Jane, he does warn them about Jin one live Barks if you put your hands

207
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:30,562
behind your head in kind of the universal

208
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:32,040
relaxing posture,

209
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:44,265
He gets enraged and he throws whatever he can get at you. That's not for sure. Oh, No. Not at all. And they'll make sure to to go back to this to to make sure we remember this, a couple of times.

210
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:48,815
You know, this is that kind of convenient plot device that.

211
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:55,045
You know, we don't we're not supposed to question. This just kinda moves moves the story forward.

212
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:56,105
So

213
00:15:56,565 --> 00:16:01,080
data work it does. It does. And I like Gen. He's cute.

214
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,800
Alright. So on the next page, the Nephews are bringing

215
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,142
Jin go back to... And and they're debating how they're gonna break the news to their uncle.

216
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,848
And they seem with that dreaded switch in his hand.

217
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:22,304
And and they plan to send jin go ahead to kind of

218
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,065
sue him ahead of time and make him more open to

219
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:27,385
So

220
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:42,550
Jin rings the bell, the Oregon grinder has explained to them how smart he is he understands almost everything you say. So they give him the instructions to go ring the bell, and he presents donald with an apple. And again,

221
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:47,470
for reasons of plot, Donald thinks that he's a oh boy, a little boy instead

222
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:51,641
obviously is a month. And so Donald accepts the apple.

223
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,293
I also like that, you know, during this, like, post depression era and,

224
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:04,405
you know, war scarcity era, apples are a treat. Right? That's something else that I see in in media from this time.

225
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,319
And so Donald

226
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,408
charleston the one realizes that was a monkey.

227
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:10,446
He

228
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:15,415
goes to look for the monkey and while he's distracted to the nephews bring him in, and they have

229
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:21,700
jingle served donald a nice tray of treats of, milk and donuts, I think.

230
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:24,170
Oh, I like this part where

231
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:26,765
Gen go goes and

232
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:28,482
starts a record,

233
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:33,850
because that was kind of a treat seeing an old the phone photograph and Donald record collection.

234
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:37,765
Yeah. It looks like this version of Donald got a pretty nice

235
00:17:38,105 --> 00:17:38,905
pretty nice setup.

236
00:17:39,945 --> 00:17:40,025
Yeah.

237
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:45,300
I kind curious, but that that an actual side that they just made it up. One on the

238
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,280
that panels.

239
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,155
I I definitely Google it and it's definitely not a real.

240
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:53,595
But it is Donald favorite. So...

241
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:59,088
So I guess that... That's Canon. Right? We've just identified Donald Inducks favorites. So on and

242
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:18,116
one of us needs to update the wikipedia page. Yeah. So the Nephews catch donald pondering out loud. This monkey is so health. They rules lawyer donald into a green to keep changing lot flash bubble. Yeah. Exactly. They are celebrating that they get to keep jingle go. Donald

243
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:30,800
tells them, hey, stop celebrating. You need to go do your chores. There's some cans that need to be thrown into the salvage box and again, I I think that might be a reference to wartime

244
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,600
scarcity. Right? How go get the cans to the.

245
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,360
So the nephews are painstakingly

246
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,294
throwing the cans and they get the right idea

247
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:43,650
to use Jin goes quirk

248
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:45,009
to have him

249
00:18:45,388 --> 00:19:03,911
throw the cans at them while they're sitting in the salvage box. Yes. I like have a k. I just remembered something that's reinforce that hot device. Dawn all is exercise on the other side of the window in a way that is kinda reminiscent of doing that. And then have are too late to stop Jingle from

250
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:11,024
checking a can through the window and being donald on the head donald is upset, of course, and he

251
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:15,983
demands to know who threw it. All of the nephews take the lane Instant.

252
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,245
The Nephews get ready to take their punishment from that switch.

253
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:30,227
They tell donald Al that they wanna set example for Jingle, That's why they fast up so quickly. And Gen, our Donald orders jingle go to do the

254
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:31,105
spanking.

255
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:34,950
But Jingle refuses is he breaks the

256
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:40,435
he breaks the switch over his knee, sending donald into a range. And then on the next page,

257
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,622
It's basically a sequence where Jingle has

258
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,738
gone missing in the house,

259
00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:47,736
and he's

260
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,692
causing some chaos.

261
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:52,105
Breaking a jam jar,

262
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:54,745
messing up mcdonald's kitchen

263
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:58,559
That continues on the next page. There's more chaos.

264
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:01,795
We're just supposed to get the idea here that

265
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:06,570
Jin is causing a huge mess in Donald clean house.

266
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:08,539
Yeah.

267
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:13,984
I I understand that they will do sometimes what they see

268
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:29,053
So eventually, he falls in the garage. He lights on a very cool looking old fashioned lawn mower and i like... I like seeing donald crying over his tulip lips his hands these his rare Severino bloom hypo dura.

269
00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:32,998
Should you

270
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,210
I didn't Google that one. I'm guessing it's not.

271
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,210
I I I I checked

272
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,985
never bloom, that's just great. Right? Like

273
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,178
That's genuinely. We've got the consequences.

274
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:48,172
Donald is furious,

275
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:55,009
and he says you've got to get rid of that. Month. He tells them they can't even come back into the house until they've figured out.

276
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,562
Oh you know what to do with him. And that's

277
00:20:58,034 --> 00:21:01,685
definitely old fashioned. You're not gonna kick your kids out of the house, I hope

278
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:05,929
They realized that they can't even go back in the house for their coats,

279
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:07,963
so they order gen

280
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,676
to go in through the attic,

281
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:14,400
and i'm Serious man is watching

282
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:18,426
while they give him these instruction yeah I do know that first panel

283
00:21:19,322 --> 00:21:22,030
dog is too hard to speak. Jingle.

284
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:22,528
Yeah.

285
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:25,025
But yeah. He was also

286
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:35,826
wanting ding to like the boys, who's exactly was thinking, which is just I love the right. I would they convenient from the writing. Child abuse, not animal if abuse, I guess. Yeah.

287
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:38,692
Right. This this mysterious

288
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:39,528
guy

289
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:43,845
who, you know, he's he's very creepy looking, but he's also very engineer.

290
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:47,394
We we just had a couple of podcasts where

291
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,387
some version of Pete

292
00:21:49,803 --> 00:21:57,233
was the villain. Right? The one that you purchased paid in. He was called black pete. And then the one that Ryan was on, the mum ring.

293
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:00,405
U. It was there was a black peed look alike

294
00:22:00,742 --> 00:22:06,481
in that one. Think again, old Disney have at s hard. But this guy is just kind of generic sinister.

295
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:20,475
And he notes that the monkey responds to commands and he wants to the monkey. And the nephews are outraged. They don't want Donald to sell him, but he goes through with it and the nephew are

296
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,135
left to cry.

297
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:29,210
We we learn on the next page what the man's purpose for Jin is. He is near a factory

298
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,090
complex, and we see him

299
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,610
on on the phone, again, a very old school

300
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,950
style phone.

301
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:43,385
Talking to someone about leaving some plans near the window. He's using Jin to

302
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:47,197
to steal some plants. So he's up and very

303
00:22:47,974 --> 00:22:48,474
military.

304
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:57,750
Yes. No doubt. He gives him the directions to go in through the window and take the plans. But before he can return him to the window washer station

305
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:02,221
that the spy is that, Gen starts to miss the nephews

306
00:23:03,078 --> 00:23:05,588
and the spy sees jingle

307
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:22,086
go in the direction and figures that he's returning to the. Goes like, oh, I missed those boys. I spent an hour away I wanna that them. Yeah. Very very convenient, but they had a great time together. Right? So Sure. So Jin comes back to the net use with the plans,

308
00:23:22,423 --> 00:23:30,273
but they don't realize what it is. They just know that it's thick paper that seems perfect for an for making paper airplanes.

309
00:23:30,771 --> 00:23:34,304
And I I thought it was a sign of the times that they were imagining,

310
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:39,470
you know, mine's a p forty seven. Mine's a torpedo bummer. Clearly

311
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:46,510
right out of the war. And then hue puts a pin on the nose of one so it'll stick stick up to things. And he let's

312
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:56,346
throw it. Which, you know, predictably it lands right Donald, but before Donald can get mad, he realizes what the papers

313
00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:06,788
the documents are, and he becomes very scared. And I can't remember if we've already seen that the plans are for something called a bomb sight, but at some point,

314
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:13,408
they mentioned that that's what the plans are for. And that wasn't the term that I was familiar with. I assume it's like a precursor

315
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,960
to radar or something. But... Well, in my in my extensive,

316
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,160
watching up old over two Movies.

317
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,306
No. Bomb size you know, it's for the bummer. So you wanna able to get an accurate picture

318
00:24:25,683 --> 00:24:30,171
where your droppings with being that high elevation. It's not so much a sensor like a radar

319
00:24:30,548 --> 00:24:32,300
but it's just Al location,

320
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:39,575
have the notification device of how to get a better clearer shot rather where your boss you're gonna go, so you can be more

321
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:40,734
like

322
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,990
screen or something like that. Yeah.

323
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:52,254
With the privilege of the plumbing World two, it gets the bomb size we used a lot as the

324
00:24:52,752 --> 00:25:01,945
military, but, you know, design become and. Yeah. Because obviously, at this time, if they didn't know about, you know, the the med manhattan project. So it's just

325
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:06,118
what could something general public be familiar with Right

326
00:25:06,457 --> 00:25:09,274
something did no. Yeah. I'm sure if you're you're

327
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:10,093
later.

328
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:17,125
Just a few years later these plans would have and having to do with the with nuclear weapons. Notes. So Donald

329
00:25:17,665 --> 00:25:20,545
tells them to hide the plans and he's gonna go after the call.

330
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:35,295
I guess he doesn't have a phone at home because he leaves them. And on the next page, they've just hidden the plans under the bed when they get knock at the door. And and it is the spy, and he demands. He doesn't... He says he doesn't care about the monkey.

331
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:39,949
Du monk as he calls him. He just cares about the plans

332
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:55,675
and the nephews. The nephews start to stall him. She barge in, and he grabs them, and he he ties them up, and this is, you know, kind of kinda disturbing. Right? Because he gives him like a tickle torture, and then he

333
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,730
escalate to

334
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,290
his other method, which is to tie candles

335
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,024
to their feet and let the camel

336
00:26:04,402 --> 00:26:05,081
run down.

337
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,573
So while he's waiting for them to talk,

338
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:12,127
he leans back in the classic

339
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:13,858
relaxation costs for.

340
00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:15,590
And, of course.

341
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:18,322
Yeah. We've got Gen who

342
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,005
does what Jingle does best

343
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:24,501
and he brains the guy with a base.

344
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,440
And

345
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:32,270
I mean, this is this is a funny animal comics, so it just knocks him out. But in real world, that that guy's dead.

346
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:40,462
Yeah. So Jin save the day, and on the last page Donald couldn't be more pleased. He's beam,

347
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,699
and he

348
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:52,374
he leans back to enjoy, you know, the end of a busy day and he puts his behind. Has had and brings him with the coconut.

349
00:26:52,751 --> 00:27:02,650
And the comic ends with the nephew trying to fan him awake and and saying, oh, yeah. We we should probably remember to tell him about that. And that

350
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,610
is

351
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:16,490
too many pets Any any kind of initial thoughts you have about this one here. Well, really it I can it's a very stuck and hear you talk about how... So we start

352
00:27:17,107 --> 00:27:19,815
with the finish. I think definitely only see that

353
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,517
that... Okay. This is tory I have to go with it here's the plot. It feels very

354
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:34,668
generic, you know, they're plugged in Al lots of different people. Not this you need it makes feel like it's a unique now or Inducks, I mean, maybe didn't be angry.

355
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:37,745
Right. But even but even though when he

356
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,981
found the plan, typically was dog gets angry.

357
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:43,829
Stays hot

358
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:46,940
but it's a good. I mean, definitely

359
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,867
Al example of this time. I'm not say bad I mean,

360
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,740
it's it's there

361
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,740
growth when was made.

362
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:11,509
It's seems very fitting. And, you know, the military you're saying in the aspect of it is the odd, but I definitely see what you're saying but this was the subject venture in a in a comment because feels like Al second extension now one like Al guys too. That's

363
00:28:12,486 --> 00:28:14,822
box picture this one. Yeah. There there's a

364
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:16,915
and normal story.

365
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:23,450
Yeah. There's definitely a reason that they put the money ring first. You know, that was obviously a labor love

366
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:27,836
for Bark, and the first one we you got to really do everything

367
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:33,632
himself. I agree with you. This one feels very, like, familiar are and its pacing.

368
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:35,983
You know, I kinda like how it starts out.

369
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,697
A little bit wacky.

370
00:28:38,432 --> 00:28:47,140
I think one of the reasons that it's nice that we get to include this even though it's not my favorite is that it... It's almost a stand for those ten pages.

371
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:50,035
You know, because there are so many of them. And,

372
00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:53,875
you know, the album that I read this in that collected this one,

373
00:28:54,335 --> 00:29:02,442
it they included several other of the pet stories because Barb went back to this kind of well a alone yeah. And they were.

374
00:29:02,861 --> 00:29:04,060
They were great.

375
00:29:04,594 --> 00:29:05,094
Like

376
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:09,617
the the three or four other stories in this. I enjoyed them so much more.

377
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:15,240
Even though they were quote just ten pager, just god's stories. But...

378
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,040
But some of those gag stories are

379
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,930
just wonderfully written and and very funny some amazing art. So,

380
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:30,476
you know, I I don't wanna dump on this one too much because again, he was working within the limitation of of a story that was already developed

381
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:31,354
and

382
00:29:31,851 --> 00:29:45,675
what I saying that yeah. We're just saying... He's done better and it just feels Like not dispatch work, and that's fine. Yeah. Yeah. There was not not too much that stood out to this one. And again, like other stories

383
00:29:46,189 --> 00:29:52,154
that we're next to it. We're much more enjoyable to. I took a look, of course, as we always do

384
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,860
Al at the web page Inducks

385
00:29:55,338 --> 00:29:58,031
that is the, you know, aggregation page

386
00:29:58,926 --> 00:29:59,426
for

387
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:06,023
user submitted reviews and this one had a a rating of seven point one

388
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:09,695
out of over forty thousand reviews

389
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:12,185
it or

390
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:16,505
out of forty thousand some comic stories rather, it was

391
00:30:16,845 --> 00:30:20,278
ranked one thousand nine hundred and seventy one.

392
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:28,594
And those numbers don't mean too much on their own. So just for a perspective, you know, you and I did high. That one had a rating seven point three.

393
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:31,431
And then

394
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:36,205
Ryan and I did the money ring, which is a seven point six.

395
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,560
If you look at those stories kind of within

396
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,400
all of the comics, they're compared to pirate gold was in the top

397
00:30:45,592 --> 00:30:49,282
was was rated higher than ninety eight point four

398
00:30:50,856 --> 00:30:59,629
percent of all the stories. And money ring was rated higher than nine nine point three percent. So that one's, you know, very highly rated.

399
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:02,835
This one is is in the top ninety

400
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:07,575
fifth percent I guess the top fifth percentile. So, you know, it's Barks,

401
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:19,763
so it's well regarded, but it's down definitely not rated as highly as those other ones. Okay As far as how it holds up, I did think it was really interesting

402
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:21,161
to

403
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,916
get to read this one and and really see a lot of

404
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,890
what was contemporary at that time, you know, see some of those things like the Oregon grind

405
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:37,261
and the the references to the world two planes and the casual corporate pro punishment.

406
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,277
So that that's always interesting to see.

407
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,110
We talk about

408
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:44,947
appearances in other media. Obviously,

409
00:31:45,326 --> 00:31:56,219
as is fitting for a comment that's, you know, not nearly one of his popular ones, this is one that's really been adapted. It's it's been reprinted a few times of course, not as much as some of the others.

410
00:31:56,916 --> 00:32:01,230
Barks never did any of his oil paintings or lit the graphs,

411
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:09,328
featuring this and my knowledge, there was nothing referencing this in any of the Ducktales

412
00:32:09,368 --> 00:32:10,346
I can't I

413
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:28,338
was. But as I mentioned, you know, Barks, this was the first of his pet stories, which he went back to a lot, and he did some great stories featuring those. Sure. I I like to talk about what there is you know, in terms of educational Al, Some of these stories have some interesting things that we might learn about.

414
00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:29,915
History or mythology

415
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:30,792
or,

416
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:32,268
you know, geography,

417
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:38,466
Didn't really take anything too interesting to this one. You know, by by nature, it's not one of the bark sort of

418
00:32:38,804 --> 00:32:52,298
travel log ones. No. So it doesn't really have that gone But again, I don't wanna dump on this one too much. It's still no it's a Barks story and it's still still very worth reading and and a very worthwhile. Yes.

419
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:56,804
So, Eric, do you have any other thoughts

420
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:59,321
regarding too many pets.

421
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:08,246
Well, like you're saying, this obviously, there's the little or any what meetings based on this that up this story, and I have to

422
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:13,434
really agree again, like obviously because there's not really any that Severino.

423
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:17,090
Background those white type of shots that he uses

424
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:25,926
whether it's the transitioning from, you know, from the ship to the c. I could get, you know, where the ship is see where we I could get on the five powered gold.

425
00:33:27,062 --> 00:33:30,411
But there were a couple and you're just, but I I appreciate.

426
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:34,003
And that is what there that you're looking Al is

427
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:36,695
the user a couple of users that, I think once your first.

428
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,330
Is the shadow

429
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:44,490
of the person in the ford Right shadow and the transcription or four the in the background pc color

430
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:48,020
just to give it that this is which we're on in the.

431
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:52,806
Using them completely shadow we doesn't have to do that very

432
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:54,321
a pretty good

433
00:33:55,058 --> 00:34:03,894
contracts what's on Yeah. The same. And then there's another on where is. You have to voice up the window and donald all and dark.

434
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:08,763
And they anybody talking and then live the system the boys and the reaction, I think.

435
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:11,676
And it's just it's a very neat to see that

436
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:15,318
That's not kind stuff. It's Generally you reviews Inducks economic

437
00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:17,390
for kid's audience

438
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,161
get pounds that I really enjoyed.

439
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:25,335
Was one when they're were all three boys were looking like. Okay. Gotta get the style

440
00:34:25,752 --> 00:34:27,009
box. I appreciate your.

441
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:39,210
And they're always over the head and I heard the row, that's all the same. And Gin is right there with them. But he's one of the cruel. Yeah. That was cool. Just perfectly seems like, okay. What we doing guys she's in on it.

442
00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:41,207
And and then

443
00:34:42,105 --> 00:34:44,978
as I thought that was were with and and then the same where

444
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,455
Jingle is breaking the switch.

445
00:34:47,874 --> 00:34:54,657
Oh, yeah. Where cracks his. He's very expressive that our in everything that's very much to.

446
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:56,212
This is a.

447
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,643
He recognizes what's going on.

448
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,255
He's not gonna do it.

449
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:05,836
And he's not about it. Yeah. You're right about the expression on this face. And I'm

450
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:07,171
That was really good.

451
00:35:08,223 --> 00:35:09,282
Yeah. Agreed.

452
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:16,600
And I'm I'm glad that you remembered I had asked you to mention your favorites panel and I forgot to introduce that but

453
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:23,455
that's funny because you you mentioned two of the ones that I had thought of, which that that switch making

454
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:31,655
seen definitely a panel definitely stuck out to me But the long panel that is on I think it's on page

455
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:36,105
nineteen or so, but the one where the nephews are waving goodbye

456
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,261
to, it shows them looking for lauren

457
00:35:39,774 --> 00:35:44,558
jin waving back, Donald looking pleased to over the the hedge.

458
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,689
That that one has it's just a really cool

459
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:50,936
panel really sums up, I think, the story.

460
00:35:51,793 --> 00:36:10,369
Yeah. And it kinda shows, you know, Donald kind of a bit of a villain. Not not maybe a bad guy, but he's definitely not a great... He's not a very positive character in this one. I think that's part of why I don't really care for this one compared for a lot of them. And we see this more in some of the earlier ones where that's a little bit more of his

461
00:36:10,825 --> 00:36:12,735
characterization. Yeah. So

462
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:15,850
thank you very much. I I always like talking.

463
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:17,568
I love talking du.

464
00:36:18,586 --> 00:36:28,210
You know, I told mine last week that it's so nice to get the chance to talk about these in real life because, you know, apart from you growing up, This was the thing that I was just hugely into.

465
00:36:28,805 --> 00:36:38,912
But it always felt weird being, you know, a teenager who really likes duck stories, and I couldn't really talk about much in real life. So I'm I'm gonna make a.

466
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:41,064
I'm gonna make up for last time.

467
00:36:41,601 --> 00:36:43,815
The next podcast that we do

468
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:49,931
is kind of getting back to the adventure mode, and it is the story frozen

469
00:36:50,268 --> 00:36:50,707
gold,

470
00:36:51,305 --> 00:36:54,456
which I haven't read in many years, so I'm excited.

471
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,366
To revisit that. Well, I forgot to mention

this episode and last that I looked up the upper value of this comment, you know, this count for last up. So two. So there was... There's one documented

473
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,545
sale of a nine point o condition, which would be like,

474
00:37:11,305 --> 00:37:12,145
really near mix.

475
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:28,959
Yeah. In in November of two thousand eight, that's sold for twenty thousand dollar. Lower range, you know, I assume most of them are one point o would be two hundred dollars. So Sure. This one's pretty highly valued because it's got two full length Barks stories and ten pager

476
00:37:29,534 --> 00:37:39,017
and as, you know, but it's mainly valued, of course for the money. Alright. Well, Eric, thank you again for joining me and I look forward to having me back soon.

477
00:37:39,673 --> 00:37:40,612
Yeah. My pleasure.
