1
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:08,695
we

2
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:29,958
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks, the podcast. Where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks, creator of sc Mc and writer and artist of the greatest Don and Scrooge comics of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological

3
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:36,770
publishing order. Hello. I am Barks Sever, a grown man who enjoys Donald Duck comics,

4
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:54,216
and I am joined by my guess another grown man who gets to take the role of Carl Barks newbie. Hello, i'm Ryan Bailey. Excellent. Welcome back. You haven't been scared off? Not yet. I was telling you beforehand that I'm super excited for this

5
00:00:54,794 --> 00:01:02,333
story that we're doing today. Comment is called the mystery of the swamp. And this one is a personal favorite of mine.

6
00:01:02,672 --> 00:01:07,417
It is kind of a bonkers story. Yes. I would I would agree with that. Al little bit of background

7
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:24,296
about this story and mystery of the swamp. Was published. It had a release date of January nineteen forty five. This one appeared in four color number sixty two, which is the same comic that you and I were doing last episode

8
00:01:24,648 --> 00:01:42,138
because this was the b comment that came after frozen gold. This is something that is very rare. We won't get a lot of comments that release two full lengths stories. So this was all in one... This would have been one issue that someone bought at the new stand. Yeah. Exactly. Gottfredson

9
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:42,718
gold.

10
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:46,167
That one had cover art for it.

11
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:54,511
And then mystery of the swamp never didn't have its own cover art originally. Any any cover are would have been done later on.

12
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,305
So this Al that's a lot of comic for your Nickel. Yes. Yeah. Exactly.

13
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:06,612
I think it was a dime at that point. You know inflation. Yeah. This one is twenty four pages in length

14
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:09,145
about average for bark. And

15
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,465
this is the first

16
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:14,985
of what's gonna be many stories where

17
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,058
Donald and the other Ducktales

18
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:18,638
encounter

19
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:19,754
a hidden

20
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:20,831
civilization

21
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:23,622
of lost creatures, basically.

22
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:27,863
So this one is is kind of gonna set templates. For

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,574
several stories, many of which are

24
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:33,723
beloved by fans and and very famous.

25
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:41,043
So synopsis of this one. This takes place in the ever glad, Donald from the nephews. They're gonna explore the blades

26
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:43,120
and encounter a

27
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:46,526
strange race, Al little creatures called the measles.

28
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,707
When you read this one ryan, were you pronouncing it to yourself as the measles or the?

29
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:56,156
I I

30
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:57,594
had the G silent.

31
00:02:57,973 --> 00:02:58,892
Al

32
00:02:58,932 --> 00:02:59,831
like, a new

33
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,667
right. Right. So when I was... When I read this for the first time in nineteen eighty seven,

34
00:03:06,123 --> 00:03:08,257
I definitely pronounced it

35
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,027
in my head as the,

36
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,977
but, you know, Have come to realize that, yeah, it's it's gotta be silent.

37
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:22,665
I mentioned that this one is personal one for me. This is one of the first, probably half a dozen comics I have around,

38
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:25,719
one of the very first Barks stories

39
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:34,523
that I ever read. I I read this one over and over. This one really wedded my interest in these

40
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:42,546
this template story. And a little bit a little bit of trivia about this, but it kinda sets that template. This is also

41
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,360
an example of something that Karl Marx did on occasion

42
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,129
where he would repeat a story that he did, he would basically

43
00:03:52,625 --> 00:04:04,400
rewrite it and use the same story beats in a different tail. And so Al little more than a decade later he is gonna do another story that's very familiar called land of the P Indians.

44
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,120
That one's probably

45
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,175
better regarded. He definitely did it kind of with different eyes in a different attitude.

46
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:17,900
But this one does hold a special place in my heart. Some of the other ones that kind of fit this

47
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:24,495
same template where they, you know, bum into a lost civilization, the very famous plane awful will story

48
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:33,135
lost in the andy land beneath the ground, probably a few more that I can't remember. So last time, I remember that you had mentioned

49
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:40,851
you mentioned something about the setting and how important how it seemed like Carl Marx really wanted an excuse to

50
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:42,622
set a story

51
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:51,780
somewhere and and just explore the setting and I like that. Because... Because I think that's definitely the case. You know, and this one, you can tell you really really wants to

52
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,699
draw the ever Gladstone really wants to explore the ever gl,

53
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,030
and they're very central to this story. Yeah. Definitely.

54
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:14,565
Yeah. The setting is a lot like frozen gold. It's a big part of what's going on. Right. You can tell because he really goes into a lot of detail with the art. And, you know, it's still a very cartoony, but it also looks like it has a lot of

55
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:15,765
more realistic

56
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:24,347
details. He didn't just draw what you felt like we're good swamp plans. I could tell that he was drawing from from a source.

57
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:30,130
I think that it helps to kind of treat the setting as almost an additional character in these.

58
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,742
And the ever Gladstone

59
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:39,315
me, this is, like where I learned about the ever glad for the first time. So I always viewed it as this imp

60
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:43,956
mysterious swamp. And it was kind of a bummer later on to learn that,

61
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:46,866
you know, the everett blades is a fragile

62
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:50,795
ecosystem that being over developed constantly.

63
00:05:51,495 --> 00:06:01,515
But a little bit about the place itself, this is the Wikipedia rabbit Al all that I went It is the largest sub tropical wilderness in the United States.

64
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:03,807
Contra Barks has depicted.

65
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:08,233
Today, you can view large portions of it on webcam.

66
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:10,710
It's being over developed constantly.

67
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:16,479
And I I found this interesting. The that blades themselves have never really been in avid,

68
00:06:16,857 --> 00:06:18,433
but a lot of tribes

69
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,660
historically lived around them and canoe through them constantly.

70
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:23,538
So

71
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:25,664
it is interesting to think that it's

72
00:06:26,242 --> 00:06:31,245
un lived if not une explored. And then Po say, dale leon

73
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,135
was mentioned in this story,

74
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:35,884
he did not really go

75
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,320
deep into the ever

76
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:40,570
from what I can tell, but, of course, he was in that area.

77
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:44,324
And did look for the the fable fountain of use.

78
00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:49,337
I also really liked learning that apparently, there's a ghost town within the Ever

79
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:54,526
called the lost city that throughout history was used either by native Americans

80
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:56,961
and or apparently Al capo

81
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,886
used it for a time is like the hideout out.

82
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,485
Notable appearances in this one, of course, are gonna be the measles themselves.

83
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:16,992
And then I don't I didn't know whether to count old nasty face. Since he's not really sanctioned, but but I'll mention him anyway. Nasty face, of course, also spelled with the silent g at the front. Yeah. I should've kept track of all the

84
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:19,929
all the different Gm words in this.

85
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:27,965
In and researching this one, I did find that Barks base this one off of... you know, he was inspired by no,

86
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:34,382
so that's why where the si g comes from. But I just I love that. That expectation.

87
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,221
And

88
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:43,585
it made it really fun to read every time the measles are speaking. But, yeah, let's let's get into the story itself. This

89
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:44,464
story

90
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,980
starts out with donald M and nephews.

91
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:49,592
On vacation

92
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:54,143
in in Southern Florida. You know, maybe this is the nice

93
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:01,341
warm vacation that they kept mentioning. They wanted to go to at the during during frozen gold.

94
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:05,131
I finally took their plan somewhere warm. Yeah. Exactly

95
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:10,093
So they're they're just fishing on a pier, but Donald is bored. And he

96
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:17,779
explains that he's planning to be he he's planning for adventure, he'd like to be in explorer, like the old time sailors.

97
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,592
And the nephews point out that there is nothing left to discover everything's been explored.

98
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,005
And, you know, Donald despair that and they're overheard by another fisherman on the dock.

99
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,036
And he motions

100
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:38,623
at the ever blades, and he says that, you know, there's thousands of

101
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:39,461
undiscovered

102
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,595
miles waiting to be discovered,

103
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:46,235
full of strange sites right here in our backyard and the ever blades.

104
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,807
Donald is is skeptical.

105
00:08:49,503 --> 00:08:50,003
But,

106
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,712
you know, this to me is really interesting because

107
00:08:54,328 --> 00:09:19,134
around this time, I think it's it's right at the end of when you could cr say that there's still these, like, undiscovered traps of the earth. You know, today, we have Google Maps, and we have satellites. And we pretty much know what's out there. But all this stuff was really in its infancy. So, like, I feel like these stories were more plausible and this is just

108
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:32,643
such a throwback to that sense of of discovery. That's why Indiana Jones movies to be set during this period instead of twenty twenty one. Yeah. Exactly. This this is the this is the age of adventure.

109
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:33,854
So

110
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:34,934
the Nephews

111
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:38,334
they mentioned that the ever place is the creep

112
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:43,549
swamp in the world. I've seen enough photos that I don't think it really looks that creepy,

113
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:57,285
but I'll give it to him. And the the fisherman eggs them on and he Donald says, sure. We'll do it. So they visit a thinly unveiled Macy's department store called Macy's in the comment, and

114
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,579
I'm Al un

115
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:02,939
wants to spring for the nicest camping gear.

116
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,231
And so they outfit themselves for this Ever adventure

117
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,586
And as they past the fishermen,

118
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:15,228
Donald again is really skeptical. He says, hey, I don't expect to see anything

119
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:16,664
impressive it Al all.

120
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:20,612
One thing I noticed on this page was

121
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:26,458
Donald Barks into and says, here, Clerk, outfit is for a comfortable tour of some sleepy lagoon.

122
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:28,395
But if you look even closer,

123
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:40,701
you can see the voice bubble is actually coming from the clerk. Yeah. It's just an error the nobody caught? Yeah. And I definitely caught that at age seven and it always weird me out and confused me. So...

124
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:53,134
Yeah. I'll have to look at the later re reprint and see if that's something they ever fixed. But, you know, I know there's a lot of, like, lettering errors and stuff that that never get corrected. And so I said suppose at some point it's like

125
00:10:53,913 --> 00:10:58,887
fossil and you don't wanna fix some of these errors? Yeah. It's part of the part of the artifact.

126
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:09,099
So Barks transitions them right into the swamp. He doesn't even, you know, spend any time on their first day, which I think gives you an idea

127
00:11:09,454 --> 00:11:18,096
of of what he's going for that they don't see anything interesting and they're just settling in for the night. They're they've taken up on one of those little islands

128
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:35,139
sitting little implants Barks. Yeah. And I I found this really appealing as a kid. You know, There's something about the idea of what your own tiny little personal islands that feels almost like a playground or something. So that was an aspect of the story I like. The idea this tent set up on this

129
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:43,330
island that doesn't look like it's more than a few hundred feet across. And so they're they're really enjoying themselves. This is more like a john t vacation

130
00:11:43,924 --> 00:11:44,424
And

131
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,944
as they put out the Fire and get ready for bed,

132
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:57,800
the Nephews comment on the need to lock up their camping gear, Donald slide now. We don't need to worry about that. We're way out here. There's no thieves.

133
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,879
Oh, I didn't mention that the nephews use comments

134
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:10,307
that they are deeper at this point in the swamp than any other person has ever been. So that added to me to the to the sense of fore.

135
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:18,144
The next morning, they wake up and they find out that their camp is almost completely bare. Everything

136
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:25,581
that they've set up has been stolen and all they out left is the tent and the boat. When Donald comes out with a shotgun to look around

137
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:38,012
by the time they turned back, their tent has also been mysteriously stolen. So this one is is setting it up really quickly that something mysterious is going on,

138
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:38,851
and

139
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,128
it's gonna get kind of progressively

140
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:43,825
more creepy and weird. Yeah.

141
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,339
It's interesting. There were no footprints either.

142
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,459
Yeah. Is like what sand?

143
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,559
Yeah. The nephews do comment.

144
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:58,620
So on the next page, they are searching on their little island for the thief. There's some really cool scenery some nice artwork

145
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:01,149
swamp plans. And an alligator.

146
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:05,949
They come back to their camp and they haven't found any sign of

147
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:11,123
anyone. But by the time they come back, they're sleeping bags are now missing as well.

148
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:12,641
Donald is

149
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,557
getting frustrated characters simply angry,

150
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:19,889
a comment that boat is now the only thing left

151
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,889
and

152
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:22,569
really nice gag

153
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:27,657
just at that moment, the boat starts to move seemingly under its own power.

154
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:37,120
Now we don't even have that. So they they grab onto the boat, but it's it's not the thief so they think it's just a a darn alligator.

155
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:39,311
You know, that's a pretty big alligator

156
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,024
to to be

157
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:50,057
not be scared at. Donald has seen everything by this point. He's so jade. He's just there's... you know, just one alligator, he used to wrestle five all the time.

158
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:55,029
Yeah. We're only a few stories in and and they're they're already pretty seasoned.

159
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:55,869
So

160
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:58,809
so they climb into their boat on the next page.

161
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:00,042
And

162
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:01,398
they

163
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,232
decide that they need to

164
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:04,547
explore

165
00:14:04,884 --> 00:14:05,384
and

166
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,504
investigate the different waterways to see if they can find something.

167
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,576
They use the the word...

168
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:17,014
I looked up how to pronounce this, but I've already forgotten it. It's Al flu, us.

169
00:14:17,474 --> 00:14:24,147
That's right. I keep wanting to say it is s in my head, but... That makes sense. Yeah. English is nonsense.

170
00:14:24,683 --> 00:14:34,449
Yeah. No. There's a there's a big slew right by my house. There's actually a couple of them. So your understanding of a slew is like a water way which thin within an existing

171
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:35,884
body of water.

172
00:14:36,341 --> 00:15:01,879
I'm not sure in what way it's not Al like a reef river or a creek because the the one here just looks like a river and we have people pad around and them and stuff and a lot of plant life and animals and stuff. So, yeah, I'm not sure what the what the distinguishing characteristic is. So this is where it starts to get pretty weird. The Nephews use our protests thing that they're going deeper, they're saying that this is really creepy.

173
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:11,569
They approach a tree that has a large sign on it. And Donald points outlook look. There's a sign up here. You know, And can't... There's not gonna be afraid of.

174
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:22,047
And the the tree is on a really cool looking mangrove. Or the sign excuse me is on a really cool looking mangrove tree. And when they approach, the sign ominous

175
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,005
says

176
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:24,841
beware of the measles.

177
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:28,608
And the kids asked on what measles,

178
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:32,879
but he's never heard of them, and he speculate

179
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:36,049
that it must be a gang of swamp kids.

180
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:37,889
So he's not deter

181
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:48,566
towards seem to... This would seem to contradict their earlier assessment that they had gone further into the swamp than anyone had ever gone before since there's a sign nailed to the tree.

182
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:53,299
Right. Right. And he pretty casually. He thought be swamp kits. But

183
00:15:53,879 --> 00:16:06,119
so they they come up to another sign. That's a follow that says you read that sign, Didn't you turn back Donald is not deter he is gonna keep going.

184
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,479
And at this point, his hat

185
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:10,999
struck off his head

186
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:12,939
by by an arrow.

187
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:20,556
And when they go to investigate, they still can't find any sign that there's anyone around. They don't see any tracks.

188
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:24,089
The only thing they see is another old alligator.

189
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:26,769
At this point, age seven,

190
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:27,809
I was

191
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:29,069
fascinated by Al.

192
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:37,917
So I watched more about them with the average kid. And they are being pretty casual around space like, twelve

193
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:38,833
ga.

194
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:41,304
But

195
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:44,452
once they give up searching on this little,

196
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:47,981
they get back in the boat and the alligator

197
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,378
looks at them with kind of a

198
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:51,256
suspect

199
00:16:51,715 --> 00:16:52,155
expression.

200
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:55,789
And we get our first glimpse of the measles

201
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:57,869
as we see

202
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:00,804
three pairs of feet

203
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:10,129
beneath the alligator. It's it's a a either dead Al or a costume or something that some little creatures have clearly been hiding

204
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:14,329
and we figured that that's how they've been getting around undetected.

205
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:18,529
I like to think that previous campers had come with

206
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:20,323
Al

207
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:32,123
life size alligator costume, and they they boosted it off those guys and and are using it now. Right. Because we'll we'll find out that they like to steal and collect things. So

208
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:34,633
we see the nephews continue

209
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,550
to

210
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,822
go in deeper into the swamp

211
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:46,047
and we get Al a neat perspective change at the bottom of this page where we see one of these creatures in silhouette.

212
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,500
At the top of a tree

213
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,280
pointing down at them with a really angry expression on his face.

214
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:57,945
And then it pulls back and we we actually hear from the measles

215
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:01,995
and they say pepper, the nose k measles,

216
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:05,579
And and so this is where we get our taste of

217
00:18:05,956 --> 00:18:07,054
their dialogue.

218
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:13,855
They're every word that they use the starts with end. They're gonna use Al a silent g,

219
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,335
like like the words Nash or nat

220
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:23,660
or no and they're gonna talk with kind of a hill bayou people accent.

221
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:31,934
And I really employers the... They have the kind of the standard like, Disney or big round nose, but then you can see their ears or kind of

222
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,249
thin like you would expect on like a dragon or some kind of prehistoric fish or something.

223
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,404
Yeah. Kind of a mysterious

224
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,757
critter to categorize.

225
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:53,476
Right. I I don't... They're definitely reminiscent of no, but they also look very unique and those, like, weird finn years. They kinda looked Al aquatic to me or something.

226
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:57,279
Yeah. I I really like on this page the different

227
00:18:57,616 --> 00:19:02,094
perspectives that we get because we see kind of a regular perspective of the Ducktales

228
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:08,529
Al ground level, and then we go up into that tree and we're angled almost straight down looking at the boat

229
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,125
and then we see the measles

230
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:19,164
up in their trees. I think it's really cool. Yeah. That's really good. Framing. It's very cinematic. It is and it...

231
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:21,664
Just the kind of the way that Barks

232
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:30,128
reveals a little bit more gradually as the is cool. So on the next page, the kids are ambushed

233
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:32,299
by a hail of aero fire.

234
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:36,324
Not to worry. These arrows are are all blunt

235
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:39,324
because they're meant to be warning shots. And

236
00:19:39,984 --> 00:19:49,486
Don and the kids see that the arrows are coming from the trees. They don't see anyone probably because the measles are so high and so small. As they approach

237
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,441
a an old log

238
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:56,534
that's, like, the Barks from old tree. They Donald is, like, let's

239
00:19:56,874 --> 00:20:05,524
use that to shield cell. And this works out really well and the measles yell at them, they yell to to go back and

240
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:19,203
We haven't had human creators in the land of the measles for a million years. And Donald Heels back and still doesn't think that there anything special. And then once the halo of arrows stops, they decide to take a peek.

241
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:20,622
So Donald

242
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:26,264
wants to look out one direction towards one bank and then after using gonna to look at the other.

243
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:30,746
And Donald is surprised when they lifted off to see a

244
00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:34,491
small village of hut on s.

245
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:44,649
And when he tells the nephews to take a look at it, the village has completely disappeared. So these these measles are really good at moving a lot of stuff

246
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:50,609
very quickly. I think it's also interesting at this point that Dom keeps making his comments, like these are

247
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:52,469
mischievous kids.

248
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:55,899
And so far we haven't actually seen anything to

249
00:20:56,996 --> 00:21:15,444
to show that they're not, like we can see out of the their feed out of the alligator costume coming out the bottom of the Al costume. Kinda look like little kids, and then then we see the little guy in the tree and all the other little guys and silhouette. Maybe this is just like a lord of the flies, gang of little kids, you know, Sure. Yeah. There's no reason to think otherwise. I mean, maybe the arrows.

250
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:18,424
So at this point, they

251
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:20,556
they continue on

252
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:26,892
there's a great gag here that really just needs to be red word for word. Donald says there's

253
00:21:27,644 --> 00:21:35,559
those houses didn't didn't just get up and run away. And then on the next panel, they see the house literally running away the still

254
00:21:36,816 --> 00:21:54,057
strips striving across the water and nephew say that Dickens they didn't. There they go running now. I I really like this part of the story where things are just getting... It feels like things are getting weirder and weirder as they go deeper and deeper into the swamp. Like, at this point, in the story anything

255
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,655
feels possible,

256
00:21:56,274 --> 00:22:01,743
like like what that fisherman at the dock was saying, you who knows what's in the I thought

257
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,259
the running

258
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:20,868
houses on s would be part of the mystery that would get had explained later, but it it never really did. So I'm still here on a subsequent reading. Not sure what's going on in this picture. Are there teams of people inside like like Rowe on an ancient Greek boat? I'm just picturing a bunch of measles

259
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,941
that, you know, they've got their drill. They they don't wanna be

260
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:32,722
discovered. So they've got some mechanism that's causing it to run along. But to me, it's just supposed to give a little bit more color as it's weird.

261
00:22:33,322 --> 00:22:46,049
We're in the swamp, we're we're in measles territory now. So Donald still doesn't take this seriously. He jumps out of the boat and he is going to to... He's pursuing them with a shotgun.

262
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:51,409
Before he has a chance to shoot their s off, the one of the measles

263
00:22:52,084 --> 00:23:05,101
calls out to fire at them not with blunt arrows, and Donald gets shot right in the which causes him to drop his shotgun and Barks shot peppers one of the measles,

264
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:11,901
and we get good look at him for the first time as do Donald and the kids

265
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,179
and they are staring on

266
00:23:14,598 --> 00:23:24,849
with just shock at these little creep critters that again look like no. They've got kind of a weird mix of clothing on. They look kinda like hill

267
00:23:25,426 --> 00:23:25,926
and

268
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:35,614
one of the measles who has a crown on tells them all to meet back tonight at a place called Me knob. Yeah. Yeah. We do... It is a very

269
00:23:36,169 --> 00:24:00,379
probably intentional parallel here on the two side by side frames of donald leap up and getting shot in the butt with an arrow and the nasal getting popped off of his there, getting shot in the butt by Mcdonald's Barks shop. Okay. You're right. They've got. They've got almost the same pose. It's drawn from the same angle. So On the next page, Donald and kids are speculating on on what the heck they are. And

270
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:23,754
Donald is puzzled, but he wants to follow them, and they don't they're not able to track the measles. So we transitioned to that night. The nephews user commenting on how scared they were of the shotgun because that's what caused all the measles to to break into the swamp. And later that night, they can hear some drumming from a waist off and they figured that it must be the measles

271
00:24:24,054 --> 00:24:25,394
having a war dance

272
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:33,364
And then nephews are freaked out, but Donald says, no. We can't leave. We might never be able to find this place again, and he's

273
00:24:34,063 --> 00:24:35,762
he's really determined

274
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,680
to get some evidence

275
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:44,138
and measles. Because again, you know, he explained at the beginning of this story that he really liked to me explorer.

276
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:47,923
So I guess that's why he's so determined

277
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,957
to to track him.

278
00:24:50,374 --> 00:24:56,113
And this is this... I mean, this is one of a few places in the story where I'm not sure what is motivating

279
00:24:56,572 --> 00:24:57,312
the characters.

280
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,908
I mean, it if he wants to discover things,

281
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:01,067
he has...

282
00:25:01,725 --> 00:25:09,399
You know what I mean? And he can he can leave, you know, they're obviously in some danger. They're in, you know, these people's territory,

283
00:25:09,993 --> 00:25:13,205
don't have any more supplies except for the boat that they took back from the.

284
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,196
Probably would've have been sensible to

285
00:25:16,653 --> 00:25:19,227
go back home or at least go back and resume your vacation.

286
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:25,479
Yeah. I think at this point, he's more motivated by his own stubborn or I'm gonna see

287
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:28,419
because you're right. There's not there's not a great reason.

288
00:25:28,954 --> 00:25:31,154
Behind this other than to advance the story.

289
00:25:31,674 --> 00:25:37,414
But i I think we see this in a lot of the earlier Barks stories where

290
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:43,024
that's that is kind of his motivation. So they they follow the noise

291
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:47,100
to what must be nasal knob when they're are kind of

292
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:49,510
sneaking up and approaching These.

293
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:54,317
It's it's really crazy because we can see the measles Barks

294
00:25:54,477 --> 00:25:55,336
square dancing

295
00:25:55,928 --> 00:25:57,983
and they're in front of a large

296
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,099
temple

297
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:04,642
that what we're about to discover has a large statue of, like, a nasal

298
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:22,039
deity or an nasal god of some kind. One of the weirdest scenes in any of the Barks stories I And the idol is on top of this kind of short want pyramid kind of aztec looking pyramid maybe maybe like a zig almost. And we focus on the king of the measles

299
00:26:22,593 --> 00:26:28,042
who is cha his people. And he's pointing at the idle.

300
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:45,978
Their deity is named the old nasty face. And he and treats nasty face to send the lightning bolt to wipe out the human creators and nasty face being Al large stone idle doesn't answer. And the measles they seem to have their...

301
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:51,186
Their religion seems to be pretty pretty consistent. If they don't hear anything

302
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:57,468
from him, it is evidence that he wants them to do the job them cells, but they're terrified

303
00:26:57,805 --> 00:27:04,777
of the shooter gun. And Donald and the kids over here the king say we gotta feed them to the alligator.

304
00:27:05,236 --> 00:27:20,776
But before that, they gotta continue their dance. When we transition back to Donald that and then Nephews use you know, they're like, well, of course, we gotta get out of here but Donald is pondering and he has what he describes is a devilish idea they they're gonna

305
00:27:21,353 --> 00:27:24,364
and need to take back to prove

306
00:27:24,741 --> 00:27:31,484
what we've seen. And I definitely got thoughts about turn, but I'm I'm sure you do. So

307
00:27:31,864 --> 00:27:33,004
what way do you think?

308
00:27:33,704 --> 00:27:36,924
He has gone completely crazy from

309
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,979
swamp guests. I'm going to assume or something has

310
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:48,154
affected his Ducktales mind. I'm surprised and Nephews went along with him this far, but but at this point they're doing willing to voice to their caretaker.

311
00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:52,554
Yes. This is this is crazy. We need to get out of here and get back to a real city

312
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:53,729
where they're not gonna

313
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:56,329
sacrifices to their giant statue.

314
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:01,209
Right. Yeah. So this this is admittedly a a pretty villainous

315
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,219
heel turn for Donald.

316
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:08,975
Even back then, I didn't like seeing this as much as I do really enjoy this story.

317
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:15,803
Barks, I think at this time is really finding the character, and I'm sure is really influenced by the old,

318
00:28:16,142 --> 00:28:17,800
you know, cartoons that

319
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:28,939
that he himself spent some time working on. So Donald is kind of, like an avatar for the kinda main character that he wants in these comics and

320
00:28:29,555 --> 00:28:35,380
sometimes he's gonna be a really noble every man and sometimes he's gonna be kind of jerk. And then this one, he's he's a jerk.

321
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:42,335
This is obviously a terrible idea. You know, there they're inter here. And he even uses the word kid kidnapped.

322
00:28:42,909 --> 00:29:01,393
So I I don't think there's any... He's not confused about what it is that he's trying to do. And and other reason this is uncomfortable is, like, the measles are... They're not humans. Right? But but they are humans. They're they're just little. They're they're talking. They're they have, like, society, their social there. So

323
00:29:01,851 --> 00:29:09,594
this is coming from a perspective that doesn't speak well of of Donald or attitudes at that time. And,

324
00:29:09,934 --> 00:29:14,414
you know, in some ways, this is kind of like an American perspective. Right? We're we're gonna go in.

325
00:29:15,028 --> 00:29:21,782
And we're gonna do what we want because we're right. He said, on the first page, he wanted to be like Columbus drake

326
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:34,769
You gotta bring back some specimens to show to to proper civilization. Right? Yeah. The savages that you find out in the out in the new world please. So so an uncomfortable part of the story, but

327
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:41,060
it definitely advances the plot. They are And in quick time, they encounter

328
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:42,257
a nasal

329
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:50,617
sleeping beneath the tree. They decide Donald decides that this is the guy, and they capturing him shockingly easily.

330
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:55,784
You know, I almost wondered if he is just pretending to be Al asleep there because they can

331
00:29:56,364 --> 00:30:01,184
bind and gag him without him waking up. They take him back to their boat. And

332
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:09,113
at this point, Dawn has broke and they are leaving, They're gonna try to not leave any kind of a trail for measles.

333
00:30:09,452 --> 00:30:09,952
But

334
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:18,349
we flashed the nasal who has woken up and with his feet has grabbed a bunch of grapes

335
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:19,679
and is

336
00:30:20,297 --> 00:30:20,797
depositing

337
00:30:21,294 --> 00:30:34,658
individual grapes in the water, leaving a a pretty ingenious trail that should be very easy for the measles to file. The grapes are are floating like on the surface of the water that leave like a like, a bread crumb kind of trail.

338
00:30:35,117 --> 00:30:36,576
Yeah. I... This

339
00:30:37,355 --> 00:30:39,586
this seemed very con to me.

340
00:30:40,244 --> 00:30:40,744
There's

341
00:30:41,082 --> 00:30:43,698
like, where on earth did those grapes just come from?

342
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:59,009
He... Like, you can see the panel before where they're carrying him from his sleeping spot. That's not like he had grapes on him when they grabbed him, and there's no grapes in the boat because there they've been stripped clean of everything except their boat. Sure. So he just suddenly has them. Maybe

343
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:10,097
maybe the grapes were already... You know, maybe there's a lunch in or some... Okay. I don't know. That that doesn't bother me the way that some of the other kind of villainous details in this.

344
00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:11,096
But...

345
00:31:11,475 --> 00:31:16,425
But I think that's a fair point. When I was a kid, I loved this. I thought this was such a neat

346
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:26,750
neat of of tracking. And Barks obviously, really liked it because he's gonna go back to this bit in that later comic that I had mentioned call land of the Big Indians. But...

347
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:31,444
Yeah. This is how they're gonna... They're gonna be caught and on the next page,

348
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:39,900
Donald feeling confident, so he takes off the measles gag and immediately and predictably, the nasal

349
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:43,394
calls out for help and they can hear...

350
00:31:43,774 --> 00:31:45,434
The name is Napoleon.

351
00:31:45,854 --> 00:31:49,054
They're... They've all got names that start with G.

352
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:59,874
And so his his fellow measles are not far behind. So they gag him again, Donald tells them they'd that row into the reeds and hide

353
00:32:00,492 --> 00:32:03,267
kind of in a a tough of tall reads.

354
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:06,779
But the nasal is very resourceful,

355
00:32:07,277 --> 00:32:11,826
especially with his feet. He grabs the shotgun done and bangs it against the boat.

356
00:32:12,485 --> 00:32:24,427
And so they're sure that they're gonna be trapped, but Donald is also very bright. And he tells them that they need to rapidly sync their boat and use some hollow reeds

357
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:26,004
to breathe through.

358
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:28,199
That's also very clever.

359
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:35,399
Right. Yeah. These these were all things that has a seven year old. They just seemed like the height of, you know, outdoor

360
00:32:36,392 --> 00:32:36,892
adventure

361
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:37,730
survival

362
00:32:38,187 --> 00:32:42,849
pursuit whatever to me. And and so we got a really cool panel next of

363
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:45,882
the Nephews and the captive nasal

364
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:46,719
breathing

365
00:32:47,136 --> 00:32:48,434
underwater through reeds

366
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:51,305
while the other measles are growing

367
00:32:51,683 --> 00:33:09,899
right over them. That I I like that panel Al lot. And so they're in the clear. However, the measles are now between them and the coast, so they don't think that they're gonna be able to speak past them. And the nephews have a good idea Al this point, they decide that they can use the reeds to disguise themselves as measles

368
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:22,624
which Donald describes is a r idea, which clearly, I don't think you can weave beards and fake hats in that span of time, which is what they do, but it makes for a cool visual

369
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:35,049
of seeing them disguised as measles And as they're rolling past, we have a moment where we think they've been discovered because the team calls out, but he's just giving them instructions to search and the slew and

370
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:37,609
they are very relieved. Yeah. I

371
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:38,609
I like

372
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:44,424
making the customs out of the reeds and just feels like the exact same category to me as the

373
00:33:45,364 --> 00:33:59,720
knockout out guard as you're trying to escape and then pull him into a, like a service closet and then one second later step out of the service closet wearing his clothes. It's a a standard trope... It's a classic. It's a classic for a reason. Yeah.

374
00:34:00,412 --> 00:34:03,303
So they've managed to get past them.

375
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:12,648
And Donald is a lookout on the tree. He sees that they've turned back. And he says it's it's safe now to make a cage for our little pet

376
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:20,754
are the words that he uses. And again, know, I I know the measles are fictional creatures, but this is this is obviously like, super Huey,

377
00:34:21,954 --> 00:34:27,909
on his part because can he... The need, like, has a name, it can speak.

378
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:29,269
So they

379
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:39,611
dance you can square down. It can grab it this pop on her and Scrooge below left. They they can make a pretty quick hat they can construct a wooden cage quickly.

380
00:34:40,466 --> 00:34:42,838
While they're doing it, they're talking about how

381
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:52,665
impressed people are gonna be when they see. You know, I noticed the nephews use his name. Right? They say when people see Napoleon, they're gonna gas and donald

382
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:59,261
calls him our little pet. So that's Al that's a contrast there to me. And

383
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:07,578
when they get him and the cage, they Donald removes the ropes. And we can see he's got a pretty sm look on his face and he he just falls over

384
00:35:08,077 --> 00:35:09,296
laughing up uproar.

385
00:35:10,129 --> 00:35:24,191
And he tells Donald that he's his butt as free because he is a swell. I'm sure you were as puzzled as donald was. But we're meant to take it literally because he says he can swell up and

386
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:31,959
he proceeds to do it. And I love... I love Donald line as he's watching it of all the screw sites

387
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:33,599
because you Napoleon

388
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:39,888
breaks through the cage. I'm glad that a sweater would have the foresight to always own

389
00:35:40,427 --> 00:35:42,285
stretchy pants. Just like

390
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:44,419
just like Bruce Banner

391
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:48,779
in my comics needs to have the stretchy as purple pants possible.

392
00:35:49,199 --> 00:36:03,939
Some some minor character just making a killing selling selling them to various characters around. Exactly. And And again, this is... This story is crazy. Right? Like, this is this is really odd. This is really weird.

393
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:16,297
I can't look at this with anything other than my seven year old eyes when I first read this and and just was delighted by this story. So I don't know. Maybe you're you're seeing this and it's just

394
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,463
too weird, but I love it. It works

395
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:24,170
great for me. And this is something that he's also gonna go back to

396
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:28,397
in what Lam beneath the ground, one of the characters

397
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:33,956
and that is gonna do something very similar to to deliver a message.

398
00:36:34,972 --> 00:36:39,780
So it's it's been fun to to see these things that he he likes to return to.

399
00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:41,798
Napoleon

400
00:36:42,137 --> 00:36:43,236
has just

401
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:45,474
left off this island

402
00:36:45,988 --> 00:36:52,793
and he's bounding across the water like like, a skip stone or, like, a beach ball or something. And

403
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,430
Donald is

404
00:36:54,863 --> 00:37:06,254
too stubborn here because he wants to catch... He refers to him as that free key is gonna fire a shot into the air to spare him so it'll stop. And it does scare him, but only

405
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:10,929
to hide into the brush and we transition to the other measles.

406
00:37:11,764 --> 00:37:15,423
Because they... They're hearing this shotgun as well. And

407
00:37:15,723 --> 00:37:19,699
now they're heading to intercept the Ducktales

408
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:26,939
Yeah. Still just donald is more concerned with bringing bringing the specimen back than any symbols they have of safety.

409
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:37,754
Alright. So they they lied on to the next island that he's gone to in pursuit. But by this time, the other measles have managed to station themselves in the trees,

410
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:41,504
and they catch donald in a basket.

411
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:48,578
And I like that it seemed a basket seems appropriate it seems like some some thought that Barks paid into

412
00:37:49,115 --> 00:37:49,615
what

413
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,739
their civilization would use. Right? And they've got all these river

414
00:37:53,117 --> 00:38:03,832
So... And they they h them up into the trees. Donald doesn't realize that he's up in the trees. So he starts to slice his way out the road. He would have noticed flipping upside down by this point, but

415
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:12,819
Right. Let's I still think he's sitting on the ground somewhere. Right. So by the time... By the time he busts his way out of the basket, he

416
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:16,730
he plummet to the ground where he is easily captured

417
00:38:17,163 --> 00:38:19,260
and they head Barks towards Me

418
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:20,636
with him bound.

419
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,812
He is wondering

420
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:32,299
what's become of the Nephews. He asked the the needle that's piling the boat and I like how the needs will just kinda casually jerk system

421
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:40,994
backwards and tells them to take a look and that behind you and and we see the Nephews user are tied up. Yeah. I think it's interesting that

422
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:46,081
the nasal up to this point have been, like, shooting arrows at him and trying to

423
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,964
cause him some harm. And now that he's been effectively or maybe literally not unconscious

424
00:38:51,782 --> 00:39:00,625
They're going to bring him back as a specimen know. That's right. So on the next page, we get a really good look Al me knob in the daylight. And

425
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:04,868
there's a big crowd of measles with the king on the base.

426
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:09,294
And it's interesting that the measles have kind of like a range of different

427
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,581
hats. And outfits

428
00:39:11,997 --> 00:39:17,529
from what looked like different civilizations throughout different eras. And we hear some crowd top

429
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:22,594
They talk about... Someone says that these are the first humans that

430
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:31,739
he's seen since po Lay from fifteen thirty team commentary about how measles go on forever. And so the king

431
00:39:32,315 --> 00:39:35,345
decree that the nephews user to be locked away in the Al.

432
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:42,596
Jail. I I was wondering if I was to interpret the the phrase first Huey, I've seen since Punt

433
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:50,889
was through here. He is saying what he sounds like he's saying that he personally saw po leon. Yeah. That go through there five hundred years ago. Yeah.

434
00:39:51,967 --> 00:40:02,233
Four hundred and thirty years ago at this Yeah. It seems like the measles are very long live. I was thinking you were gonna point out that they referred to the ducks as humans too I noticed that

435
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,070
on

436
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:11,065
the first or second page, the fishermen was saying, no no human has been back here, and I thought are are these characters humans?

437
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,599
Yeah.

438
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:20,895
And and they they are in in these stories, the docs and any of the sentient, the dog people, the mouse people,

439
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:22,491
they're just humans.

440
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:25,005
So that's something that we never really

441
00:40:25,478 --> 00:40:28,336
to my knowledge, there's never any point where a character

442
00:40:28,835 --> 00:40:34,642
points out. Oh, I'm duck, Huey, humanoid duck, and there a little animal Ducktales

443
00:40:34,562 --> 00:40:38,774
just hand there. That's who they are. So we learn a little bit about

444
00:40:39,152 --> 00:40:47,883
knees law, and Donald is gonna have the chance to get his freedom if he faces off against one... The measles champion.

445
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:53,677
They get led to, like, an outdoor arena and And this reminded me of the

446
00:40:54,013 --> 00:40:54,951
the, like, outdoor

447
00:40:55,806 --> 00:40:57,222
arenas that the

448
00:40:57,837 --> 00:40:58,629
the Maya

449
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:05,429
have that they looked real really reminiscent of it to me. He... I built the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. So

450
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,117
He needs the champ, no

451
00:41:08,654 --> 00:41:17,580
with si g as always donald is immediately skeptical because he's he's a pretty tiny will easily even he's super confident as Donald usually is.

452
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:22,681
But Donald figures out immediately that no thomas is also a swell

453
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:29,992
He is in his words, the swell swell that ever swelled. So I'm wondering why the measles would make this offer.

454
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:46,009
I it's possible that they're just one hundred percent confident of how this fight is going to go down and they just want some entertainment, but the prospect of a pardon as they put it where I guess Donald can go back home, that would be disastrous for these guys. They...

455
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:49,984
I think they've said by this point, or they're going to say later that they don't they don't wanna get,

456
00:41:50,837 --> 00:41:59,014
by assignments all the time. Yeah. They don't wanna get pest to that. Which which they absolutely would. Right? You're right. It would be catastrophe for

457
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,604
I agree I think they like the entertainment.

458
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,720
And

459
00:42:04,097 --> 00:42:10,119
I don't think they see that they could ever lose. And I'm guessing if they did, you know, they've got the advantage numbers.

460
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:30,345
I don't think... I don't think that offer freedom is really on the table, but No. Another possibility is the pardon doesn't include leaving. It just includes not being imprisoned. And. There you go. They can they can just fade into measles society, they can take up swelling. And any humans are gonna be dead in less than a hundred years anyway.

461
00:42:30,843 --> 00:42:32,759
Right. And yeah we'll move on eye.

462
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:37,629
Alright. So on the next page, we've got Donald battle against

463
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:38,588
no.

464
00:42:39,486 --> 00:42:41,124
It doesn't go well for Donald.

465
00:42:42,138 --> 00:42:43,317
The the measles

466
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:44,236
are

467
00:42:44,775 --> 00:42:47,952
very placid watching this. They know what's going on.

468
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:49,390
He they see no

469
00:42:50,182 --> 00:42:51,560
deflate as he comes down,

470
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:52,437
just

471
00:42:53,054 --> 00:42:57,023
squishing Donald, not gonna wind out of them. I noticed they called him No.

472
00:42:57,481 --> 00:43:02,025
Yeah. Like to think I like to think of the way we give our celebrities nickname.

473
00:43:02,442 --> 00:43:15,766
Well No. Yeah. So on the next page, Donald was days, and they set him up for the K cross, the ten strike. But anyway, he rolls himself like a bowling ball and

474
00:43:16,438 --> 00:43:18,412
sp donald onto a platform

475
00:43:19,147 --> 00:43:28,549
in a a lagoon watery pit with very sheer walls The king announces that he's failed when his freedom. It's time to get the Nephews.

476
00:43:29,285 --> 00:43:35,949
And Donald is about to fight bad when he realizes that the platform has been knocked onto is surrounded

477
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:41,529
by hungry Al. I noticed here he also says, I interpret this as a du sound. Work.

478
00:43:42,143 --> 00:43:45,316
Yes. That's what he claims as he looks down at the alligator.

479
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:51,437
Yeah. That lack expression is gonna come up a lot in the comics. Again, I don't even think about it, but

480
00:43:51,816 --> 00:43:56,609
du sound. And I guess that's one of the few times we kinda remember that these are ducks.

481
00:43:57,143 --> 00:44:00,201
So on the next page, we transitioned to the Nephews

482
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,877
who seemed to have been watching what's going on from their

483
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:07,406
cell of high. In the Zig.

484
00:44:08,821 --> 00:44:13,089
They're are pretty desperate. So they decide that they need to try and slip between the bars.

485
00:44:13,742 --> 00:44:20,577
Because there is a couple stories down another cell and so they they form a human chain

486
00:44:21,088 --> 00:44:25,338
and it's it's a pretty perilous and cool looking scene.

487
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:26,176
I

488
00:44:26,634 --> 00:44:32,220
felt it, you know, as a kid that very very dangerous and frightening, the the height that they're

489
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:36,869
trying to do this maneuver Al. So I... Listeners should be... Listeners should be picked

490
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:43,069
that mission impossible to scene where Tom cruise is climbing the outside of that

491
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:44,124
tower and

492
00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:45,242
And not.

493
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:48,691
Yeah. That's right. Yeah.

494
00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:51,199
Except it's, you know, eight year olds or

495
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,336
I drove these guys are.

496
00:44:53,895 --> 00:44:54,395
Exactly.

497
00:44:55,173 --> 00:45:00,959
And so they they do make it. Their human chain were they have access to the interior

498
00:45:01,377 --> 00:45:11,867
of the temple. They need to figure out some kind of strategy. Should they go exploring in the interior and they come across the measles like their treasure room, their spoils.

499
00:45:12,364 --> 00:45:20,024
And we can see a lot of different things from again, different areas difference. Civilizations, there's some made American stuff,

500
00:45:20,324 --> 00:45:22,744
like a mace suit of armor.

501
00:45:23,284 --> 00:45:23,784
And

502
00:45:24,084 --> 00:45:25,584
the camping gear

503
00:45:25,979 --> 00:45:29,099
the the Ducktales had along with their pho and records.

504
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:31,679
Huey, comments that the measles

505
00:45:32,499 --> 00:45:35,454
expect their idle to talk. And so they

506
00:45:35,874 --> 00:45:42,814
he says that they need to get that phone graph into the mouth. And so they head upstairs into the mouth of the aisle with the pho.

507
00:45:43,248 --> 00:45:49,979
And we transition out to the measles. The the king is informed that the legal have escaped have escaped.

508
00:45:51,194 --> 00:45:52,254
And the king

509
00:45:52,594 --> 00:45:58,908
is telling them that, you know, you gotta hunt them down or old nasty Barks gonna be awful matt. And then we

510
00:45:59,247 --> 00:46:02,183
transition into the island's mouth where we can see...

511
00:46:02,642 --> 00:46:18,140
See everything from a distance. They're setting up and they attach a ball of string to the starter switch so they can start it remotely. Yeah. I know the guy bringing the message the king has yet another style of hat that I think of as like a marching band hat

512
00:46:18,477 --> 00:46:20,651
right, which seems to imply that

513
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:27,855
someone else has been in the nasal civilization pretty recently. I'm assume of fort Lauderdale high school.

514
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:31,206
Marching band has lost their bad leader.

515
00:46:32,245 --> 00:46:33,104
Made the arrest.

516
00:46:34,442 --> 00:46:38,219
On the next page the king is directing them to find the nephews

517
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:53,450
But they they show up right behind him, very compliant, and he tells his subjects to throw him in the gator pool, but they remind him that he got asked the advice old nasty phase this next panel

518
00:46:53,962 --> 00:46:58,009
feels like the king is is playing a little bit of a con because he

519
00:46:58,426 --> 00:46:59,882
he he agrees

520
00:47:00,419 --> 00:47:04,288
and you can tell he doesn't expect old nasty face to say anything.

521
00:47:05,268 --> 00:47:07,328
So, you know, I I read this as

522
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:09,743
the king knows that

523
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:11,699
whole nasty faces

524
00:47:12,116 --> 00:47:12,616
is

525
00:47:12,994 --> 00:47:13,813
is bunk.

526
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:16,963
So the king and treats old nasty face,

527
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:23,478
what should they do and we transitioned to seeing Huey, pull that string behind his back.

528
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:35,974
And old nasty face appears to break into the song until tells them everybody dan, grab your partners and circle to the left. And the measles are all just

529
00:47:36,471 --> 00:47:42,049
snacks, their hats. There are many different hats playoff off their heads. Like the the universal

530
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:52,187
signal for alarm, which is your had shooting into the air. And and little surprise lines above your head. I I just love the visual

531
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:55,948
of this one with with Al nasty face

532
00:47:56,526 --> 00:47:58,222
being so ridiculous here.

533
00:47:59,236 --> 00:48:15,751
The the way that the way that Barks drew Al nasty face to me, like, he's he's not... He's he's a god like measles. Right? Because he's he's got horns. He's larger than life, but he's still not that giant measles knows. So it feels very lived in to me.

534
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:19,657
I agree. And and so the Nephews are able

535
00:48:19,994 --> 00:48:25,455
to help Donald. Escape they make it back to their boat and they very pre

536
00:48:25,873 --> 00:48:26,692
note that

537
00:48:27,229 --> 00:48:37,023
that someone's put a basket of apples in it and, you know, probably also someone on Saint it, obviously. And we can see the silhouette out of the king

538
00:48:37,602 --> 00:48:46,138
observing them. And as they float away, they start to eat the apples because they have eaten since yesterday, and the king is checkpoint to himself

539
00:48:46,758 --> 00:49:02,704
one of the other measles approaches and wonders, you know, why why do you let them go, King? You were gonna... They're gonna tell everyone about us and we're gonna get esther her to death, and the king is un bothered. He says they're not gonna say anything. That's why I gave them the apples

540
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:04,196
The other nasal

541
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:07,009
asked O, you know, they're poisoned.

542
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:09,364
He says the apples are p.

543
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:18,473
And the king tells them nope are dope with git juice so that they're not gonna remember a thing that happened in the last two days.

544
00:49:18,773 --> 00:49:26,802
And so we transition to them arriving back at that peer with the Fisherman he asks them what they saw, what kind of magical

545
00:49:27,141 --> 00:49:29,613
strange sites, and they tell him

546
00:49:30,192 --> 00:49:32,171
Nope. We didn't see a single thing.

547
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:37,143
We comb the ever blades from end to end and saw nothing new or different.

548
00:49:37,638 --> 00:49:46,618
And the last panel donald is saying list. It was some little thing that we Al already for forgotten. And that That closes out the story.

549
00:49:46,956 --> 00:49:51,643
Yeah. Again, very very persistent fishermen on that dock in there.

550
00:49:51,981 --> 00:50:02,030
I didn't even notice this he's... Is he wearing the sam out. It. I believe you I guess why dry a different outfit for a character that's gonna show up on on two different pages

551
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:03,042
So

552
00:50:03,778 --> 00:50:06,033
some some comments on this. I

553
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:12,188
I mentioned I have a lot of problems with the Donald, like, villainous turn in this one. You know, he's

554
00:50:12,807 --> 00:50:16,943
it's pretty evil, the attitude that he has towards them,

555
00:50:17,761 --> 00:50:26,593
I don't like that part of it, but I I really love the progression of this story. I love how weird it is. I love how...

556
00:50:26,973 --> 00:50:33,144
I I really felt like I was and turning the ever blades and getting, you know, deeper and deeper.

557
00:50:33,863 --> 00:50:42,645
And that was getting progressively more and more creepy. I love how Barks realize the setting. And then when we see the measles, I like how

558
00:50:43,622 --> 00:50:47,915
again lived in, he makes their civilization feel in a very

559
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:49,764
short number of pages.

560
00:50:50,499 --> 00:50:54,427
I love the the weird odd touches with

561
00:50:54,764 --> 00:50:55,821
the swell

562
00:50:56,731 --> 00:51:00,661
I love their goofy religion. I love their dialogue

563
00:51:01,915 --> 00:51:07,853
despite the uncomfortable parts of this story. There's just just so much of how Ad audacious

564
00:51:08,431 --> 00:51:09,130
it is

565
00:51:09,587 --> 00:51:17,480
really works for me. I don't know if I'm just like, fossil formalized into my first reading of it from when I was a seven year old,

566
00:51:17,857 --> 00:51:20,589
but this this is probably

567
00:51:21,006 --> 00:51:24,518
my favorite story that we've done so far.

568
00:51:25,098 --> 00:51:27,498
It's definitely among my favorite of Barks.

569
00:51:28,178 --> 00:51:30,358
Very early stories. So

570
00:51:30,658 --> 00:51:34,884
this one this was a lot of fun to go back and read again.

571
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:41,598
It had probably been ten to twenty years since I read this one, but I remembered Everything

572
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:53,139
because as a kid, this was, like one of the very first ones and i read this over and over. I get the feeling that you didn't enjoy it as much. What what were your thoughts as

573
00:51:53,956 --> 00:51:55,034
someone new to Barks?

574
00:51:55,633 --> 00:51:56,133
I

575
00:51:56,511 --> 00:51:59,624
I do think you probably are wearing some nostalgic goggles.

576
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:01,097
Yeah

577
00:52:01,674 --> 00:52:05,527
I'm glad you are aware of how weird it is. It is extremely weird.

578
00:52:06,304 --> 00:52:08,734
We cannot overstate how weird this comic is

579
00:52:09,473 --> 00:52:11,252
I I don't think it has the same

580
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:17,765
like storytelling chops that the other ones did. You know, The other ones had kind of a really clear

581
00:52:18,104 --> 00:52:20,775
movement of the plot and really clear

582
00:52:21,113 --> 00:52:25,644
motivations for all the all the players. And this one seemed more like

583
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:27,320
just kind of

584
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:47,324
a lot of interesting ideas that he had and wanted to use and then he did. Like and like the swelling is really interesting and the big the big God that they follow is interest thing and the like costume and stealing and everything and and, you know, exploring this place that apparently nobody has been in five hundred years. It's interesting stuff and that they have kind of this

585
00:52:48,222 --> 00:52:50,020
hodgepodge of all the cultures they've stolen from.

586
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:58,515
It's interesting, but I don't know why any of these people are doing any of these things. I will I will give you that it's a pretty dis disappointed story.

587
00:52:58,891 --> 00:53:04,314
To me works because it's it's almost like the way you've transitioned from

588
00:53:04,933 --> 00:53:12,729
civilization quote to deep in the swamp. Right? Where all of a sudden, it's it's gotten weird because you're in this different

589
00:53:13,749 --> 00:53:16,328
unknown place. But but... Yeah, Donald

590
00:53:16,629 --> 00:53:17,129
motivations

591
00:53:17,549 --> 00:53:22,664
are... I think the measles have some pretty great motivations. I think they're

592
00:53:22,964 --> 00:53:27,584
behaving in a justified way. You know. They're just trying to keep inter lo

593
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,717
out, but don

594
00:53:30,096 --> 00:53:45,429
I think I think they do make sense until they catch him. And then everything they do after they catch him, I'm not sure why they doing. Oh, where they they like to watch them for sport. Right. And even even even letting them go once we know where they are, we could just capture them again

595
00:53:45,768 --> 00:53:48,024
instead, we're just gonna give them forgetting apples.

596
00:53:48,441 --> 00:53:53,629
Right. You know, you may be right. I might be seeing this through rose colored glasses.

597
00:53:54,203 --> 00:53:55,904
But but I do love this one.

598
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:58,904
As far as how it's regarded

599
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:06,392
among Barks fans, as always, we we take a look at what the index website says. And

600
00:54:07,049 --> 00:54:18,379
so far, this one is gonna fall pretty squarely in the middle of the five stories that we've looked at. Right now, Frozen gold has the highest rating at seven point eight out of ten

601
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:31,219
and too many pets was our our low watermark with seven point one. Mystery of the swamp is at a seven point five which puts it in the ninety nine point third percentile

602
00:54:31,556 --> 00:54:34,624
of all the storage ranked on on the index.

603
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:37,819
I didn't really cover the value for this one

604
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:39,659
because, again, this is...

605
00:54:40,479 --> 00:54:52,224
This is story b in a comment that we already talked about. So we have discussed the value for frozen gold. And, you know, there's a reason that this four color comment is remembered, I'm sure for frozen gold instead of this one.

606
00:54:52,879 --> 00:54:53,379
But

607
00:54:53,799 --> 00:55:05,314
definitely holds a place in my heart. As far as how it holds up, I will readily admit that there's a lot that doesn't work in the modern world about this one. The the attitude

608
00:55:05,814 --> 00:55:08,314
towards the den of nasal

609
00:55:08,974 --> 00:55:09,409
is

610
00:55:10,188 --> 00:55:10,928
pretty awful.

611
00:55:11,387 --> 00:55:11,887
And.

612
00:55:13,145 --> 00:55:17,681
Also, this is... The contrast is so dramatic in the same

613
00:55:18,259 --> 00:55:18,699
cover.

614
00:55:19,313 --> 00:55:20,232
In frozen gold,

615
00:55:20,911 --> 00:55:23,808
the whole thing is they're going to Alaska to bring

616
00:55:24,146 --> 00:55:25,885
needed medicine to the natives

617
00:55:26,438 --> 00:55:30,211
of Barks Alaska or whatever they've called the town. Right And

618
00:55:30,629 --> 00:55:47,889
and he, you know, pride himself on being this hero, doc you know who's saving everybody. And this one is like I'm gonna catch this freak. Yeah. That's some some pretty big whiplash for being in the same episode. You're you're definitely right. So... Yeah, That that doesn't hold up well. I would say that,

619
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:50,288
you know, the depictions of the measles,

620
00:55:50,709 --> 00:55:53,783
they're very, like, hill ish that's

621
00:55:54,282 --> 00:55:55,980
not something that...

622
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:07,654
I mean, we don't we don't really care about that compared to depictions of some other people, but I I think if we really analyze that, it's it's not a very kind. A very kind depiction.

623
00:56:08,232 --> 00:56:09,450
I I would like to think

624
00:56:10,202 --> 00:56:30,400
that... Because I was thinking like if they haven't seen me people in five hundred years where they... Where they getting the hill culture from, you know, the they're dancing and everything. And I've decided that's where the south got it. Sounds from these guys, they can't remember having seen them, but they do remember square dancing And now, they're all playing in the fiddle in the the Panhandle

625
00:56:30,899 --> 00:56:37,688
region of Florida. Yeah. My read was that it just kinda ema from from Florida. Self. But Yeah

626
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:47,741
see up out of the crowd. Some stuff that's kinda dated, but not necessarily problematic is, you know, square dancing. I remember square dancing

627
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:56,820
and Pe as a kid, but I think that would look... I I read this one to my own kid and she had no idea what square dancing was.

628
00:56:57,516 --> 00:57:02,521
Just the whole idea of the ever blade is a place that's une explored that could be hiding anything.

629
00:57:03,073 --> 00:57:03,813
And then

630
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:17,328
as far as appearances, you know, this one is not... I don't think that well remembered it hasn't been referenced a lot. He never did any paintings based on this one that I know of. I did learn that there was a mickey mouse comic published

631
00:57:18,308 --> 00:57:23,903
some decades ago in Brazil. Called second child of the Al nasal knob that

632
00:57:24,244 --> 00:57:26,264
had another appearance of the measles

633
00:57:27,004 --> 00:57:28,798
in in mickey mouse. So

634
00:57:29,497 --> 00:57:35,969
I thought this one i had some pretty good educational value. I I feel like I learned a lot about the other blades themselves.

635
00:57:36,743 --> 00:57:42,717
Maybe not like, specific facts, but kind of like, what kind of plants and animals you would expect.

636
00:57:43,296 --> 00:57:44,954
I think there was some pretty good realistic

637
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:46,925
of things like demand

638
00:57:47,303 --> 00:57:50,196
and and other natural features.

639
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:55,403
How about your favorite panel Ryan. And did you have a favor in this one? I think

640
00:57:55,903 --> 00:57:57,443
I did like one where we're

641
00:57:57,863 --> 00:57:59,763
looking down the side of the

642
00:58:00,238 --> 00:58:01,057
the prison

643
00:58:01,514 --> 00:58:02,014
peter

644
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:03,410
president zig

645
00:58:03,747 --> 00:58:04,925
as the boys are

646
00:58:05,342 --> 00:58:09,963
making their escape right, Where they're looking almost straight down. There's kind of a real

647
00:58:10,744 --> 00:58:15,643
sense of of danger of heights. Is that the one you're talking about? Yeah. Yeah. You get a sense of the

648
00:58:15,984 --> 00:58:16,484
the

649
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:17,218
scale

650
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:18,697
he has really good

651
00:58:19,516 --> 00:58:36,738
perspective on there. You can see the tiny stairs and tiny people way down there. You out couple hundred feet at least probably. You know, it's like standing on the empire state building? Yeah. I like that one a lot too. I I thought this one had a lot of really great panels. I like some... I like the one on the page before that where he

652
00:58:37,157 --> 00:58:38,095
sees the alligator

653
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:41,882
surrounding him in that little pit or whatever.

654
00:58:42,498 --> 00:58:46,641
I don't think I could say anything though, other than the

655
00:58:47,138 --> 00:58:49,592
great panel of old Nasty face

656
00:58:50,487 --> 00:58:51,904
calling the square dance.

657
00:58:52,281 --> 00:58:54,594
That one. That one's an easy winner for me.

658
00:58:55,687 --> 00:59:01,953
But I did consider as a strong runner up the the panel where they approach

659
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,224
the first sign where it says be beware of the measles.

660
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:16,403
I liked the the kind of highlights the way that the mangrove was drawn. And I feel like it had some good, like, atmosphere. Yeah. Let's see

661
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,078
any other

662
00:59:18,615 --> 00:59:19,952
any other closing

663
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:20,604
thoughts

664
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:26,664
I can confirm the ever is a Us national park. It is a one point five million acre Wet preserve.

665
00:59:27,024 --> 00:59:27,704
Excellent. Well,

666
00:59:28,424 --> 00:59:32,453
thank you for bearing with me. Has I shared this

667
00:59:32,951 --> 00:59:33,890
really odd

668
00:59:34,387 --> 00:59:37,334
story that I nonetheless love with you. Our next

669
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:54,354
episode is another personal favorite of mine. It is terror of the River. I'm looking forward to getting a revisit that one. Thank you all for joining us. If you guys have any thoughts or comments, please drop us a line at Barks remarks. At g dot com, and

670
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:56,443
