Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The Podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer and artist of the greatest Donald Scrooge comments of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological publishing order. Hello. I am Mark Sever, a grown man who enjoys donald Inducks com,

2
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:54,216
and I am joined by my guests another grown man who gets to take the role of Carl Barks Newbie. Hello. I'm Ryan Bailey. Excellent. Welcome back. You haven't been scared off. Not yet. I was telling you beforehand that I'm super excited for this

3
00:00:54,833 --> 00:01:02,254
story that we're doing. Today's comment is called the mystery of the swamp this one is a personal favorite of mine.

4
00:01:02,632 --> 00:01:07,417
It is kind of a bonkers story. Yes. I would I would agree with that. Al little bit of background

5
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:14,152
about this story mystery of the swamp was published. It had a release date of January nineteen

6
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:19,569
forty five. This one appeared in four color numbers sixty two,

7
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:42,678
which is the same comment that you and I were doing last episode be because this was the b comment that came after frozen gold. This is something that is very rare. We won't get a lot of comments that release two full lengths stories. So this was all in one... This would have been one issue that someone bought at the. Yeah. Exactly. So got frozen gold.

8
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:46,167
That one had cover art for it.

9
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:54,392
And then mystery of the swamp never didn't have its own cover art originally. Any any cover art would have been done later on.

10
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,305
So this Al that's a lot of comic for your Nickel. Yes. Yeah. Exactly.

11
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:09,104
I think it was a dime at that point, you know, inflation. Yeah. This one is twenty four pages in length about about average for bark. And

12
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,385
this is the first

13
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,944
of what's gonna be many stories where

14
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,558
Donald and the other doug and encounter

15
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:19,754
hidden

16
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:20,831
civilization

17
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:23,622
of lost creatures, basically.

18
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:27,824
So this one is is kind of gonna set template for

19
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,494
several stories, many of which are

20
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:33,622
beloved by fans and and very famous.

21
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,043
So a synopsis of this one. This takes place in the blades. Donald and the nephews, they're gonna explore the Severino blades

22
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:43,120
and encounter a

23
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:46,446
strange race of little creatures called the measles.

24
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:49,876
What when you read this one, Ryan, were you

25
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:52,925
pronouncing it to yourself as the measles or the eagles?

26
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:56,116
I I

27
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:57,554
had the g silent

28
00:02:57,973 --> 00:02:58,892
Al.

29
00:02:58,892 --> 00:02:59,791
Like a new...

30
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,667
Right. Right. So when I was... When I read this for the first time in nineteen eighty seven,

31
00:03:06,123 --> 00:03:08,257
I i definitely pronounced it

32
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:13,937
in my head as the eagles. But, you know, I've come to realize that, yeah, It's it's gotta be silence.

33
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:22,445
I mentioned that this one is personal one for me. This is one of the first probably half a dozen comments I have around.

34
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,885
One of the very Barks

35
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:25,719
stories

36
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:34,483
that I ever read. I I read this one over and over This one really landed my interest in these

37
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:42,546
this template story. It's a little bit a little bit of trivia about this but it kinda sets that template. This is also

38
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,320
an example of something that Carl did on occasion

39
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,089
where he would repeat a story that he did, he would basically

40
00:03:52,586 --> 00:04:04,140
rewrite it and use the same story beats in a different tail. And so Al little more than decade later key is gonna do another story that's very familiar called land of the P Inducks.

41
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,120
That one's probably

42
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,175
better regarded he definitely did it kinda with different eyes in a different attitude.

43
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:17,900
But this one does hold the special place in my heart. Some of the other ones that kind of fit this

44
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:33,055
same template where they, you know, bump into a lot civilization, the very famous plain awful story. I lost Andy land beneath the grounds, probably a few more that I can't remember. So last time, I remember that you had mentioned

45
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:40,731
you mentioned something about the setting and how important how it seems like Carl Barks really Inducks excuse to

46
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:51,659
set a story somewhere and and just explore the setting. And I like that because... Because I think that's definitely the case. You know, and this one, you can tell, you really it really want to

47
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:55,659
draw the ever Gladstone really wants to explore the grades,

48
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:00,030
and they're very central. To this story. Yeah. Definitely.

49
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:14,565
Yeah. The setting is a lot like frozen gold. It's a big part of what's going on. Right. You can tell... Because he really goes into a lot of detail with the art. And, you know, it's still very cartoony, but it also looks like it has a lot of

50
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:23,133
more realistic details. He didn't just draw what he felt like, we're good swamp plans. I can tell that he was drawing from

51
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,387
from a source.

52
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:30,090
I think that it helps to kind of treat the setting as almost an additional character during these.

53
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:39,276
And the ever Gladstone to me, this is like where I learned about the blades for the first time. So I always viewed it as this imp

54
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:43,916
mysterious swamp. And it was kind of a bummer later on to learn that,

55
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:46,826
you know, the Blades is a fragile

56
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:50,755
ecosystem that being who developed constantly.

57
00:05:51,495 --> 00:06:01,515
But a little bit about the place itself, this is the wiki wikipedia rabbit hole that I went It is the largest sub tropical wilderness in the United States.

58
00:06:02,491 --> 00:06:03,807
What is depicted.

59
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:08,153
Today you can view large portions of it on web webcam.

60
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:10,670
It's being over developed constantly.

61
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:15,919
And I I found this interesting. The blades themselves have never really been in,

62
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:18,314
but a lot of tribes

63
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,541
historically lived around them and canoe through them constantly.

64
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:23,458
So

65
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:25,664
it is interesting to think that it's

66
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:28,336
on lives if not une.

67
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:31,165
And then Po Leon

68
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,317
was mentioned in this story

69
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:35,804
he did not really go

70
00:06:36,222 --> 00:06:40,610
deep into the grades from what I can tell, but, of course, he was in that area.

71
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:44,324
And did look for the the fountain of use.

72
00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:54,486
I also really liked learning that, apparently, there's a ghost town within the ever glad called the lost City that throughout history was used either by native of Americans

73
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:56,961
or apparently A capo

74
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,846
used it for a time is like a hide out.

75
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,710
Notable appearances isn't this one, of course, are gonna be the

76
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:04,485
themselves.

77
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:16,953
And then I don't I didn't know whether the count old nasty face since he's not really extension, but... But I'll mention him anyway. Nasty face, of course, also spelled with a sign g at the front. Yeah. I should kept track of all the

78
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:27,986
all the different Gm words in this. I... And and researching this one I did find that Barks based this one off of... You know, he was inspired by no.

79
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:34,382
So that's why where the style g comes from. But I just I love that, that expectation.

80
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:35,261
And

81
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:43,585
it made it really fun to read every time the needs are speaking. But, yeah, let's let's get into the story itself. This

82
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:44,464
story

83
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,980
starts out with donald and and nephews

84
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,592
on vacation

85
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,927
in in Southern, Florida.

86
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:54,143
You know, maybe this is their nice

87
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,081
warm vacation that they kept mentioning. They wanted to go to at the during during frozen gold.

88
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:05,131
I they finally took their plan somewhere warm. Yeah. Exactly

89
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:10,013
So they're they're just finishing on a pier, but Donald is bored, and he

90
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,259
explains that he's planning to be He he's timing for adventure.

91
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:17,739
He'd like to be Al explorer like the old time sailors.

92
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:24,491
And the nephews point out that there is nothing left to discover everything's been explored.

93
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,965
And, you know, Donald spares that and they're overheard by another fisherman on the dock.

94
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,996
And he motions

95
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:39,461
at the ever blades and he says that, you know, there's thousands of un undiscovered

96
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:41,554
miles waiting to be discovered

97
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:46,194
full of strange sites right here in our backyard in the blades.

98
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,767
Donald is is skeptical.

99
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:49,964
But,

100
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,672
you know, this to me is really interesting because

101
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:55,325
around this time,

102
00:08:55,764 --> 00:09:03,668
I think it's it's right at the end of when you could credible say that there's still these, like un undiscovered traps

103
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:19,134
of the earth, You know, today. We have Google Maps, and we have satellites, and we pretty much know what's out there. But all this stuff was really in its infancy. So, like, I feel like these stories were more plausible, and this is just

104
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,774
such a throwback to that sense

105
00:09:22,274 --> 00:09:32,603
of Discovery. That's why Indiana Jones To be set during this period instead of twenty twenty one. Yeah. Exactly. This this is the this is the agent of adventure.

106
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:33,814
So

107
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:34,934
the nephews,

108
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,294
they mentioned that the ever glaze is the previous

109
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:45,589
swamp in the world. I've seen enough photos that I don't think it really looks that creepy, but I'll give it to him.

110
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:57,324
And the the fish eggs them on and he he Donald says sure. We'll do it. So they visit a finley avail Macy's department store called Macy's in the com, and

111
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,579
donald un

112
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:02,939
wants to spring for the nicest camping gear.

113
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,191
And so they outfit themselves for this Ever everybody's adventure.

114
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,586
And as they past the fisherman,

115
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:15,228
Donald it again is really skeptical. He says, yeah, I don't expect to see anything

116
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:16,624
impressive Al all.

117
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:20,612
One thing I noticed on this page was

118
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:26,458
Donald walks macy's and says here Clark out is for a comfortable tour of some sleepy lagoon

119
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:28,395
But if you look even closer,

120
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:40,661
You can see the voice bubble is actually coming from the clerk. Yeah. It's just an error that nobody caught. Yeah. And I definitely caught that at age seven, and it always weird me out and confused me. So...

121
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:52,781
Yeah. I'll have to look at a the later reprint and see if that's something they ever fixed. But, you know, I know there's a lot of, like, lettering errors and stuff that that never get correct. And so I I said those at some point it's like,

122
00:10:53,873 --> 00:10:58,847
fossil and you don't wanna fit some of these errors. Yeah. It's part of the part of the artifact.

123
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:09,099
So Barks transitions them right into the swamp. He doesn't even, you know, spend any time on their first day, which I think gives you an idea

124
00:11:09,454 --> 00:11:18,056
of of what he's going for. That they don't see anything interesting, and they're just settling in for the night. They're... They've taken up on one of those little islands

125
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:35,139
sitting a implants Barks. Yeah. And I I found this really appealing as a kid. You know, there's something about the idea of like your own tiny little personal islands that feels almost like a playground round or something. So that was Al aspect of the story I liked the idea of this tenth set up on this

126
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:43,330
island that doesn't look like. It's more than a few hundred feet across. And so they're they're really enjoying themselves. This is more like a john t vacation.

127
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:44,384
And

128
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,684
as they put out the can fire and get ready for bed,

129
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:57,800
the Nephews comments on the need to lock up their camping gear, Donald like now. We don't need to worry about that. We're way out here. There's no thieves.

130
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,800
Oh, I didn't mention that the Nephew used comments

131
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:10,445
that they are deeper at this point in the swamp than any other person has ever been. So that added to me to the to the sensitive fore voting.

132
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:18,184
The next morning, they wake up and they find out that their camp is almost completely bare. Everything

133
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:25,501
that they've set up has been stolen and all they've about left is the tenth and the boat. When Donald comes out with a shot run to look around

134
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:37,972
by the time they turned back, their tent has also been seriously stolen. So this one is is setting it up really quickly that something serious is going on,

135
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:38,851
and

136
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,089
it's gonna get kind of progressively

137
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:43,745
more creepy and weird. Yeah.

138
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,319
It's interesting. There were no footprints either.

139
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,459
Yeah. Into like, wet sand.

140
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,599
Yeah. The nephews do comment.

141
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:58,620
So on the next page, they are searching on their little island for the thief. There's some really cool scenery, some nice artwork

142
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:01,149
swamp plants and an alligator.

143
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:05,909
They come back to their camp and they haven't found any sign of

144
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:11,083
anyone. But by the time they come back, they're sleeping bags are now missing as well.

145
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:12,681
Donald is

146
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,557
getting frustrated. Characters is angry.

147
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:19,809
They comment that boat is now the only thing left

148
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:20,809
and

149
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:27,577
really nice gag Al just at that moment, the boat starts to move seemingly under it's own power.

150
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:37,120
Now we don't even have that. So they they grab on to the boat but it's it's not the thief. So they think it's just a a guard alligator.

151
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:39,311
You know, that's a pretty big alligator

152
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:40,984
to to be

153
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:49,716
not be scared ass. Donald has seen everything by this point. He's so jade. He's just... There's... You know, just one eye alligator. He used to wrestle five all the time.

154
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:55,829
Yeah. We're only a few stories in and and they're they're already pretty seasoned. So

155
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:58,809
so they climb into their boat on the next page.

156
00:13:59,463 --> 00:13:59,963
And

157
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:01,358
they

158
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,112
decided they need to

159
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:04,507
explore

160
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:05,464
and

161
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,504
investigate the different water ways to see if they can find something.

162
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,576
They use the the word.

163
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:16,314
I looked up how to pronounce this, but I've already forgotten it It's a flu,

164
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:24,147
Al slew. That's right. I keep wanting to say it is s in my head, but That makes sense Yeah. English is nonsense.

165
00:14:24,643 --> 00:14:34,449
Yeah. No. There's a there's a big slew right by my house. There's actually a couple of them. So your understanding of a slew is like a a water way with in within Al an existing

166
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:35,844
body of water.

167
00:14:36,341 --> 00:15:01,839
I'm not sure in what way, it's not Al like a a reef River or a creek. Because the the one here just looks like a river and we have people pad around in them and stuff and a lot of plant life and animals and stuff. So, yeah. I'm not sure what the what the distinguishing characteristic is. So this is where it starts to get pretty weird. The nephews are protests thing that they're going deeper. They're saying that this is really creepy.

168
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:03,599
They approach

169
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:11,509
a tree that has a large sign on it. And Donald Points outlook. There's a sign up here. You know, It can't... There's nothing to be afraid of.

170
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:22,007
And the the tree is on a really cool looking man. Or the sign. Excuse me is on a really cool looking member of tree. And when they approach, the sign ominous

171
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:24,761
says be beware of the nasal.

172
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:28,528
And the kids asked donald what measles,

173
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:32,879
but he's never heard of them, and he speculate

174
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:36,009
that it must be a gang of swamp kids.

175
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:37,849
So he's not the deter

176
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:48,566
towards seem to... This would seem to contradict their earlier assessment that they had gone further into the swamp than anyone had ever gone before since there's a sign mailed to the tree.

177
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:53,259
Right. Right. And he pretty cash. We thought, must be swamp kits. But

178
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:04,345
so they they come up to another sign that's a follow that says you read that sign. Didn't you turn back Donald is not deter he

179
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,119
is gonna keep going.

180
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:10,959
And at this point, his hat and struck off his head

181
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:12,979
by by an arrow.

182
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:20,516
And when they go to investigate, they still can't find any sign that there's anyone around. They don't see any tracks

183
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:24,049
The only thing they see is another old alligator.

184
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:29,409
At this point, age seven, I was fascinated by alligator.

185
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:38,794
So I watched more about them as the average kid. And they are being pretty casual around these like twelve of gate.

186
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:41,304
But

187
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:44,550
once they give up searching on this little island,

188
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:47,941
they get back in the boat and the alligator

189
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,338
looks at them with kind of a

190
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:52,215
suspect it's expression

191
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,709
and we get our first glimpse of the nasal

192
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:57,829
as we see

193
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:00,789
three pairs of seats

194
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:10,115
beneath the alligator. It's it's a a either dead alligator a costume or something that some little creatures have clearly been hiding

195
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,289
and we figured that that's how they've been getting around undetected.

196
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:18,529
I like to think that previous campers had come with

197
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:19,729
a

198
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:31,286
life science alligator costume, and they they boosted it off those guys and and are using it now. Right. Because we'll we'll find out that they like to deal and collect things.

199
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:32,123
So

200
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:34,594
we see the nephews continue

201
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,430
to

202
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,720
go and deeper into the swamp.

203
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:46,185
And we get Al a neat perspective change at the bottom of this page where we see one of these creatures in silhouette.

204
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,420
At the top of a tree

205
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,200
pointing down at them with a really angry expression on his face.

206
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:57,866
And then it pulls back, and we we actually hear from the measles

207
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:01,995
and they say pepper the Nose critters nasal.

208
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:05,579
And and so this is where we get our taste of

209
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,014
their dialogue.

210
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:08,847
They're

211
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:13,775
everywhere that they use the starts with end. They're gonna use a a silent g,

212
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:17,215
like, like the words Nash or net

213
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:18,355
or no.

214
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,704
And they're gonna talk with kind of a a hi

215
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:23,660
Huey, people accent.

216
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:28,251
And I really myers the... They have the kind of the standard, like, Disney

217
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:31,894
big round nose. But then you can see their ears are kind of

218
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,209
thin like you would expect on like, a dragon or some kind of pre fish or something.

219
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,404
Yeah. Kind of a mysterious

220
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,119
critter to

221
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:50,040
categorize. Right. I I don't... They're definitely reminiscent of no, but they also look very unique and those, like, weird finn

222
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,336
years. They kinda like Al aquatic to me or something.

223
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:57,279
Yeah. I I really like on this page, the different

224
00:18:57,616 --> 00:19:02,054
perspectives that we get because we see kind of a regular perspective of the Inducks

225
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:08,454
Al ground level, and then we go up into that tree and we're angled almost straight down, looking at the boat.

226
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:11,085
And then we see the measles

227
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:19,164
up in there trees. I think it's really cool. Yeah. That's really good framing. It's very cinematic. It is. And it's...

228
00:19:19,864 --> 00:19:21,664
Just the kind of the way that Barks

229
00:19:22,464 --> 00:19:32,259
reveals a little bit more gradually of the needs this is cool. So on the next page, the kids are ambushed by a hail and arrow fire.

230
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:39,244
Not to worry. These arrows are are all blunt because they're meant to be warning shots And

231
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:49,446
donald the kids see that the arrows are coming from the trees. They don't see anyone probably because the measles are still high and so of small. As they approach

232
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,321
a an old log

233
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:54,054
that's like, the Barks from an old tree,

234
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,534
they... Donald is, like let's

235
00:19:56,874 --> 00:20:01,429
use that to shield ourselves. And this works out really well. And the

236
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:05,524
yell at them. They yell to to go back and

237
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:19,383
We haven't had human critters in the land of the measles for a million years. And donald deals back and still doesn't think that they're anything special. And then once the halo of arrows stops, they decide to take a peek

238
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:20,622
So Donald

239
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:26,083
wants to look out one direction towards one bank, and then that a look at the other.

240
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:30,706
And Donald is surprised when they lifted off to see a

241
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,451
small village of hut on s.

242
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:44,649
And when he tells Al nephews to take a look at it, the village has completely disappeared. So these these needles are really good at moving a lot of stuff

243
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:50,609
very quickly. I think it's also interesting at this point that Dom keeps making his comments like these are

244
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:52,469
miss mischievous kids.

245
00:20:53,124 --> 00:20:55,819
And so far, we haven't actually seen anything to

246
00:20:56,996 --> 00:21:02,385
to show that they're not. Like you we can see out of the add their feet out of the alligator costume coming out the bottom of the alligator costume.

247
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:15,404
Kinda look like little kids, and then we see the little guy in the tree and all the other little guys and Silhouette. Maybe this is is just like a lord of the flies gang of little kids, you know? Sure. Yeah. There's no reason to think otherwise. I mean, maybe the arrows.

248
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:18,424
So at this point, they

249
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:20,516
they continue on...

250
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:26,892
There's a great gag here that really just needs to be red word for word. Donald says there's

251
00:21:27,644 --> 00:21:35,559
those houses didn't didn't just get up and run away. And then on the next panel, they see the house is literally running away. The still

252
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:55,615
strips driving across the water. And nephew to say the dickens they didn't. There they go running now. I I really like this part of the story where things are just getting... It feels like things are getting weirder and weirder as they go deeper and deeper into the swamp. Like, at this point, the story, anything feels possible

253
00:21:56,234 --> 00:22:01,703
like like, what that fisherman at the dock was saying you who knows what's in the I thought

254
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,219
the running

255
00:22:03,596 --> 00:22:19,272
houses on s would be part of the mystery ministry that we get had explained later, but it it never really did. So I'm still here on a subsequent reading. Not really sure what's going on in this picture. Are there teams of people inside like like rowe on an ancient Greek boat? I'm just picturing

256
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,828
a bunch of measles

257
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,901
that, you know, they've got their drill. They don't wanna be

258
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:32,722
discovered. They've got some mechanism that's causing it to run along. But to me, it's just supposed to give a little bit more color as it's weird.

259
00:22:33,322 --> 00:22:51,089
We're in the swamp. We're we're in measles territory now. So Donald still doesn't take this seriously. He jumps out of the boat and he is going to... He's pursuing them with a shotgun on before he has a chance to shoot their s off, the one of the

260
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:55,864
calls out to fire at them not with blunt arrows.

261
00:22:56,164 --> 00:23:05,061
And Donald gets shot right in the butt which causes him to drop the shotgun and bucks shot peppers one of the measles

262
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:11,861
and we get a good luck at him for the first time as you donald and the kids,

263
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,219
and they are staring on

264
00:23:14,598 --> 00:23:25,089
with just shock at these little create critters that again look like no, they've got kind of a weird mix of clothing on. They look kinda like hi abilities

265
00:23:25,466 --> 00:23:25,966
and

266
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:27,043
one of the

267
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,494
who has a crown on tells them all to meet back tonight at a place called

268
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:35,614
knob. Yeah. Yeah. We do... It is a very

269
00:23:36,169 --> 00:24:00,379
probably intentional parallel here on the two side by side frames of donald looping up and getting shot in the butt with an arrow and the n getting popped off of his tree there, getting shot in the about by mcdonald's Inducks shot. Hey. You're right. They've got... They've got almost the same pose. It's drawn from the same angle. So On the next page, donald kids are speculating on on what the heck they are and

270
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:23,514
Donald is puzzled, but he wants to follow them, and they don't they're not able to track the measles. So we transitioned to that night. The nephews user comment on how scared they were of the shotgun because that's what caused all the reasons to to break into the swamp. And later that night, they can hear some drumming from a ways off. And they figured that it must be the

271
00:24:24,054 --> 00:24:25,214
having a war dance.

272
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:33,325
And the nephews are freaked out, but Donald says, no, We can't leave. We might never be able to find this place again, and he's

273
00:24:34,063 --> 00:24:35,722
he's really determined

274
00:24:36,061 --> 00:24:37,720
to get some evidence

275
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:44,138
measles. Because, again, you know, he explained at the beginning of the story that Huey, really like to me Explorer.

276
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:47,923
So, I guess that's why he's so determined

277
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,576
to to track them.

278
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:56,113
And this is this... I mean, this is one of a few places in the story where I'm not sure what is motivating

279
00:24:56,572 --> 00:24:57,272
the characters.

280
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,908
I mean, if he wants to discover things,

281
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:01,027
he has...

282
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:09,399
You know what I mean? And he can he could leave, you know, they're obviously in some danger they're in, you know, these people's territory

283
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:13,205
they don't have many more supplies except for the both that they took back from the.

284
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:16,156
Probably would have been sensible to

285
00:25:16,613 --> 00:25:19,227
go back home or at least go back and resume your vacation.

286
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:23,919
Yeah. I think at this point, he's more motivated by his own stubborn

287
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:25,219
Tennessee to.

288
00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:28,459
Because you're right. There's not... There's not a great reason.

289
00:25:28,914 --> 00:25:31,154
Behind this other than to advance the story.

290
00:25:31,674 --> 00:25:37,374
But I I think we see this in a lot of the earlier Barks stories where

291
00:25:38,448 --> 00:25:43,064
that's that is kind of his motivation. So they they follow the noise

292
00:25:43,563 --> 00:25:47,100
to what must be nasal knob. When they're kind of

293
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:55,296
sneaking up and approaching these knob It's it's really crazy because we can see the nasal Barks square dancing

294
00:25:55,928 --> 00:25:57,943
and they're in front of a large

295
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,020
temple

296
00:25:59,477 --> 00:26:04,562
that what we're about to discover has a large statue of, like, a nasal

297
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:21,999
deity or a nasal god of some kind. One of the weirdest scenes in any of the Barks stories i... And the idle is on top of this kind of short what pyramid kind of aztec pyramid maybe like a Y almost. And we focus on the king of the ea

298
00:26:22,553 --> 00:26:28,002
who is cha his people. And he's pointing at the idle

299
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,569
Their deity is named old nasty face. And he

300
00:26:32,949 --> 00:26:33,449
treats

301
00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:35,769
nasty face to send a lightning

302
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:38,009
to wipe out the human critters

303
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:45,978
and nasty face being a large stone idle doesn't answer. And the measles they seem to have their

304
00:26:46,317 --> 00:26:51,186
their religion seems to be pretty pretty consistent. If they don't hear anything

305
00:26:51,684 --> 00:26:57,428
from him, it is evidence that he wants them to do the job then cells, but they're terrified

306
00:26:57,805 --> 00:27:02,926
of the shooter gun. And Donald and the kids over here the king say

307
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:04,777
you gotta feed them to the alligator.

308
00:27:05,236 --> 00:27:10,650
But before that, they gotta continue their dance. When we transition back to Donald and the nephews

309
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:22,092
you know, they're like, well, of course, we gotta get out of here. But Donald is pondering, and he has what he describes is a devilish idea they they're gonna kid map and me

310
00:27:22,469 --> 00:27:24,284
to take back to prove

311
00:27:24,741 --> 00:27:31,444
what we've seen. And I've definitely got thoughts about turn, but I'm I'm sure you do. So

312
00:27:31,864 --> 00:27:32,664
what what do you think?

313
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:36,844
He has gone completely crazy from

314
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,979
swamp guests, I'm going to assume or something has

315
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:52,554
affected Inducks nevermind. I'm surprised the nephews went along with this far, but But at this point, they're they're willing to voice to their caretaker. Yes. This is this is crazy we need to get out of here and get back to a real city

316
00:27:53,014 --> 00:27:53,729
where they're not gonna

317
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:56,289
sacrifice to their giant statue.

318
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:01,209
Right. Yeah. So this this is admittedly a a pretty villainous

319
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:03,179
Ke turn for Donald.

320
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:09,015
Even back then, I didn't like seeing this as much as I do really enjoy this story.

321
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:15,763
Bark, I think at this time is really finding the character, and I'm sure is really influenced by the old,

322
00:28:16,102 --> 00:28:16,961
you know, cartoons

323
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,800
that

324
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:28,939
that he himself spent some time working on So donald is kind of, like an avatar for the kind of main character that he wants in these comics and

325
00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:35,494
sometimes he's gonna be a really noble every man, and sometimes he's gonna be kind of jerk. And then this one, he's he's a jerk

326
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:42,556
This is obviously a terrible idea. You know, they're they're inter developers here, and he even uses the word kid kidnapped

327
00:28:42,949 --> 00:29:00,556
so I I don't think there's any... He's not confused about what it is that he's trying to do. And and other reason this is uncomfortable is, like, the are they're not humans. Right? But but they are Huey,. They're they're just little. They're they're talking. They're they have, like, Al society, their so...

328
00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:01,393
So

329
00:29:01,851 --> 00:29:14,374
this is coming from a perspective that doesn't speak well of of donald or attitudes at that time. And, you know, in some ways this is kind of like an American perspective. Right? We're we're gonna go in.

330
00:29:15,028 --> 00:29:21,362
And we're gonna do what we want because we're right. He said, on the first page, he wanted it to be, like columbus and drake.

331
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:34,729
You gotta bring back some specimens to show to to proper civilization. Right? Yeah. The the savages that you find out in the out in the new world place. So so an uncomfortable part of the story, but

332
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:40,980
it definitely advances the plot. They are And in quick quicktime, they encounter

333
00:29:41,717 --> 00:29:42,217
nasal

334
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:50,577
sleeping beneath the tree. They decide Donald decides that this is the guy and they capture him shockingly easily.

335
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:55,784
You know, I almost wondered if he is just pretending to be Al asleep there because they can

336
00:29:56,284 --> 00:30:09,013
bind and gag him without him waking up. They take him back to their boat. And at this point, Dawn has broke, and they are leaving, they're gonna try to not leave any kind of a trail for measles.

337
00:30:09,412 --> 00:30:09,912
But

338
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:16,633
we flash to the n who has woken up and with his feet has grabs

339
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:18,269
a bunch of grapes

340
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:19,679
and is

341
00:30:20,178 --> 00:30:20,678
depositing

342
00:30:21,294 --> 00:30:34,579
individual grapes in the water leaving a pretty ingenious trail that should be very easy for the nasal to fall. The grapes sir are loading like on the surface of the water that leave like a like a bread crumb kind of trail.

343
00:30:35,117 --> 00:30:36,616
Yeah. I... This...

344
00:30:37,355 --> 00:30:39,586
This seemed very con contributes to me.

345
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:40,704
There's,

346
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:43,357
like, wear on earth, did those scripts just come from?

347
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:58,149
He... Like, you can see the panel before where they're carrying him from his sleeping spot that's not like he had grapes on him when they grabbed him, and there's no groups in the boat because they're they've been stripped them everything except their boat. Sure. So he just suddenly has them.

348
00:30:58,469 --> 00:30:58,969
Maybe

349
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:10,097
maybe the grapes were already... You know, maybe there's a lunch pale and or some. Okay. I don't know. That that doesn't bother me the way that some of the other kind of villainous details in this.

350
00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:11,096
But...

351
00:31:11,475 --> 00:31:16,385
But I think that's fair point. When I was a kid, I loved this. I thought this was such a neat

352
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:26,710
neat wave of of tracking and Barks obviously really liked it, because he's gonna go back to this bit in that later comment that I had mentioned call land the Big Inducks. But,

353
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:31,545
yeah. This is how they're gonna... They're gonna be caught and on the next page

354
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:33,596
Donald feeling confident,

355
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:43,354
so he takes off the nasal gag and immediately and predictably, the nasal calls out for help and they can hear...

356
00:31:43,774 --> 00:31:53,996
The Name is Napoleon. They they're they've all got names that start with g n And so his his fellow measles are not far behind

357
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:59,794
So they gag him again. Donald tells them that that row into the reads and how hide

358
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:03,227
kind of in a a tough of tall reads.

359
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:06,779
But the nasal is very resourceful,

360
00:32:07,277 --> 00:32:11,786
especially with his feet. He grabs a shot down and Barks it against the boat

361
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:24,387
and so they're sure that they're gonna be tracked. But Donald is also very bright. And he tells them that they need to rapidly sync their boat and use some hollow reads

362
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:26,004
to breathe through.

363
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:28,199
That's also very clever.

364
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:35,359
Right. Yeah. These these were all things that has a seven year old. They just seemed like the height of, you know, outdoor

365
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,852
adventure

366
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:42,849
survival pursue whatever to me. And and so we got a really cool panel next of

367
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:45,443
the Nephews and the captive

368
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:46,679
breathing

369
00:32:47,096 --> 00:32:48,394
underwater through reads,

370
00:32:48,851 --> 00:32:49,909
while the other

371
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:51,265
are growing

372
00:32:51,643 --> 00:33:02,665
right over them. That I like that panel Al lot. And so they're in the clear, however, the measles are now between them and the post, so they don't think that they're gonna be able to sleep past them.

373
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:09,819
And the nephews have a good idea this point, they decide that they can use the reed to disguise themselves as measles

374
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:22,624
which Donald describes is a risky idea, which clearly I don't think you can weave beards and fake hats in that span of time, which is what they do, but it makes for a cool visual

375
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:34,009
of seeing them disguised as measles. And as they're growing past, we have a moment where we think they've been discovered because the team calls out, but he's just giving them instructions to search the

376
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:35,089
and

377
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,609
they are very relieved. Yeah. I

378
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:38,569
I like

379
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:44,384
making the custom out of the reed just feels like the exact same category to me as the

380
00:33:45,364 --> 00:33:59,680
knock out a guard as you're trying to escape and then pull him into a like, a service closet, And then one second later step out of the service closet wearing his clothes. It's a a standard trip. We It's Al classic. It's a classic for a reason. Yeah.

381
00:34:00,412 --> 00:34:03,263
So they've managed to get past them

382
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:12,608
and Donald is a lookout on the tree. He sees that they've turned back and he says it's it's safe now to make a cage for our little pet

383
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:20,934
are the words that he uses. And again, you know, I I know the nasal are fictional creatures, but this is this is obviously, like, super d

384
00:34:21,954 --> 00:34:27,829
on his part because can. He... The, like, has a name, it can speak.

385
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:39,611
So they are it's you can square dance it can grab it this pop partner and throw Al left. They they can make a pretty quick hat they can construct a wooden cage quickly.

386
00:34:40,466 --> 00:34:42,799
While they're doing it, they're talking about how

387
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:52,545
impressed people are gonna be when they see. You know, I noticed the Nephews used his name. Right? They say when people seen napoleon, they're gonna gas and donald

388
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:59,301
calls him our little pet. So that's a that's a contrast there to me. And

389
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:07,578
when they get him the cage, they... Donald removes the ropes so we can see he's got a pretty sm look on his face, and he he just falls over

390
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:09,255
laughing uproar.

391
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:31,919
And he tells Donald that he's his good is free because he is a swell. I'm sure you are Al puzzled as Donald was. But we're meant to take it literally because he says he can swell up and he perceived to do it. And I love I love Donald line as he's watching it of all the Scrooge football sites

392
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:33,559
because Napoleon

393
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:39,848
breaks through the cage. I'm glad that a sweater would have the force sight to always own

394
00:35:40,387 --> 00:35:42,285
stretchy pants. Just like

395
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:44,379
just like bruce Banner

396
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:48,719
in my comics needs to have the stretchy as purple pants possible.

397
00:35:49,159 --> 00:36:03,900
Some some minor characters is just making a killing selling selling them to various doctors around. Exactly. And And again, this is... This story is crazy Right? Like, this is this is really on ball. This is really weird.

398
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:16,297
I can't look at this with anything other than my seven year old eyes. When I first read this and and just was divided by the story. So I don't know. Maybe you're you're seeing this and it's just

399
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,309
too weird, but I love it. It works.

400
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:24,170
Great for me. And this is something like he's also gonna go back to

401
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:28,357
in what laminate beneath the ground, one of the characters

402
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:33,916
and that is gonna do something very similar to to deliver a message.

403
00:36:34,972 --> 00:36:36,270
So it's it's been fun

404
00:36:36,663 --> 00:36:39,780
to see these things that he he likes to return to.

405
00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:43,236
Napoleon has just

406
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,434
left off this island

407
00:36:45,988 --> 00:36:52,833
and he's bouncing across the water like like a skipping stone or, like a beach fall or something. And

408
00:36:53,171 --> 00:36:54,430
Donald is

409
00:36:54,824 --> 00:37:10,929
too stubborn here because he wants to catch. He refers to him as that free key is gonna fire a shot into the air to spare him so it'll stop. And it does scare him, but only to hide into the brush. And we transitioned to the other measles.

410
00:37:11,683 --> 00:37:18,484
Because they... They're hearing this shotgun none as well. And now they're heading to intercept the docs.

411
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:26,939
Yeah. Still just donald is more concerned with bringing... Bringing the specimen back than any similar they have of safety.

412
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:37,714
Alright. So they they light on to the next dialing and that he's gone to in pursuit. But by this time, the other have managed to station themselves in the trees,

413
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:41,464
and they catch donald in a basket.

414
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:48,578
And I like that it seem a basket seems appropriate seems like some some thought that Barks paid into

415
00:37:49,115 --> 00:37:49,615
what

416
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,739
their civilization would use. Right? And they've got all these River

417
00:37:53,117 --> 00:38:03,792
So... And they they h them up into the trees. Donald doesn't realize that he's up in the trees. So he starts to slice his way out the road. He would have noticed flipping upside down by this point, but...

418
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:12,779
Still think he's sitting on the ground somewhere Right. So by the time, by the time he passed his way out of the basket, he...

419
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:16,690
He plummet to the ground where he is easily captured

420
00:38:17,163 --> 00:38:20,577
and they head back towards me knob with him inbound.

421
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:22,812
He is wondering

422
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:32,299
what's become of the Nephews He asked the the that's piling the boat, and I like how the knees will just kinda cache jerk system

423
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:40,954
backwards and tells and take a look in that best. To behind you and and we see the nephews are are tied up. Yeah. I think it's interesting that

424
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:46,042
the news up to this point have been, like, shooting arrows at him and trying to

425
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,964
cause him some harm. And now that he's been effectively or maybe literally knocked conscious

426
00:38:51,782 --> 00:39:00,585
they're going to bring him back as a specimen now. That's right. So on the next page, we get a really good look at nasal knob in the daylight and

427
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:04,828
there's a big crowd of measles with king on the desk.

428
00:39:05,285 --> 00:39:09,294
And it's interesting that the have kind of like a range of different

429
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,541
hats and outfits

430
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:17,529
from what look like different civilizations throughout different here. And we hear some crowd top

431
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:22,554
they talk about someone says that these are the first humans that

432
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:25,185
he's seen since po leon

433
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:27,193
fifteen third team

434
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,659
commentary about how measles go on forever. And so the king

435
00:39:32,235 --> 00:39:35,345
decree that the nephews user to be locked away in the Al.

436
00:39:36,277 --> 00:39:50,809
Jail. I I was wondering if I... Was to interpret the the phrase first humans months I've seen, since pom leon was through here, He is saying what he sounds like Huey, saying that he personally saw on a day leon. Yeah. That go through there five hundred years ago Yeah.

437
00:39:51,927 --> 00:40:02,233
Four hundred and thirty years ago at this Yeah. It seems like the nasal are very long live. I was thinking you were gonna point out that they referred to dex is humans too. I noticed that

438
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,070
on...

439
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:11,065
The first or second page, the fisherman was saying no no human has been back here, and I thought Are are these characters humans?

440
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,200
Yeah.

441
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:20,855
And and they they are in in these stories, the Ducktales and any of the sent the dog people, the mouse people,

442
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:22,390
they're just humans.

443
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:24,965
So that's something that we never really

444
00:40:25,478 --> 00:40:28,296
To my knowledge, there's never any point where a character

445
00:40:28,835 --> 00:40:33,864
points out Oh, I'm a duck Huey, humanoid Inducks, and there's is a little animal dot

446
00:40:34,562 --> 00:40:38,734
Just hand. There that's who they are. So we learn a little bit about

447
00:40:39,112 --> 00:40:45,451
nes Al law, and Donald is gonna have the chance to get his freedom if he faces off against

448
00:40:45,788 --> 00:40:47,803
one... The new champion.

449
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:53,677
They get led to, like, a an outdoor arena and and this reminded me of the

450
00:40:54,013 --> 00:40:54,911
the, like, outdoor

451
00:40:55,806 --> 00:40:57,182
arena that the

452
00:40:57,837 --> 00:40:58,576
the Maya

453
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:01,849
have that they looked real really reminiscent of it to me.

454
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:05,644
Hope the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. So and

455
00:41:06,302 --> 00:41:17,580
He needs the champ, no dom with style g has always Donald is immediately skeptical because he's he's a pretty tiny little diesel even he's super confident as Donald usually is.

456
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:22,641
But Donald figures out immediately that mustard Dom is also a swell

457
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:29,952
He is in his words, the swell swell that ever sw. So I'm wondering why the needles would make this offer.

458
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:46,009
I it's possible that they're just one hundred percent confident of how this fight is going to go down and they just want some entertainment. But the prospect of a pardon as they put it where I guess Donald can go back home, that would be disastrous just for these guys. They

459
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:51,297
I think they've said by this point, or they're going to say later that they don't they don't wanna get pest by

460
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:54,349
all the time. Yeah. They don't wanna get pest to that.

461
00:41:55,028 --> 00:41:59,014
Which which they absolutely would. Right? You're right. It would be catastrophe for

462
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:02,564
i I agree. I think they like the entertainment.

463
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:10,119
And I don't think they can see that they could ever lose. And I'm guessing if they did you know, they've got the advantage numbers.

464
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:24,017
I don't think... I don't think that offer freedom is really on the table. But Oh no. Another possibility is the part doesn't include leaving. It just includes not being imprisoned. And neither. There you go. They can they can just fade into

465
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:30,164
Society, they can take up swelling. And any humans are gonna be dead in less than a hundred years anyway.

466
00:42:30,803 --> 00:42:32,759
Right. And we'll move on that.

467
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:37,589
Alright. So on the next page, we've got Donald battle against

468
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,007
No dom.

469
00:42:39,526 --> 00:42:41,124
It doesn't go well for donald.

470
00:42:42,178 --> 00:42:43,078
The the

471
00:42:43,696 --> 00:42:44,196
are

472
00:42:44,775 --> 00:42:47,691
very placid watching list. They know what's going on.

473
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:49,684
He... They see no enormous

474
00:42:50,182 --> 00:42:51,480
deflate as he comes down.

475
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:52,437
Just

476
00:42:53,054 --> 00:42:57,002
squishing Donald not gonna wind out of him. I noticed they called him No.

477
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:01,386
Yeah. Like to think I like to think of the way we give our celebrities

478
00:43:01,764 --> 00:43:10,300
nickname. We'll not. Yeah. So on the next page, Donald was days, and they set him up for the hood cross,

479
00:43:10,678 --> 00:43:13,172
the tenth strike. But, anyway, he rolls

480
00:43:13,511 --> 00:43:14,928
himself like a bowling ball

481
00:43:15,306 --> 00:43:15,806
and

482
00:43:16,398 --> 00:43:18,372
flat donald onto a platform

483
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:23,689
in a a lagoon watery pit with very sheer walls.

484
00:43:24,223 --> 00:43:28,549
The king ounces that he's failed when his freedom. It's time to get the Nephews.

485
00:43:29,364 --> 00:43:35,909
And Donald is about to fight bad when he realizes is that the platform has been knocked on to is surrounded

486
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:41,369
by hungry Al. I noticed here he also says, I interpret this as a duck sound. Mark,

487
00:43:42,143 --> 00:43:45,316
Yes. That's what he and he looks down at the alligator.

488
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:56,529
Yeah. That whack expression is gonna come up a lot in the car. Again, I don't even think about it. But so that sound and I guess that's one of the few times, we kinda remember that these Inducks

489
00:43:57,104 --> 00:44:00,161
So on the next page, we transitioned to the nephews

490
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,877
who seem to have been watching what's going on from their

491
00:44:04,415 --> 00:44:05,675
cell of high

492
00:44:06,068 --> 00:44:06,927
in the

493
00:44:07,305 --> 00:44:07,805
xerox.

494
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:13,049
They're are pretty desperate. So they decide that they need to try and split between the bars.

495
00:44:13,702 --> 00:44:20,497
Because there is a couple stories down another cell and so they they form a human chain

496
00:44:21,128 --> 00:44:25,118
and it's it's a pretty perilous and cool looking scene.

497
00:44:25,636 --> 00:44:26,136
I

498
00:44:26,594 --> 00:44:32,220
felt it, you know, as a kid than it will very very dangerous and frightening, the the height that they're

499
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,589
trying to do this maneuver Al. So I... Listen there should be... Listen should be picked ring

500
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:43,029
that mission and impossible scene where tom cruise is climbing the outside of that

501
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:45,202
tower and Oh not.

502
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:48,412
Yeah. That's right. Yeah.

503
00:44:49,249 --> 00:44:51,199
Except it's, you know, eight year olds or

504
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,336
I probably these guys are.

505
00:44:53,855 --> 00:44:54,355
Exactly.

506
00:44:55,173 --> 00:45:00,919
And so they they do make it. Their human chain were they have access to the interior

507
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:11,867
of the temple. They need to figure out some kind of strategy which they go exploring in the interior and they come across the measles, like, their treasure room, they're spoils

508
00:45:12,404 --> 00:45:19,984
And we can see a lot of different things from, again, different areas, different immunizations. There's some made American stuff,

509
00:45:20,324 --> 00:45:22,664
like a a mace suite of armor.

510
00:45:23,244 --> 00:45:25,544
And the the camping gear

511
00:45:25,979 --> 00:45:29,699
the the Ducktales had along with their phone photograph and records. Huey,

512
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:31,639
comments that the measles

513
00:45:32,459 --> 00:45:35,454
expect their idle to talk and so they

514
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:44,983
he says that they need to get that phone photograph into the mouth and so they head upstairs into the mouth of the idle with phone photographs. And we transition out to the,

515
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:50,121
the the king is informed that the lid peters have escaped have escaped

516
00:45:51,194 --> 00:45:52,134
and the king

517
00:45:52,634 --> 00:45:58,908
is telling them that, you know, you gotta hunt them down or old nasty face is gonna be awful for matt. And then we

518
00:45:59,247 --> 00:46:17,920
transition into the isles mouth where we can see it see everything from a distance, they're setting up and they attach a ball string to the starter switch so they can start it remotely. Yeah. I noticed it's the guy bringing the message the king has yet another style of hat that I think of as like a marching band hat.

519
00:46:18,438 --> 00:46:20,651
Right, which seems to imply that

520
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:27,855
someone else has been in the news of civilization pretty recently. I'm assume of Fort Lauderdale high school

521
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:31,026
marching band has lost their band.

522
00:46:32,245 --> 00:46:33,504
Made rest these.

523
00:46:34,442 --> 00:46:38,179
On the next page, the king is directing them to find the nephews

524
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:53,411
But they they show up right behind him very compliant and details his subjects to throw him in the gate pool. But they remind him that you gotta ask the advice of Al nasty face this next panel

525
00:46:53,922 --> 00:46:57,930
feels like the king is is playing a little bit of a con because he

526
00:46:58,386 --> 00:46:59,803
he he agrees,

527
00:47:00,419 --> 00:47:04,248
and you can tell he doesn't expect old nasty face to say anything.

528
00:47:05,268 --> 00:47:07,328
So, you know, I I read this as

529
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:09,743
the king knows that

530
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:11,699
whole nasty faces

531
00:47:12,156 --> 00:47:13,631
is is bunk.

532
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,963
So the king and treats will nasty face,

533
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:23,438
what should they do? And we transitioned to Severino Hue pull that string behind his back.

534
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:24,594
And

535
00:47:24,932 --> 00:47:34,419
well nasty face appears to break into song until tells them everybody dan, grab your partners and circle to the left. And the

536
00:47:34,876 --> 00:47:40,814
are all just jobs snacks or hats. There are many different hats fly off their heads. I like the

537
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,049
the universal

538
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:52,187
signal for alarm, which is your hat shooting into the air. And and little surprise lines above your head. I I just love the visual

539
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:55,834
of this one with with all nasty face.

540
00:47:56,486 --> 00:47:58,182
Being so ridiculous here.

541
00:47:59,236 --> 00:48:07,244
The the way that the way that Barks drew nasty face to me, like, He's he's not... He's he's a god like.

542
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:15,751
Right? Because he's he's got horns. He's larger than life, but he's still not that giant diesel nose. So it feels very in to me.

543
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:20,375
I agree. And and so the nephews are able to

544
00:48:20,752 --> 00:48:21,570
help donald

545
00:48:21,923 --> 00:48:25,415
gave, they make it back to their boat and they very pre

546
00:48:25,873 --> 00:48:26,692
know that

547
00:48:27,189 --> 00:48:36,969
that someone's put a basket of apples in it and, you know, probably also someone on saint, obviously. And we can see the cellular silhouette of the king

548
00:48:37,562 --> 00:48:46,024
observing them. And as they float away, they start to eat the apples because they are meeting since yesterday, and the king's choco to himself,

549
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:47,818
One of the other nasal

550
00:48:48,118 --> 00:48:58,629
approaches and wonders, you know, why why do you let them go king? We're gonna they're gonna tell everyone about us, more than we get passed to death and the king is bothered

551
00:48:58,968 --> 00:49:02,664
He says they're not gonna say anything. That's why I gave them the apples

552
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:04,156
the other n

553
00:49:04,694 --> 00:49:06,990
asked him o. You know, they're poisoned.

554
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,364
He he says the apples are pis,

555
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:18,433
and the king tells him no they're dope with forgetting juice so that they're not gonna remember a thing that happened in the last two days.

556
00:49:18,773 --> 00:49:29,613
And so we transitioned to them arriving back at that pier with the fish and he asked them what they saw what kind of magical strange sites and they tell him

557
00:49:30,152 --> 00:49:31,950
Nope. We didn't see a single thing.

558
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:37,143
We comb the blades from end to end and saw nothing new or different.

559
00:49:37,678 --> 00:49:46,578
And the last panel donald is saying less. It was some little thing that we've already forgotten and that that closes out the story.

560
00:49:46,956 --> 00:49:51,303
Yeah. I did a very very persistent fisherman on that dock in there.

561
00:49:51,981 --> 00:49:55,886
I didn't even noticed is he's... Is he wearing with same out? It. I believe

562
00:49:56,304 --> 00:50:01,990
I guess why dry different outfit for a character that's gonna show up on on two different pages.

563
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:03,042
So

564
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:05,993
some some comments on this. I

565
00:50:06,331 --> 00:50:12,188
I mentioned I have a lot of problems with Donald, like, villainous turn in this one, you know, he's

566
00:50:12,807 --> 00:50:16,903
it's pretty evil. The attitude that he has towards them.

567
00:50:17,761 --> 00:50:26,473
I don't like that part of it, but I I really love the progression of this story. I love how weird it is. I love how

568
00:50:26,933 --> 00:50:33,204
I I really felt like I was entering the ever blades and getting, you know, deeper and deeper.

569
00:50:33,863 --> 00:50:42,526
And that it was getting progressively more and more creepy. I love how Barks realized the setting. And then when we see the, I like how

570
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:47,875
again, lived in, he makes their civilization feel in a very

571
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:49,764
short number of pages.

572
00:50:50,499 --> 00:50:55,782
I love the the weird odd ball touches with the the swelling

573
00:50:56,692 --> 00:51:00,581
I love their goofy religion. I love their dialogue

574
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:07,814
despite the uncomfortable parts of this story. There's just just so much of how A do.

575
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:09,130
It is

576
00:51:09,547 --> 00:51:12,933
really works for me. I don't know if I'm just like

577
00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:17,219
into my first reading of it from when I was a seven year old,

578
00:51:17,817 --> 00:51:18,317
but

579
00:51:18,654 --> 00:51:20,509
this this is probably

580
00:51:20,966 --> 00:51:24,478
my favorite story that we've done so far.

581
00:51:25,098 --> 00:51:27,498
It's definitely among my favorite of Barks

582
00:51:28,138 --> 00:51:30,318
very early story. So

583
00:51:30,658 --> 00:51:34,804
this one this was a lot of fun to go back and read again.

584
00:51:35,381 --> 00:51:50,669
It had probably been ten to twenty years since I read this one, but I remembered everything because as a kid, this was like one of the very first ones and so I Read this over and over I get the feeling that you didn't enjoy it as much.

585
00:51:51,203 --> 00:51:53,139
What what were your thoughts as

586
00:51:53,956 --> 00:51:55,154
someone new to Bark?

587
00:51:55,593 --> 00:51:56,093
I

588
00:51:56,511 --> 00:51:57,649
I do think you

589
00:51:57,987 --> 00:51:59,624
probably are wearing some nostalgic goggles.

590
00:52:00,557 --> 00:52:01,057
Yeah

591
00:52:01,674 --> 00:52:05,527
I'm glad you are aware of how weird it is. It is extremely weird.

592
00:52:06,304 --> 00:52:08,734
We cannot overstate how weird this comic is

593
00:52:09,473 --> 00:52:11,212
I I don't think it has the same,

594
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:17,645
like storytelling chops that the other ones did. You know, The other ones had kind of a really clear

595
00:52:18,064 --> 00:52:20,695
movement of the plot and really clear

596
00:52:21,113 --> 00:52:25,644
motivations for all the... All the players. And this one seemed more like

597
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:27,280
just kind of

598
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:47,324
a lot of interesting ideas that he had and wanted to use and then he did. Like, and like, the swelling is really interesting and the big... The big God that they follow is interest thing and the, like, costume and stealing and everything and and, you know, exploring this place that apparently nobody has been in five hundred years? It's interesting stuff and that they have kind of this

599
00:52:47,823 --> 00:52:49,900
hodgepodge of all the cultures they've stolen from.

600
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:57,240
It's interesting, but I don't know why any of these people are doing any of these things. I will I will give you that it's a pretty

601
00:52:58,015 --> 00:52:58,333
story.

602
00:52:58,891 --> 00:53:04,234
To me it works because it's it's almost like, the way you've transitioned from

603
00:53:04,933 --> 00:53:06,514
civilization quote to

604
00:53:06,853 --> 00:53:12,729
deep in the swamp. Right? Where all of a sudden, it's it's gotten weird because you're in this different

605
00:53:13,749 --> 00:53:16,289
unknown place. But but, yeah, Donald

606
00:53:16,629 --> 00:53:17,129
motivations

607
00:53:17,469 --> 00:53:17,969
are

608
00:53:18,269 --> 00:53:27,524
I think the measles have some pretty great motivations. I think they're behaving in a justified way. You know. They're just trying to keep inter lo.

609
00:53:27,898 --> 00:53:45,415
Out, but dawn only. I think I think they do make sense until they catch him. And then everything they do after they catch him. I'm not sure why doing Where they they like to watch them for sport. Right. And even even even letting them go, once we know where they are, we could just capture them again

610
00:53:45,768 --> 00:53:47,963
instead, we're just gonna give them forgetting apples.

611
00:53:48,401 --> 00:53:53,629
Right. You know, you may be right. I might be seeing this through Rose colored glasses.

612
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:55,944
But but I do love this one.

613
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:58,904
As far as how it's regarded

614
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,904
among Barks fans, as always, we

615
00:54:02,244 --> 00:54:06,432
we take a look at what the index website says. And

616
00:54:07,009 --> 00:54:18,326
so far, this one is gonna fall pretty squarely in the middle of the five stories that we've looked at. Right now, frozen gold has the highest rating at seven point eight out of ten

617
00:54:18,919 --> 00:54:31,180
and too many pets was our our low watermark with seven point one Mystery of the swamp is at a seven point five which puts it in the ninety nine point third percentile

618
00:54:31,556 --> 00:54:37,819
of all the storage ranked on on the index. I didn't really cover the value for this one

619
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:39,659
because again, this is...

620
00:54:40,479 --> 00:54:52,265
This is story b and a comment that we already talked about. So we had discussed the value for frozen gold. And, know, there's a reason that this four color comment is remembered. I'm sure for frozen gold instead of this one.

621
00:54:52,879 --> 00:54:53,379
But

622
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:55,779
definitely holds a place in my heart

623
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:05,314
As far as how it holds up, I will readily admit that there's a lot that doesn't work in the modern world about this one. The the attitude

624
00:55:05,774 --> 00:55:08,714
towards the den and knob

625
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:09,409
is

626
00:55:10,188 --> 00:55:10,928
pretty awful.

627
00:55:11,387 --> 00:55:11,887
And

628
00:55:13,145 --> 00:55:17,601
also, this is the contrast is so dramatic in the same

629
00:55:18,219 --> 00:55:18,659
cover.

630
00:55:19,313 --> 00:55:20,192
In frozen gold...

631
00:55:20,911 --> 00:55:23,768
The whole thing is they're going to Alaska to bring

632
00:55:24,146 --> 00:55:25,885
needed medicine to the natives.

633
00:55:26,438 --> 00:55:30,011
Of Barks Alaska or whatever they've called the town. And

634
00:55:30,669 --> 00:55:47,889
and he, you know, pride himself on being this hero doc you know who's saving everybody and this one is like, I'm gonna cage this freak. Yeah. That's some some pretty big whiplash for being in the same up episode. You're you're definitely right. So, yeah. That that doesn't hold up well. I would say that,

635
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:50,249
you know, the depictions of the measles

636
00:55:50,709 --> 00:55:53,743
they're very, like, hell ish that's

637
00:55:54,242 --> 00:55:55,900
not something that...

638
00:55:56,439 --> 00:56:07,553
I i mean, we don't we don't really care about that compared to depictions of some other people, but I I think if we really analyze that, it's it's not a very kind a very kind depiction.

639
00:56:08,232 --> 00:56:09,450
I I would like to think

640
00:56:10,202 --> 00:56:28,921
that... Because I was thinking, like, if they haven't seen me people in five hundred years where they... Where are they getting the hi billing culture from, you know, there's air dancing and everything, and I've decided that's where the south got it. The sounds from these guys. They can't remember having seen them, but they do remember square dancing And now they're all playing the fiddle in

641
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:37,648
the Panhandle handy region of Florida. Yeah. My read was that it just kinda ema from from Florida self. But Yeah

642
00:56:38,668 --> 00:56:43,248
sleeps up out of the ground. Some stuff that's kinda dated, but not necessarily

643
00:56:43,548 --> 00:56:47,701
problematic is, you know, squared Dancing. I remember squared dancing

644
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:56,820
and pee as a kid, but I think that would look... I I read this one to my own kid and she had no idea what squared dancing was.

645
00:56:57,516 --> 00:57:02,481
Just the whole idea of the ever blade it's Al place that's on explorer that could be hiding anything.

646
00:57:03,073 --> 00:57:03,773
And then

647
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:17,328
as far as appearances, you know, this one is not... I don't think that well remembered. It hasn't been referenced a lot. He Severino did any paintings based on this one that I know of. I did learn that there was a Mickey Mouse comic published

648
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,984
some decades ago in Brazil. Called second child

649
00:57:22,403 --> 00:57:23,903
nasal Knob that

650
00:57:24,244 --> 00:57:26,223
had another appearance of measles

651
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:28,798
in in mickey mouse. So

652
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:35,929
I thought this one had some pretty good educational value. I I feel like I learned a lot about the blades themselves.

653
00:57:36,743 --> 00:57:42,616
Maybe not like specific facts, but kind of like what kind of plants and animals you would expect.

654
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:46,885
I think there were some pretty good realistic pick of things like the demand

655
00:57:47,343 --> 00:57:50,196
and and other natural features.

656
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,249
How about your favorite panel?

657
00:57:52,703 --> 00:57:55,403
Ryan. And did you have a favor in this one? I think

658
00:57:55,863 --> 00:57:57,443
I did, like, one where we're

659
00:57:57,823 --> 00:57:59,723
looking down the side of the

660
00:58:00,238 --> 00:58:01,057
the prison

661
00:58:01,474 --> 00:58:04,925
period Mh. Doesn't Z rot as the boys are

662
00:58:05,342 --> 00:58:09,963
making their escape. Right. Where they're looking almost straight down, There's kind of a real

663
00:58:10,703 --> 00:58:15,643
sense of a danger of height. Is that the one you're thousand about? Yeah. Yeah. You get a sense of the

664
00:58:15,984 --> 00:58:17,064
the scale.

665
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:18,657
He has really good

666
00:58:19,516 --> 00:58:36,724
perspective on there. You can see the tiny stairs and tiny people way down there. You have couple hundred feet at least probably, you know, it's like standing on the empire state building. Yeah. I like that a lot too. I I thought this one had a lot of really great panels. I like some... I like the one on the page before that where he

667
00:58:37,117 --> 00:58:38,056
sees the alligator

668
00:58:38,751 --> 00:58:41,661
surrounding him in that little pit or whatever.

669
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:46,601
I don't think I could say anything though, other than the

670
00:58:47,098 --> 00:58:49,592
great panel of old Nasty face

671
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:51,864
calling the square dance.

672
00:58:52,281 --> 00:58:54,634
That one, that one's an easy winner for me.

673
00:58:55,687 --> 00:59:01,953
But I did consider as a strong runner up the the panel where they approach

674
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,184
the first sign where it says be aware of the measles.

675
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,845
I like the the kind of... I i the way that the man was drawn

676
00:59:11,237 --> 00:59:16,381
and I feel like it had some good, like, atmosphere. Yeah. Let's see.

677
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,038
Any other

678
00:59:18,654 --> 00:59:19,872
any other closing

679
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:20,604
thoughts

680
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:26,484
I can confirm the Is a Us National Park. It is a one point five million acre or wet lens preserve.

681
00:59:27,024 --> 00:59:27,704
Excellent. Well,
