5
00:00:57,423 --> 00:01:05,297
And I'm joined by a couple of returning guest hosts for our episode today about the Many whom mystery

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:10,859
I'm going to introduce them and ask them to say hello and

7
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:16,582
tell about whether they have ever gotten to travel to Hawaii. So we've got

8
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,939
Warren Harmon

9
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:19,734
and Sarah Santiago.

10
00:01:20,152 --> 00:01:47,788
And warren How about you? Hey, Mark. Great to be back. Yeah. I have a few memories of of Hawaii. I went there as a college senior with my roommate on a whim, with less than twenty four hours notice and that last of the weekend, that'll probably never get back. But that was that was a college kid, but then I promised my wife I take her there for her our fifth anniversary, and we spent a week and a half on Maui that was wonderful. Nice. That sounds great. How about you, Sarah?

11
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:49,622
No. I haven't

12
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:57,216
trying to think of, like, the next most tropical place I can think of, but all I can think of is the

13
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,150
wet and Rainy island that I live on that is not tropical, which is great.

14
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:02,890
Yeah.

15
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:15,017
Yeah. I I too have not gotten the travel to Hawaii. I was supposed to go in my early twenties and it fell through for one reason or another.

16
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,705
Probably the most tropical, the most

17
00:02:18,283 --> 00:02:22,055
Hawaiian hide away type place I've been to would be Cancun.

18
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:41,552
Mh. So Hey you guys. This is gonna be a really interesting one today. We get to talk about the Min loo mystery. And I for one, I don't know about you weren't I have to force myself to remember the title because I got this one pretty early on in my bark collecting hay and the

19
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:44,398
album that I got it in had

20
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:45,594
Hawaiian and Hide

21
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:46,830
prominently

22
00:02:47,207 --> 00:03:09,099
displayed as the title. With really cool braun rose cover. So that's how I've always thought of this. Oh, I I I I remember it only as the men honey mystery. I used call the Huey,, and then I had to remember how to pronounce it. But I do know that the alternate title the Hawaiian Hide way was there. And there's a lot of reasons why Hawaii it was chosen Al this

23
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:16,158
is this local for this adventure course. Right. So you guys this is gonna be, I think a really

24
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:25,539
a really interesting one to talk about. The the Men mystery is in a lot of ways, it's not a very typical

25
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:30,117
It's not a very typical bark story. Right?

26
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:37,809
You know what it kinda reminds me of is is it kinda reminds me of Severino sit com had like the Hawaii

27
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:38,585
episode.

28
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,971
But like when was this written?

29
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:44,805
So this one,

30
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:55,224
I might as well go ahead and launch you to that. This one has a cover date of October of nineteen fifty three. Mh. From that pre the the the sixties

31
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:57,685
trend of everybody going to Right.

32
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:02,999
Hawaii, like the brady bunch, etcetera. Yeah. We've that of trend

33
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:12,863
before that... Well I go do you think? I can't say that I know for sure, but but like you, I feel like that didn't really become a a cli a until the sixties,

34
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:16,893
but I think a lot of this had to do with Hawaii statehood

35
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:23,852
being relatively new in the in the early six days. And, you know... And when the story was written, you know, we're only

36
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:34,284
a few years after World war two and twelve years from Pearl Harbor. So it was still pretty fresh in people's minds is probably a more of an exotic location where a war started, but also,

37
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:41,510
it it had a mystery to it. It had this wonderful... Well, which is depicted in the artwork here. Yeah. Just definitely.

38
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:56,369
Romance to it. Yeah those are really good points for and I'm I'm glad you brought up. I I wasn't thinking about fact that, you know, Earl Harbor wasn't wasn't all that long enough. So why you would have been really in people's in the forefront front of a lot of reader minds. Mh...

39
00:04:57,648 --> 00:05:01,344
I I kinda think of this as like Bark Honeymoon.

40
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:02,922
Store.

41
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:06,669
Sure. And it Little was almost his honeymoon one.

42
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:09,898
Yeah. Because, like, the... This is

43
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:13,007
for for a few reasons. Right? Because

44
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,180
I I guess it's fairly well known among Barks fans that ga, his his recent.

45
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,040
He he remarried.

46
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:32,990
Relatively shortly before this. I guess I guess, it's been a year or two. But they they're they're still fairly newly married and and Gary is from Hawaii isn't she? Yeah. That was her home she grew up there.

47
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:45,378
Yeah. So it's it's really sweet. So she she actually... It did suggest this story to him. He... There was a letter that he wrote to michael barrier in in the late seventies.

48
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:54,730
And he he told barrier that Gary had suggested the local for the story and she told him some of the details about them men who is,

49
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,201
and some of the other local stuff So like, she had a real

50
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:00,039
locals

51
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:01,674
knowledge

52
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:11,857
of the islands. And she... And that in that kinda shows. Right? Because Barks is really good at researching but this one definitely has, like, more local touches,

53
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:13,092
more local,

54
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:15,062
lingo and language

55
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:39,325
than than normal. It does. And I was I was pleased to see that and and I think it it is almost stuck. This collaboration pin between Carl and ga was just kinda beginning here. I I think this is the first story that she lena as well. Yeah. So she she collaborate with him. I believe that she did do some of the lettering on the previous one horse Rad story. Okay. But

56
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,127
But like, she's actually doing some of the background where some of the...

57
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:58,155
Because she is of course, a a very good very accomplished artist in her own right. And she would do a lot of collaborating with him starting at this point. And and so for these reasons, you know, this story is is a little bit different.

58
00:06:58,569 --> 00:06:59,548
This is

59
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:00,665
notably,

60
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:05,590
so this is the fourth of the uncle sp Adventure stories.

61
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:10,340
Sarah, I'm gonna have to have you read at least a couple of them because they're really

62
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:11,218
legendary.

63
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:21,510
Right? But Uncle call sp, one, two and three are actually some of the last of his four color stories. And and this was the very first issue where it

64
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:34,786
formally got numbers. As uncle sp number four. It didn't it's not a four color issue at all. Al this point, he's genuinely got his own title. It's not quite monthly because it's It's basically as...

65
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:38,270
As frequently as Coral Barks can pump them out.

66
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:48,036
Yeah. So uncle So this is the first one that kind of isn't really dealing with uncle Scrooge is past

67
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,690
and his mythology.

68
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:57,490
Right Now now he's set up. This is this is one of those first early stories that's gonna have this other typo apology

69
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:08,727
that Barks is gonna go back to a lot. Uncle Scrooge is paranoid about his money and he does something to hide it. So... And, Sarah, you probably

70
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:13,980
even know that story type just from Ducktales. Right? Because that's like a famous.

71
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,510
You know, that... That's one of the stories that people tell about Scrooge.

72
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,007
And I do remember it from when he

73
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:29,644
built some kind of a repository for it and then, like, broke down into, like, the center of the earth Oh, yes. Yeah. We'll

74
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:35,769
I get to cover that story in in a few months. I'll be very excited about that one. Because that's a duck

75
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:40,938
episode that is based on one of the Barks stories. Let's see a little more background.

76
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:43,374
This one has been reprinted

77
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:45,950
kind of an average number of times.

78
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:56,280
Eleven reprint County, the first one. It is one of his, like, full length ones. It's a thirty two pager. So that makes it a little trickier your reprint. Can always

79
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,080
include other stories with these. And

80
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,880
because of the Hawaiian

81
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:12,607
setting. Right? There's definitely a a fair amount of background to talk about. And and I'm I'm one of the things that I really like about this one is that you can tell he really

82
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,205
made an effort.

83
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:22,123
To localize it. Sometimes in some of his stories, he really goes out of his way, he does international

84
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,015
geographic

85
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:30,615
and does some great background, like, lost in the end is very much set in the mountains of the And

86
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,430
in indian country.

87
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,310
Other

88
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:40,121
other stories, you know, he doesn't take as much care. He uses like kinda made up jargon

89
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:41,956
language for the characters.

90
00:09:42,493 --> 00:09:45,786
But in this one he's not going to, like, have characters

91
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:47,157
speak Hawaiian.

92
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:51,903
He he's gonna actually pepper in a lot of real Hawaiian.

93
00:09:52,280 --> 00:10:02,504
And and Sarah, you were asking me beforehand if if I look up if I verified it. As far as I know, all of the Hawaiian words are are real and accurate.

94
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:11,519
And and then there's a lot of, you know, local Flo and fauna, the vegetation that you you can tell again, he would have talked to Ga.

95
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:15,967
Full disclosure. I've never actually heard her name

96
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:16,805
pronounced.

97
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:18,959
Right? Her... Her name is Margaret,

98
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,009
and

99
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:26,290
as like an artist, she had the expectation where she went by G r and an accented

100
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:31,113
e. So in my mind, I've always, like, mentally pronounced that as Ga.

101
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:36,119
But In here. I... That's how I pronounced to to mark. Who knows it we're right maybe a fan.

102
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:44,122
Exactly. Yeah. Someone might be screaming at the podcast right now. No it's not pronounced like that. But, yeah, This this is a really

103
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:51,650
interesting story. There are Barks, I love this one is the kit. Boy, I went back and read this over and over.

104
00:10:52,388 --> 00:11:07,808
I see some parts that don't hold up as well today. I read a review of it online where someone was really critical of it. But I don't know. It's just it's it's nice sometimes to have some of these Barks stories that are radically different. So

105
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:09,045
you guys

106
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:16,918
let's let's mention some of the titles from around the world, and then we can launch into the story itself.

107
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:29,724
So I... Hey, Warren, you you're being very brave often for Denmark. Tell us about the Danish title. The Danish title translates to the invisible friends and it's dead

108
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:41,834
then. I hope I did that justice. I I think that sounded pretty good to my American year. That's that's a fun title. Right? It's it's evo, but it's not direct

109
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:45,171
get too. It it teases you. Teases is the reader. Yeah.

110
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:51,305
Sarah, why don't she hit us with spain's Spanish? I did spend

111
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,995
and they called it La delay, they last Esp,

112
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:57,512
meaning the king of

113
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,658
spinach, which I found interesting because learning Mexican Spanish.

114
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:16,899
Spinach has Mocha being an a non count. Right? Like, like say lettuce it we don't eat lettuce is. We eat lettuce. And so I thought but it was interesting. I looked it up And... Yeah, in Spain,

115
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:20,169
they... It's a countdown. So they say

116
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:33,790
instead of just s not that kind of engine in general. They would say spinach it. Yeah. That's fun. One brand and spinach. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for that. And then I I've got a couple to just

117
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:39,791
rattle off here for French it has generally always been

118
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:40,630
little

119
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,165
or lu me start them the menu.

120
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:45,798
And then

121
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:49,914
Germany really confused me. I I would love it if someone could

122
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:54,402
explain this, but wound name in free

123
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,131
appears to translate to company island peace.

124
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:03,735
I... I'm sure that that that an example of Google not doing a great job of translating.

125
00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:06,792
But but that's what I got. And then

126
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:08,724
you know, in Italy, we've got

127
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,799
Nelly Sol day Min

128
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:17,506
on the island of Men and Likewise in Norway. It's Men Mu

129
00:13:17,979 --> 00:13:18,059
Oh.

130
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:19,899
Island.

131
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,659
So some some of them straightforward a couple of them a little bit more puzzling.

132
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:26,774
And so we've mentioned the Men

133
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:39,844
already. Right? Let me ask you, Sarah, were you already familiar with the, like, legend of the Men? Feel like that's something that they might have introduced to us in one of those sixties

134
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:45,168
columns where they travel to Hawaii. Yeah. But I don't have any, like,

135
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:49,791
specific knowledge of them. I thought it was interesting when

136
00:13:50,368 --> 00:13:52,702
the they were learning about the in

137
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:04,015
and the kids were like oh, is that like a brownie? And I was like, Oh, I could... You know I could talk about brownie, you know, living in Scotland, I'm far less familiar with Min.

138
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:08,129
Right. But a good reference point. Yeah about how about you were

139
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:15,777
No. I I I learned about the men from this story. I... That's what that would revealed it to me was this the fan

140
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:34,347
that I just assumed I really didn't dig into the Hawaiian culture to to check it out until researching this for the podcast. But as a kid, I just enjoyed the mystery. I right doing. That's why I love the title the the men mystery. So are you just learning today that they're not just like in this story that they're

141
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:35,703
standing legend.

142
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,159
Yeah.

143
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:44,248
Nice. That's fun. Yeah Yeah I love that part of it. Yeah. That is cool. So like you, I learned about them

144
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:45,086
from

145
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:56,855
this story, but then probably years so later. Like Sarah mentioned, I think I saw in some hack hack needs Sit home that there was, like, some something about Min. And I was like, oh,

146
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,930
And I realized at that point that it wasn't just

147
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,089
like, the plain off,

148
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:13,321
you know, Barks didn't invent them at him. Yeah right. So because it is like a standing legend, I'm not gonna, like, read off the whole wikipedia entry

149
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:16,246
for you guys or anything. But but I do wanna

150
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:35,369
share just a little bit about them. Right? Because they they go back a little bit of a ways but there's a little bit of debate because there's not a lot of like because Hawaiian legend, you know, is mostly oral. There wasn't, like, a lot written down. From going really far back. So they are indeed a mythological,

151
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:38,121
like, race of of little people

152
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:45,054
in Hawaiian tradition that are said to live in the deep forest and hidden valleys of the islands away from humans.

153
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:49,757
And they're described to be superb craft people they build

154
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:55,358
temples and fish ponds, like we Severino this story and roads and canoe and houses and so on.

155
00:15:56,076 --> 00:16:00,779
And and then some... There are some stretch that still exists that are, you know, legend

156
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:03,411
said to been made by the Men.

157
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:09,769
And so the the fun thing I think or the interesting thing, I think is that

158
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:11,647
there's, like, some scholar

159
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:13,924
debate that they

160
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:15,722
are actually

161
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:29,040
they don't really pre date. The settlement by Europeans of the iowa. That that it was kind of a a myth that was created around that time, because there was, like, some oral memory

162
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,040
of

163
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,440
an... Like Al a tribe that were called the?

164
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:38,443
And and that it referred to, like, lower cost

165
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,280
people

166
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:45,640
instead of little people, and then that may have gotten corrupted over time we're mis misinterpreted

167
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,240
by settlers.

168
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,240
So so I think that's interesting. But whether

169
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,280
regardless of how long

170
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:58,000
stand the legend is, you know, this is a real legend. This is a real story

171
00:16:58,377 --> 00:17:01,747
about these productive keep little people who are helpful,

172
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:24,075
resourceful and and very secretive. So all of that stuff is totally accurate to the man. I I love that part of it, Barks, and I was fascinated by the... By... As you explained it that it's possible that the storytelling table actually came from western in their interpretation of what they Right. It didn't come from Western, but it was it was kind of like a case of telephone.

173
00:17:24,534 --> 00:17:28,270
Where where... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I think that's just a a fabulous

174
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:29,684
way to

175
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:36,524
build a story. That the beautiful part of that is that they just... They they they had been created as this wonderful kind

176
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:55,557
loving people, group of people. I I I love that part of it. Yeah. It's it's very intriguing. Alright. So that's that's a good amount of pro lock. You guys let's let's do it. Let's go into the story. I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about the narrative part of this, and then I want you guys to chime in as you have some thoughts.

177
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:58,227
So men mystery

178
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:07,629
starts out with something that's very dated. A a slideshow show. Uncle Scrooge is presenting some slides.

179
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:09,723
To Donald and the Nephews.

180
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:22,197
Showing a picture of his Private island. And right away, Barks is explaining that he wants to take it his money there for safe keeping. The island itself looks very

181
00:18:22,654 --> 00:18:24,391
cool, very intriguing.

182
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:29,869
It's got some neat geography. It's got what appears to be Al inactive vol Volcano.

183
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:30,789
And,

184
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:34,549
you know, the Inducks are very interested. Donald is asking

185
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:36,849
where is it? Is it in the tropics?

186
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:38,021
And Scrooge

187
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,813
explains that he's bought Severino

188
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:47,589
it in order to be alone with the money, and he just kinda keeps pushing through the columbus converse. Station

189
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:48,508
ignoring

190
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:49,427
Donald

191
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:55,600
and explaining that we are all going there, kinda of bull them into it.

192
00:18:56,294 --> 00:19:02,194
And and this annoys Donald who says, you know, no way, I'm not going to some fever

193
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:09,764
steam tropical island You can't hire us to go, and he's playing into screws his hands here because he says...

194
00:19:10,263 --> 00:19:29,093
Alright. Well, my... My island is a few miles from Hawaii. I won't get lone some. And and as soon as the Inducks hear that, they changed their tune and they get very excited to go, and then Scrooge fin this into them agreeing to do it for free

195
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,950
instead of being paid.

196
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:41,869
Shaves of earlier Scrooge, I think here. I I see a little bit of a an old Scrooge here. Yeah. I mean, he's got a twinkle and his eye. He's not like He's not the scheming...

197
00:19:42,409 --> 00:20:01,781
He's not like the almost villainous and Scrooge of earlier, but he is very connecting very scheming here. I looked up up what their wages would be in twenty twenty two dollars. U. And thirty cents an hour... I did nineteen to fifth because I didn't know specifically what year this was from Thirty cents in nineteen fifty

198
00:20:02,197 --> 00:20:04,224
is three dollars and thirty

199
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:07,741
nine cents in twenty twenty two money. So

200
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:16,329
between what tipped wages are in the Us and actual minimum wage, Right. And and this is a long running trope of Barks

201
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:21,629
specifically, Sarah. The the thirty cents an hour is the cli.

202
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:25,044
I I like the opener. I think it's very

203
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,144
intriguing. It's funny.

204
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:44,364
I feel like it it makes us very a side by laying out the map of the island, we can't wait to see it. I thought it was clever that using this slide projector as a device for... I don't know if it's called a mas head in a comic but that opening...

205
00:20:44,741 --> 00:21:06,029
Yeah. We probably all of the splash panel. The splash channel, I... It didn't... I didn't look close enough below because I just saw the the pretty volcano and I was like, oh, that's cool. It didn't occur to me that it was actually part of what was going on in the panel that there was action in that panel. Yeah. It's it's pretty cool. So

206
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:07,945
the next sequence

207
00:21:08,403 --> 00:21:14,270
is going to be all about how Scrooge is preparing his money. Right?

208
00:21:14,884 --> 00:21:20,784
And and this is a long standing thing. This isn't a bunch of these stories. I really like this this

209
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:27,948
archetype of story where he's gonna do something to convert his money. In this case, he is having everything

210
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:29,385
changed into

211
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:34,906
one million dollar bills which, of course, is a denomination that doesn't exist

212
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:39,970
and placed into cans as though it is

213
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:40,967
spinach.

214
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:49,610
In twenty twenty two money, one million dollar bill would be the equivalent of eleven million two hundred ninety five thousand

215
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:56,611
so sixty four dollars and, like, twenty four cent. Yeah. So those are those are that's not lot to

216
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,345
me that. Right. That is no. Don't see that it.

217
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:08,359
Whatever that metaphor is. It it sounds like it would take one or two. Somewhere between one and two of those cans.

218
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,114
Would be about

219
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:17,185
Elon Musk or Jeff bezos is fortune by by that math. I'm thinking. Right. Yeah. It's a lot of money.

220
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:21,752
And and so it goes on to show that, you know, each of those...

221
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:25,234
The the the cans are then put into Barks

222
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:26,554
in boxes,

223
00:22:27,494 --> 00:22:38,003
and they're they're getting prepared to be shipped to Hawaii. And we've got this cool sequence here of donald kind of poking holes questioning

224
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:38,941
Scrooge.

225
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,060
Right.

226
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:45,618
Warren, do you wanna tell us about some of the the ways he questions Scrooge?

227
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:58,341
Yeah. You know, he's... It Donald is fascinated by this process, and it's it's the exposition is happening very quickly here from the spinach cans to his concern, of course, about the boxes will

228
00:22:58,774 --> 00:23:11,619
ship all the way to Hawaii, but he starts questioning screws about aren't two afraid of being robbed and then Scrooge just innocently says by whom, and and by pirates And here's this incredibly large number. U.

229
00:23:12,217 --> 00:23:30,979
Five hundred with seventy five zeros afterward. I don't know if you guys did your research, but I have been the name for that number. Oh, yeah. I I plugged into to a generator. I bet you did the same. Go ahead. Hit us with I... Is this warren... Before you do, is this the first time that we get, like, a named

230
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:42,237
amount of his fortune or Oh, no it happened in magic hour glass. I something more. It happened before, but I I just don't... I was so enchanted by this number. I know

231
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:47,650
and of course, the sixteen cents at the end. This Tidy sub is actually called Q

232
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,770
Vegan Ti. U u. That is the

233
00:23:51,150 --> 00:24:01,245
the the actual name for this number. And I don't even wanna to know what that is Sarah in today's dollars, because I like I don't think the world economy. So that was... That was just a great gag.

234
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:20,210
It got... It got I'm sure kids thinking about that's a lot of money and a lot of kansas spinach. But Donald, Donald Al challenge him a little bit. Then they look back and all of a sudden see this robot that he's... Or what he would donald thought things are work man in Ten sips. And screws just laps and says no of those are rented from the Ducktales

235
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:55,210
Institute of Science, they're real squares. And... But this is where the Nephews start getting a little suspicious even of them. Don keeps pointing out then as they are at the docks that what about the crew and the ship won't they talk. So Donald runs back and ready to pack for the voyage, you know, he's excited, but sc really gets gets concerned about all those little challenges that donald throughout. Yeah. I like I like the sequence how he starts out all confident and then he transitions into, like, paranoid because Donald has... I I mean, right fully been poking holes in it.

236
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:03,116
And and he starts to panic and he thinks that the one thing that he neglected was whether they didn't love spinach.

237
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:08,499
I like... I like his that he he imagine all of a sudden that they're just gonna be absolutely

238
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:09,435
raven.

239
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:11,066
For spinach.

240
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:12,081
They'll

241
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:17,762
They're more... Yeah. They're gonna care more about spinach than they are about

242
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:20,407
million dollar bills, and then gonna

243
00:25:20,744 --> 00:25:25,486
try to cook it. And this is after months of planning too, and so it shows it's it just Scrooge.

244
00:25:26,098 --> 00:25:35,623
Really didn't think of everything. And that theme kinda carries throughout this whole story. If you think about Scrooge just always a few steps behind and a lot of things and what we'll get to those Yeah. Because he often

245
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:46,770
see a slice of donald. Right. Because this is a Scrooge story. Right? And, Donald, Donald is a little in in the early uncle screwed stories donald is a little bit more rational

246
00:25:47,187 --> 00:25:49,537
and reasonable than he is and a lot of them.

247
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:51,365
Carrying over the life

248
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:56,278
the donald Inducks stories around the same time like Christmas for Shack.

249
00:25:56,697 --> 00:26:10,845
Mh. You know, which wasn't too long ago. I really... I love this next sequence because it has a line that I have used over and over and in my own real life One of my favorite things that Barks has ever written. So

250
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:17,066
Scrooge calls donald up in desperation telling him you've given me the jitter

251
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:37,050
get back down here right away, and and he wants Donald to sneak around and report if there's anything to suspicious before sailing time. And Donald says I would open my big mouth and get a job stuck in it. And for whatever reason, that line just jive with me I

252
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,890
love that saying and I I use time

253
00:26:41,645 --> 00:26:47,684
anytime the the situation fits, I... How always you say that. I would open my big mouth and get a job stuck in it.

254
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:51,712
Yeah. That's great. I love. I love this sequence a lot, and

255
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:56,221
it's the the spy donald now and and screws just absolutely

256
00:26:56,814 --> 00:27:08,866
loving his money. He's really materialistic here. You can really see it or never. Right. And and Barks gives us a a a hint Barks does something that he does sometimes. He includes this in ahead of time on the narrator box

257
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:10,598
saying that Scrooge

258
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:17,185
should look long at his money. As he's wall in it. It's going to be many weeks

259
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:24,840
before he sees it again. And we flash to Donald. Skull around, wondering if he hears the robot

260
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:25,860
whispering.

261
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:34,895
Alright. So you guys this next sequence. The next few pages are gonna be all about donald sk around at the voyage

262
00:27:35,315 --> 00:27:38,455
getting ready And and in short term

263
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:44,539
Donald is gonna figure out that indeed, the work men are none other

264
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,535
than the beagle boys

265
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:48,251
who have

266
00:27:49,244 --> 00:27:50,423
stripped the gears

267
00:27:50,762 --> 00:27:54,796
out of the robots and or disguise as them.

268
00:27:56,249 --> 00:28:04,326
And and you know, he he also discovers that he hears the crew talking openly about the money, which sets off alarms.

269
00:28:07,112 --> 00:28:18,361
And and I... Warren and Sarah, I like this a lot because this is like this is still a pretty early b boy story. But this might be the first, like, really

270
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:20,115
finalized

271
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,945
beagle voice. Right? They're they're basically

272
00:28:23,322 --> 00:28:23,822
now

273
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:33,466
They've got every aspect of them. I I think Warren, this is the first time he referred to them with their numbers all starting with one seven six.

274
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:43,093
That could be... I I was intrigued by the way they referred to each other Al, you know, b eighty and and that sort of thing. I've never seen that before. Maybe.

275
00:28:43,964 --> 00:28:56,170
But... But, yes, this is where you get the one seven six and then the variations after that And and and I can't keep count Barks and sarah about how many legal boys are actually onboard the show it but I... It could be that number five.

276
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:05,338
Maybe there a few more... Yeah. I feel like there's there's a decent number enough to, you know, captain and Scrooge the ship. Right. Right

277
00:29:06,195 --> 00:29:11,020
But, yeah. We've we've got a good number of beagle boys. Donald is figuring out that

278
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:16,820
everywhere he looks. It's not a robot. It's not a captain crew. It's all beagle boys.

279
00:29:17,578 --> 00:29:19,952
And we're we're meant to find them in imposing.

280
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:25,005
What did you think of them as Villa here, Sarah? I didn't think that they were as

281
00:29:25,705 --> 00:29:28,365
dynamic as what I was used to,

282
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:29,996
Inducks.

283
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:36,952
And I didn't think that they were as dynamic as they could have been in this issue.

284
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:44,540
I I feel like they felt flat They... Their one note was punishing the Ducktales with hard work and

285
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,660
with the, you know, undertone of being

286
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,620
g

287
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,620
criminal,

288
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,660
which

289
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,360
is fine. It served the story.

290
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:59,574
Yeah. So I'm not gonna complain too much. I feel like I used two so much better

291
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:27,775
characterization from Barks. Then I got from him in this issue. That's fair. I think a little differently, Sarah. And if you don't mind, I I I'd like to say think the where where we see Scrooge kinda fall here in his scheming to protect his money, the big boys are just the opposite. They've They've worked this entire plot to get on the ship to dress up like robots and to to... They the knew about the canned spinach. I mean, they knew everything based on their

292
00:30:28,313 --> 00:30:34,773
filtration, if you will. Now, yes, after that scheming that they did that that fell flat for Scrooge,

293
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:37,427
then I think they take over this criminal

294
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:39,077
kinda one note

295
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:42,106
men part that I didn't

296
00:30:42,443 --> 00:30:43,160
necessarily care for.

297
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:46,065
But Mark, you said it earlier. I think this

298
00:30:46,443 --> 00:30:46,943
story

299
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,613
puts the B boys into a

300
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,838
a strong featuring role. Where they really get to really see them

301
00:30:54,510 --> 00:31:06,820
come full circle. Yeah. I I think I think your criticisms totally fair. I I really like the characterization of them in this. I like that they're... Sometimes he's gonna have them be a lot more bumbling.

302
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,775
But in this one, they're very efficient they're great planners

303
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,890
They're usually really good planners. It's just that something usually goes wrong.

304
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:28,699
And and they usually make some dumb mistake after they've implemented their plan. But but in this one I like. They... They're really a forced to be reckon with. Because there's a lot of, like, they're they're not violent, but they're always in implied

305
00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:32,894
violence. Right? There's always the implied thread. They're obviously very tough.

306
00:31:33,273 --> 00:31:36,230
And and they're just there one step ahead of Scrooge,

307
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:38,903
I love this

308
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:41,439
setup that we're gonna get here,

309
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:44,137
how they low Scrooge into

310
00:31:44,476 --> 00:31:53,181
this false sense of security. I can't... I can't... I guess I can't gloss over the great moment Donald is is in goat aging and his skull.

311
00:31:53,815 --> 00:31:58,635
And he ends up getting himself. He he hides in the hopper

312
00:31:59,215 --> 00:31:59,875
that is

313
00:32:00,495 --> 00:32:05,690
casing up the Cans of Spinach, and he gets himself nailed into a box.

314
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:12,858
And and this is like our our cartoon logic. Here. Alright? Because that's like a death sentence for any regular human being.

315
00:32:13,675 --> 00:32:18,526
So that... That's a little stressful to me. But but it's a cartoon. So it's gonna have a great payoff.

316
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:24,005
A few pages down the road. I was a little stressed out by the accounting

317
00:32:24,383 --> 00:32:37,415
aspect of it if they had had ordered the right number the boxes for the specific cans of spinach that they had. They going to have have all of these extra Inducks. Has spinach at the end.

318
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:39,966
So that's where I had to just remind myself

319
00:32:40,383 --> 00:32:41,578
car watch X sarah.

320
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:43,770
Right. Right. Exactly.

321
00:32:44,304 --> 00:32:50,823
So, you know, Donald is out of commission. And I like the fact that he's he's off the page long enough to almost

322
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,715
forget that he's in the story.

323
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:57,157
Right? So we're gonna transition to Scrooge and the nephews boarding.

324
00:32:57,715 --> 00:33:06,368
Scrooge just feeling a little better because he hasn't heard from Donald, and he's supposed that he must still be talking around that he would have told him if there was any kind of a problem,

325
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:13,048
and the beagle are gonna do this great job of lull him into a false sense security

326
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:15,326
by just being the most obedient

327
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:17,324
respectful captain

328
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:19,881
crew, they give this snappy

329
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,670
salute and I click to their heels and say, I I, mister Inducks

330
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,187
every time they're told to do something.

331
00:33:28,186 --> 00:33:34,220
And and the post I... Barks, I think, rings some real great humor out of posing the beagle,

332
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,460
all in the exact same

333
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:40,706
manner. I really like this aspect of the story. And they

334
00:33:41,123 --> 00:33:44,696
lull him into such a great sense of full security

335
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:50,303
that he makes a tragic mistake and he waves off his postcard

336
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:51,621
protection

337
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:56,783
supposing that he won't have any issues from this fine

338
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,519
crew.

339
00:33:58,117 --> 00:34:05,768
This one, I I I bet you're right. Absolutely. That waving off the coast guard sets up the story for the the adventure to begin. But

340
00:34:06,264 --> 00:34:08,956
I I I look at the big boys and and

341
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:15,565
you you... They're certainly recognizable by face, but they cover up their masks with sunglasses and glasses and and

342
00:34:16,145 --> 00:34:22,720
And anyone else would see that these are the big boys. It is right. It's just so much fun watching Scrooge

343
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,480
love these guys this most immediate Scrooge that he's ever had.

344
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:42,571
And they love the fact that their scheme is working against Scrooge. So it's beautiful, writing and beautiful storytelling telling you. Yeah. And we've definitely got that trope that cartoon the Sky trope where the reader can see through it. I can't say that I'm opposed

345
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:43,543
to

346
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:48,005
this kind of section of the one percent

347
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,197
getting them to

348
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,708
trust you and then, like,

349
00:34:52,667 --> 00:35:01,988
taking their money, like... But, you know, I'm not gonna take it off for me and my be super done. You know, distribute it. Right. Scrooge

350
00:35:02,746 --> 00:35:05,080
is is only a hero because

351
00:35:05,816 --> 00:35:09,267
he's our protagonist, of course, any generic trillion,

352
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:17,300
you and I are not going to actually root for. I can only root for him and the guise of him being beam Scrooge Dot.

353
00:35:18,073 --> 00:35:30,125
Right. Alright. So the the story really accelerates here in a way that I find very sad fine. Right. Because as soon as he waves off the Coast guard, he

354
00:35:30,783 --> 00:35:33,500
directs one... He directs the captain again.

355
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:38,590
And the captain gives him the brush off. He says, go jump in the drink.

356
00:35:39,629 --> 00:35:44,499
And and, you know, screws is like a hu ass to me. What's going on

357
00:35:44,878 --> 00:35:45,777
and they...

358
00:35:46,636 --> 00:35:59,578
This this is really good payoff. Right? Because they've said I I mister Du every time. But this time, they say, you know, there's nothing that your cargo of spinach won't cure. Miss

359
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:04,942
Du and reveal themselves to be the b boys and Scrooge finally

360
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:09,249
recognizes him and he's in this situation where he's five minutes

361
00:36:09,985 --> 00:36:11,203
away from safety.

362
00:36:11,874 --> 00:36:15,244
And the beagle boys have completely taken over

363
00:36:16,618 --> 00:36:19,886
another thing that I love is bragging b Boys.

364
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:36,330
I love it when they brag about getting one over on him. In this case, they say, well, you know, we we bought this ship legally. We bought everything we did legally with the first canon of spinach off your assembly line. Yeah. The resourceful news of these Villa

365
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:44,865
is just great here. And I love the pan my favorite panel on this page is when they're all appearing inside of their cell they're just smiling and

366
00:36:45,364 --> 00:36:46,403
unfolding their plot,

367
00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:47,422
reminding

368
00:36:48,161 --> 00:37:08,725
screws. They are smarter than him and Yeah. Rubs it in and Yeah. I love the bragging deal boys too. That's that's a great story. Yeah. They've got what I can only call spinach eating green. They've got great bragging brand. It's it's awesome. K. So so they throw the docks in the brick.

369
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:13,196
And and what they're gonna do is they're recommend gonna keep going. They're gonna

370
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:21,082
head onward to Scrooge island because it turns out they like his plan. They just want to use it as their own hideout out,

371
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:33,571
they're height away as the previous title had Inducks indicator. And Scrooge starts yelling for donald, but the Nephews has remind him, you know, hey, they don't know about donald. So he's our only chance.

372
00:37:34,145 --> 00:37:35,645
We've gotta keep quiet

373
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:37,525
and they get to scheming.

374
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:40,645
And they realized that the kids can get out

375
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:46,432
through, like, a ventilator shaft. And so the kids have some time to kind of plan.

376
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:51,425
They they skim how to get the key to the bridge from the captain,

377
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:55,025
and inflate a little ref with a Al portable

378
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,520
air bottle.

379
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,800
And by and large, they come up with this really

380
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,540
ingenious for a comic book plan.

381
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:05,209
Right? I I like this. They

382
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:07,243
they recon

383
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,992
and one in the nephews is yelling for the captain

384
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:16,600
saying that his uncle Scrooge is swallowing his treasure map And

385
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,640
so when the bible it comes in to help

386
00:38:20,035 --> 00:38:28,006
Scrooge has hidden one of those air cans behind his back and he shove it in his mouth, phil him up with presumably helium

387
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,320
there's a little bit of common logic there. That doesn't really wash out. But... But it's it's a fun moment.

388
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:42,141
He's inflated and swelled up. They're able to get the key. They hop into the raft

389
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:47,382
and and Scrooge can't resist. Taking along just one crate of his

390
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:52,645
precious money. And and as they are just drifting

391
00:38:53,182 --> 00:38:56,567
into said like, almost into the range of safety,

392
00:38:57,064 --> 00:39:06,356
the beagle boys have spotted them, and they're training a harpoon gun at them. When one of you like to tell us about the... This great sequence

393
00:39:06,775 --> 00:39:23,522
because this is hilarious. And I if I gloss over anything you wanna... I know I'm I'm Well, this sequence is great because it is it is... It would fit into a cartoon and an animated cartoon too an extremely well. And yeah. Yeah. It's it is great. I'd love to hear serious steak kind though. It is very cinematic. So

394
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:24,359
so

395
00:39:24,935 --> 00:39:27,267
uncle Has taken that box.

396
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:33,002
They get on the inflatable rubber rafting, the Boys point, the,

397
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:36,214
and Donald

398
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:38,545
makes Al plea, not for his left.

399
00:39:40,036 --> 00:39:42,211
Storage makes the play. Right? Rouge.

400
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:47,754
I'm so used to... I know. It's mostly been donald for.

401
00:39:49,143 --> 00:39:55,112
The kids are doing such a good job, they're kind of in the role that I'm used to

402
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:58,106
where they are the problem solve

403
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,280
they're the ones keeping the cool head and calming everybody else down.

404
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,640
But this time, it's

405
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,620
screwed. It's a different uncle.

406
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,690
So uncle sp, please

407
00:40:10,148 --> 00:40:10,648
for

408
00:40:11,864 --> 00:40:12,364
the

409
00:40:12,942 --> 00:40:15,198
fifty of the box of money

410
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,116
and

411
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:32,310
The people boys think about it, they say open the box let's make sure it's not a trick. Spirit opens the box and groups. It's actually donald all. Which is you know, a good stroke of luck because he could have been in there forever, but not so good for the

412
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:37,850
motivating the legal boys not to shoot them with a harpoon apparently.

413
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,890
And then they do it.

414
00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:45,825
I was actually surprised about this. The... They get it through the first time,

415
00:40:46,225 --> 00:40:46,725
the...

416
00:40:47,185 --> 00:40:49,205
It puncture the draft

417
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:50,618
And then

418
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:53,490
the the Captain b boy is

419
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,046
floating because

420
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,655
the air that got

421
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:02,513
and and he inflated with the the air that was used on him. Yeah it's

422
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:03,567
on a rope.

423
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:15,886
Loading above everybody that great. We'll pick them up and make them work. Which I love in this comic that they, you know, they... It's in why that they're violent... The worst that they actually

424
00:41:16,503 --> 00:41:21,069
receive is just work. Let's go make them work. Right. Like, really grueling

425
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:41,176
work. Or and you gonna comment on on the beagle being held like Al balloon. Well, my for my favorite four panel sequences where we see donald fully out of the box, and his his word bubble is all in square too. I mean, I think Ga had a great time doing that. He just... The joke is is pun situated there.

426
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,607
The discovery have Donald the square and

427
00:41:45,146 --> 00:41:54,295
the next two panels and then the the the hard into the into the raft. But I just love the captain screaming as a balloon. I I think that's just one of the best sk

428
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:59,710
drawings of this... Of this story. And and wrapped up nicely there with with sort, like, now that

429
00:42:00,328 --> 00:42:04,753
conservative begins. Yeah. The this page is great. This page is wild.

430
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:08,841
I I wanna really dwell on what you were talking about

431
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:13,955
Right. That moment where where Scrooge is expecting to pour out a pile of cash,

432
00:42:14,475 --> 00:42:15,775
But instead Donald

433
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:19,830
falls out and he he has become like

434
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:25,790
cubic quebec and it's such a funny drawing because he is all right angles

435
00:42:26,104 --> 00:42:30,835
you can see him kinda unfolding gradually. It's totally ridiculous

436
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:39,985
and then that text balloon as you say, even the tax balloon is like, everything is square. It's so funny to me. And

437
00:42:40,522 --> 00:42:46,382
and it it's something you can only really do in a comment. Right? They're taking advantage here of of this medium

438
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,214
where you could show him fold it up like a square in a cartoon,

439
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:53,705
but you couldn't give it that little extra za.

440
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:57,094
Of making his very text speech

441
00:42:57,552 --> 00:43:11,668
actually looks square. But you can't do that in the animated cartoon. But this this this sequence really stood out to be as a kid. This just made me laugh and maybe. Actually wanted wanted be a cartoon to sit the time made before I get up? Brief nice.

442
00:43:12,164 --> 00:43:21,250
A brief time in my early life where I wanted to do this. Yeah. It's it's really funny. And and so, you know, the... This transitions us to the next,

443
00:43:21,588 --> 00:43:25,637
like, phase of the story. Right? We're gonna arrive at the island.

444
00:43:26,134 --> 00:43:30,436
And this is also the the part where the duct certain like real

445
00:43:30,813 --> 00:43:34,740
dr because the captain allude to it. We're gonna make them work.

446
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:40,175
And for most of the rest of the story this it's gonna be, like, almost exhausting.

447
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:50,516
As the reader you're gonna really feel or at least I really felt for the Ducktales. Because he goes out of his way to, like, really well on the

448
00:43:50,933 --> 00:43:51,811
the toy.

449
00:43:52,250 --> 00:44:05,247
Like you were saying sarah, I think it's a good stand for that kind of implied violence, which we expect that they are capable of if they had to, but they don't really have to. They're they're the out number them. They're bigger than

450
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:19,338
them and and it's still a kids common. And so the arrival is is pretty neat The island looks really cool. This is the part where we're really gonna get to dwell on the the the Florida,

451
00:44:19,954 --> 00:44:20,454
especially

452
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,928
of Hawaii

453
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,329
I don't really have a good feel for which of the background backgrounds Ga

454
00:44:26,746 --> 00:44:28,262
might have contributed to,

455
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:31,971
but it but it's really lovely. It's it's really nice.

456
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:40,931
And and the beagle boys you're just na about what a perfect setup they've got in this kind of hidden harbor that Scrooge had dr out

457
00:44:41,628 --> 00:44:48,441
and they're going out of there way to talk about how the Ducktales their servants now. And they've got a lot of work.

458
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:54,056
Had Al. Just a bit of comic art here. I I love the way that Barks depicted Scrooge

459
00:44:54,616 --> 00:44:56,056
top hat on top of his box.

460
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,969
Just a way to maintain

461
00:44:58,348 --> 00:44:59,207
his identity

462
00:44:59,546 --> 00:45:10,576
in... As they carry the boxes of spinach off the ship. Oh, yeah. You're right. That is a offensive of common Barks. So it looks like in this next sequence that we have at least a

463
00:45:11,036 --> 00:45:22,146
minimum count. For how many legal boys we have. As they are fighting as the uncles are fighting over who's going to actually climb the mountains was set off the bon fire

464
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,485
distress or whatever.

465
00:45:24,846 --> 00:45:26,866
That's right. They they

466
00:45:27,701 --> 00:45:40,656
Uncle Scrooge says that he watched dishes for thirty people boys. Yeah. So we've got... We do have... You're right. It's at least a minimum count. We've got at least thirty beagle. We don't usually see more than a half a dozen time.

467
00:45:40,995 --> 00:45:49,913
But we know this is a big family. And that night, we see the dots talking about how exhausted they are from all this work. And and Scrooge

468
00:45:50,431 --> 00:46:04,115
explains that he does have one good backup. Right? He's got He's got one measure. He's indicating that on the top of the mountain, the volcano, which is called Mona K and Me, So he he has stocked

469
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:08,542
the wood for a signal bon fire up at the top. And,

470
00:46:08,919 --> 00:46:12,226
you know, they argue over who should go up and

471
00:46:13,126 --> 00:46:18,626
and light that fire, you were mentioning Sarah, that they're kind of like, competing over who

472
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:23,008
have the most dr. And and it ends up being Scrooge.

473
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:29,585
And Warren, do you wanna tell us a little bit about the night hike that Scrooge has, this is a really pool sequence.

474
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:41,446
Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, again, it Uncle Scrooge is the the key figure here who gets... Who's know storm off or March off and and concord this mountain but Al he claims into the jungle and

475
00:46:41,825 --> 00:46:45,817
goes in there, and this is his first of a few attempts to go up to the mountain.

476
00:46:46,455 --> 00:46:48,193
He gets spooked a little bit here.

477
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:52,595
I I have heard of all the people cleared off the island, where are those voices,

478
00:46:52,973 --> 00:46:54,231
I think wild dates

479
00:46:54,608 --> 00:47:25,296
any hears and and the great artwork here. The silhouette of everything is his challenging his imagination to know in. The Barks sq, there's a horrible claw creature that grabbed my ankle and well certainly not a creature. We know it that we know that and this huge shadow of what he thinks is an elephant or a beast charging down on him He's gonna hide the shrub, but then mistakes the rubbery is a tang of giant fish ones, but he is completely terrified. His imagination has taken over and it dawn, he makes it back to the camp, and that's when he kinda

480
00:47:26,234 --> 00:47:51,336
Tells donald that take my shift for that that morning donald I haven't had a week of sleep. Not ask you've got to bite the beacon he goes no, and that will then chase me into the how tree, and it was all night getting back out. He had his imagination there, but he failed his first attempt to to go up to the moment. This is a really cool page. I think I I like it a lot. To me, this is like one of the ones that I remembered the most.

481
00:47:52,651 --> 00:47:56,064
You you nailed it. Right? It's really cool how Barks

482
00:47:56,202 --> 00:48:19,451
let's us see the ci silhouette, we can see what he's encountering but Scrooge can't. So we see it's just birds, you know, tackling at him and and so forth, as you mentioned. And we get this neat little taste of the of the Flo and fauna we learned that a how tree is a tree that that, you know, grows to be as large as, like, a forest.

483
00:48:20,424 --> 00:48:23,079
Where it looks... It's just it's this massive

484
00:48:23,936 --> 00:48:27,687
sn tree. And I'm I'm pretty sure that's a real thing.

485
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:33,396
Oh is. Yeah. It's a it's an actual native to the the islands. Yeah. Yeah. And and

486
00:48:33,815 --> 00:48:51,685
I don't know. It's it's it's a really cool sequence. As you said, it's our first attempt, It's gonna end in failure. I love the detail of the floor and Fauna as you were saying. Although, I'm not sure what it was that he thought was a beast. Like, obviously, we know it's not an elephant.

487
00:48:52,384 --> 00:48:58,982
Don't know what it is anymore than Well, we're gonna see it. We're we're gonna see it in the light of day on their next attempt.

488
00:48:59,779 --> 00:49:12,241
Right. We can presume that it's probably leaves, I think, most reader so like oh probably a big leave, but we can see how he would have mistaken it. I was actually a little bit frightened by it. I think that

489
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:19,759
walking at night is kind of a basic human fear. Oh, yeah. That that packed into mind, even

490
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:23,005
at at my age and

491
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:43,401
so, you know, not being as immersed. I was a little bit scared. I definitely agree. Right? Because even as a reader, I even though I can see what's going on, like, I can put myself Al Uncle Scrooge head space and be like, this this feels really creepy and and getting tangled on a vine as you're climbing up. That sounds spooky.

492
00:49:43,741 --> 00:49:48,851
There... There is one little aside that that's kind of casually mentioned

493
00:49:49,349 --> 00:50:01,246
that's really unfortunate. And probably the the the the aspect of this story that makes me win the most is on this page. And it is that first

494
00:50:01,985 --> 00:50:05,362
panel where he says I had all the people

495
00:50:05,996 --> 00:50:09,776
cleared off of this island. What are those lang or voices?

496
00:50:10,076 --> 00:50:12,456
Right? So that that is

497
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:18,574
I guess there's a lot of room for interpretation there. But Right this this is extremely colonial.

498
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:22,896
This is not a deserted island. This is an Island that had people

499
00:50:23,274 --> 00:50:28,682
living on it, and it's entirely possible that he relocated them under

500
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,838
circumstances that made them happy

501
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,186
But more likely, you know,

502
00:50:33,944 --> 00:50:35,801
in in the way of these things,

503
00:50:36,219 --> 00:50:36,719
their

504
00:50:37,177 --> 00:50:37,677
was.

505
00:50:39,292 --> 00:50:39,492
Right.

506
00:50:40,145 --> 00:50:43,360
Right. Right. This was kind of the typical treatment of...

507
00:50:44,057 --> 00:50:49,366
There there are a lot of conflicted feelings from, like, Native Hawaiian today.

508
00:50:49,901 --> 00:50:51,799
Many of them want their independence

509
00:50:52,458 --> 00:51:21,496
the... That part of the story hasn't aged well. There's almost no scenario that is like, good. In terms of what he's referencing here. I would glad you brought that up because the the the the first sentence is is pretty telling. I had all the people cleared off this island. It doesn't sound like something Scrooge would do or does it perhaps, but it does not hold up well. And right. I agree, I I hope that he have them relocated to another beautiful island, but the fact that he removed them from their home is.

510
00:51:22,073 --> 00:51:23,628
You just wouldn't see that today. Yeah.

511
00:51:24,601 --> 00:51:25,101
So

512
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:28,041
before we get to their second attempt,

513
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:30,901
we get this inner inter load

514
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:40,057
And and again, this is a part I really like. The story has gotten into this kind of like, it's it's almost not even... I don't know. It's if it's very lang.

515
00:51:41,051 --> 00:51:48,771
Almost like it's it is a vacation even though the dots are clearly under some registry here. We we cut to the beagle boys.

516
00:51:49,305 --> 00:51:50,443
Who are

517
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,312
reading up on on the on the islands

518
00:51:53,689 --> 00:51:57,237
and it's kinda funny that they're interested enough to learn about it.

519
00:51:58,091 --> 00:52:00,771
But they're very concerned about what goes in their tum.

520
00:52:01,171 --> 00:52:03,391
So they they have read about

521
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:05,731
mu being the surprised fish.

522
00:52:06,265 --> 00:52:07,085
Of the islands.

523
00:52:07,822 --> 00:52:11,056
And they learned that the fish which are called

524
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:15,941
Mama are caught in shallow bay and title Gladstone.

525
00:52:15,941 --> 00:52:18,117
And so they they yell at the nephews

526
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:21,350
to go and catch them some mama. And the nephews

527
00:52:21,928 --> 00:52:24,703
go down to do just that, but they're

528
00:52:25,255 --> 00:52:26,193
they don't know,

529
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,185
you know, what to do.

530
00:52:28,522 --> 00:52:37,865
They they can't... They can see the fish, but they have no idea how to catch them. And this is when they are gonna encounter our new character for this story.

531
00:52:38,383 --> 00:52:40,058
He's a really interesting guy.

532
00:52:40,736 --> 00:52:41,635
Named open.

533
00:52:42,546 --> 00:52:58,036
Sarah, what do you think about openly league? I think he's a little bit calm for being the last remaining person on the island, and I think that that is a little bit of a disservice. Maybe a lot bit of a disservice. To our perception as readers

534
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,686
of the culture of hawaiian.

535
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:14,171
Right? Because it's he's he's passively accepting what's gone on and he's still, you know, happy to make friends with the kids and and tell them about how the, you know, how to catch fish and and and the

536
00:53:14,589 --> 00:53:17,604
be the... It's like a... If it wise

537
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:20,213
throat went indigenous.

538
00:53:20,671 --> 00:53:27,977
Yes. I think I've heard it as the friendly native trope. Okay. Right. Yeah. Because he is definitely that stereotype. Right?

539
00:53:28,949 --> 00:53:49,468
And and here, I think you're exactly right. He's very calm and very passive for essentially an apocalypse has happened to him. Right? Everyone he knows and Lu has relocated Al left his home. He is the last of his of his nation has tribe to be there, and he he it's a very pate

540
00:53:50,245 --> 00:53:52,676
depiction. Right? Because he's like, very happy.

541
00:53:53,373 --> 00:53:59,502
But but at the same time, there are some nice things about this representation of him, I think. I was feeling.

542
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:08,893
I'm gone like, I was curious It he says he is called the old timer, and then he goes with the others when Mo hi by our island, what does Mo

543
00:54:09,525 --> 00:54:10,025
Male

544
00:54:10,641 --> 00:54:43,836
translate to because he was referring to Scrooge. I think that's foreigner. I looked that up, like ages ago. And my memory, it means poor. Okay. Because we also uses How, which is what white people if I recall correctly? Yeah. But also think this is where Ga really really put herself into the story with the education and the background on Hawaii. You know, she put the Al at into the book that the bigger boys were reading. She Mo is is a stranger. Sorry. Interrupt No. No. That. That's good to know because this is all Ga

545
00:54:44,256 --> 00:55:06,671
doing, I think. This is the education. This is the background. And this... I think it's done rather respectfully and it's Gladstone in good taste. And... But, yes, under the circumstances, his he is just enjoyed of watch and I just love the drawing. Yeah. I I think you're right, like under the circumstances. And with the added relative to the is the time, Barks is going for, like a very nice

546
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:11,220
respectful. We like this character. He's very helpful. He's very

547
00:55:11,957 --> 00:55:16,699
warm. He's very kind. It it it's definitely like a very pate

548
00:55:18,112 --> 00:55:28,245
representation. There's no getting around yet. But... But he at least has some agency here he's decided he's not... He's an old timer. He doesn't wanna live this island believe this silence.

549
00:55:28,624 --> 00:55:32,735
Hi this this next sequence is pretty cool. Right? The kids are meeting Op,

550
00:55:33,234 --> 00:55:35,053
and he is teaching them

551
00:55:35,392 --> 00:55:42,421
this really cool thing, which is real, you know, how you make these title fish traps

552
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:54,396
by creating damn that the fish get get trapped in when the tide goes down. I don't know about you warren, but I loved learning about this as a kid. This was...

553
00:55:55,416 --> 00:56:12,997
This really satisfied me Al the young reader. Same here. This is this is why I think I liked the story so much or at least so why I liked it so much and appreciated it when I was a kid because I learned so much about this culture, which I Severino existed and some of the the teachings and the the history. Right.

554
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:17,151
And and they they learn a little bit more about

555
00:56:18,011 --> 00:56:20,591
this this native this local Hawaiian

556
00:56:21,424 --> 00:56:22,164
and an

557
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:24,415
wee. Sarah, what does that mean?

558
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:34,440
He claims it means big tummy, but I'm skeptical because we also have the island being called what keep a new.

559
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:39,665
And it it feels like I I want to know more. Did you look it up, mark??

560
00:56:40,343 --> 00:56:45,128
I I know enough about Hawaiian and Poly languages

561
00:56:45,745 --> 00:56:47,243
to know that they

562
00:56:47,781 --> 00:56:58,092
they make a little do a lot. And I don't mean to generalize about about these languages. But like... And they have a lot of words which are used to which which are common.

563
00:56:58,586 --> 00:57:01,818
A tummy could be a mountain. Right? They're they're all mount.

564
00:57:02,656 --> 00:57:04,194
So I'm thinking it's probably

565
00:57:04,692 --> 00:57:10,073
context whether it means belly because if you Google translate it, yes, op

566
00:57:11,048 --> 00:57:12,843
translates to Big belly.

567
00:57:13,362 --> 00:57:16,353
And and this is it that makes sense so.

568
00:57:17,207 --> 00:57:24,187
And this is a neat little thing. Right? Because another aspect of Poll culture is that a big belly is

569
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:27,638
is like a status symbol. It is

570
00:57:28,014 --> 00:57:31,942
is a sign identifier of someone who is higher status

571
00:57:32,279 --> 00:57:40,286
and so this kinda trap with him being like a village Al. Right? He refers to him himself being a long timer who didn't wanna leave.

572
00:57:41,046 --> 00:57:45,252
So while it might seem like a way that he's poking fun at him,

573
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:53,647
this is probably something Gary told him. Yeah. The chief often or the the people with the biggest Al. That that's my thank.

574
00:57:54,485 --> 00:57:56,781
I always appreciate your

575
00:57:57,399 --> 00:58:13,020
linguistic background. Now Yeah. Not a little bit of anthropology there. Too. And warren, I just thought of this right now, but Barks is gonna go back to that kinda of concept in the status seeker many years from now, right? Where

576
00:58:13,478 --> 00:58:13,978
where

577
00:58:15,372 --> 00:58:17,712
a big tummy is is

578
00:58:18,012 --> 00:58:27,447
recognized as a status symbol. That's right. Looking forward to that one. Alright. So we transition back to sp and Donald who are just

579
00:58:27,907 --> 00:58:28,407
dr

580
00:58:28,746 --> 00:58:52,252
Al at the dishes, that never ending dishes and Sp is having a really hard time of it. He says he needs to be rescued soon. Donald pope said him says you better not see any more elephants on your way of that mountain. And I sense the Donald knows, it's ridiculous that there being no elephants and and on small islands. And so Scrooge and Donald are gonna make the attempt number

581
00:58:52,552 --> 00:58:57,732
two. To scale that mountain. And they do see in the cold light of day. That

582
00:58:58,232 --> 00:58:59,292
the beast

583
00:58:59,752 --> 00:59:00,252
was

584
00:59:01,045 --> 00:59:01,545
elephant

585
00:59:01,923 --> 00:59:05,936
Barks. And I think that's actually the name of that plant.

586
00:59:06,474 --> 00:59:10,342
It is. We have elephant Barks on our deck. Yeah. Nice. If it's

587
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:27,399
it's a nice plan it's beautiful big Barks. And I knew right away it was an elephant deer, of course, but it's neat to see it f. Isn't that cool? Did you get it because of the bark connection? No places is my wife loves gardening, and she's the she's the green thumb here and that's fine.

588
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:41,582
And and this sequence is really funny. I I like this. They decide that they need to gather their strength. So basically going up the mountain and they They keep sampling the local fruit. And they eat a mess of mango

589
00:59:42,277 --> 00:59:43,296
and lava

590
00:59:43,992 --> 00:59:48,778
and and they're just They and they it, and they're absolutely

591
00:59:49,277 --> 00:59:52,113
nauseous by the time they summit it the mountain.

592
00:59:52,832 --> 01:00:05,337
It's it's silly. It's one of those bits of sell so sabotage that I find very funny. Yeah. They self just a good way to put it. I I just thought it was hap to come on guys. You're you're trying to get out of there and you're eating.

593
01:00:06,356 --> 01:00:11,983
I was glad it was as inn as overheating. And not that they mis

594
01:00:12,561 --> 01:00:19,182
the fruit and we're causing self greater payroll. Yeah. It's just a bit of ridiculous Let me

595
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,714
very funny. And and so by the time it's the B boy's lunch lunchtime,

596
01:00:25,433 --> 01:00:41,355
there are no cooks to serve up the Visuals as they say. And one of the big boys Hall Donald and Scrooge Barks. There's this funny moment where he's like carrying them each day in one hand kinda reminds us of how small the Ducktales as characters.

597
01:00:42,146 --> 01:00:49,797
And he he found them up the mountains side too sick to work. And so the another beagle goes to identify what's up with the kids

598
01:00:50,111 --> 01:00:52,167
and he catches them only halfway

599
01:00:52,505 --> 01:00:53,364
through building

600
01:00:53,981 --> 01:01:13,873
a damn. And so he chases them with a switch ordering them to make some lunch and then come back and catch some fish. And there there's this moment where we see the Nephews looking very miserable. Yeah. You're right. They... The nephews are rejected. And they they just wish that there were somebody

601
01:01:14,187 --> 01:01:41,157
there to help them. And we see this dialogue box narrative the Barks that just kinda of revealed for the first time this mystery. That most sooner do the boys pass this ancient wall than the flower part and the sound of running feet goes along the Moss stones. I just love that reading that as a kid. Because my imagination was running wild now. Yeah. And we see these little eyes amongst those flowers. We have a hint that there's another mis mysterious

602
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:51,214
force here. Oh, man, if I had read this Al a kid, I would have found any wall with flowers I could and looked for. Little

603
01:01:51,593 --> 01:02:00,532
that would that would be nice to me. Yeah. That's exactly right. Kids kids eat this kind of thing up. Right? Little little no, little fe little

604
01:02:00,872 --> 01:02:05,652
little faye, two creatures that only kids can see and encounter.

605
01:02:06,032 --> 01:02:09,544
And this next part is a neat little payoff. Right? After

606
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:22,767
some dr, the kids, they're already exhausted they returned to work on their damn and they find that they are completed. And the kids see fish flop around all over the place. It's a it's a cool moment.

607
01:02:23,186 --> 01:02:24,046
Meet artist,

608
01:02:24,585 --> 01:02:29,450
and They asked both N if he did it. Here's is an expression

609
01:02:29,867 --> 01:02:36,722
poo poo which I think I it means crazy. Am I going crazy or something like that. Because he's very confused,

610
01:02:37,062 --> 01:02:43,495
and he tells them that there's only one way that this could have happened he has explains that Mo

611
01:02:44,192 --> 01:02:52,290
laugh at our believes, but we hold Connie know who builds And he's using, like, very pigeon speaking English that I'm not gonna

612
01:02:52,867 --> 01:03:06,571
reproduce. You know, he he uses me instead of I and so forth. We old Connie who builds walls like magic, the tiny ones. Men who And, of course, in Real Hawaiian, there's no plural s at the end.

613
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:10,468
And he explains that they are little connie,

614
01:03:11,141 --> 01:03:25,678
little men that did things like build the wall that you see here that keeps the island from sliding in ones And there's a little bit of reference to kind of the overall legends that you you must... You probably imagine Ga must have

615
01:03:26,017 --> 01:03:34,704
informed this part. Right? Oh, yes. And in fact, Op new is is referring to the other islands of the Hawaiian chain to Kauai Oahu,

616
01:03:35,057 --> 01:03:37,797
you know, I think it's wonderful. Yeah. It is neat. It's

617
01:03:38,257 --> 01:03:39,757
a little bit more of the mystery

618
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:44,257
explained. And I liked the moment when the kids return.

619
01:03:45,271 --> 01:03:55,206
I love that one vehicle asks, have you done fit kids caught any fish yet and they come back dragging one of those elephant ear leads? Just teaming

620
01:03:55,625 --> 01:04:01,892
with fish and they get to sm say, oh, yes, One or two. So next day, we get

621
01:04:02,351 --> 01:04:05,780
Attempt number three, we see Donald and Scrooge

622
01:04:06,338 --> 01:04:11,682
Gas we their way up the mountain. This is the first time that they get to the signal fire.

623
01:04:12,575 --> 01:04:25,220
Waiting to be lit. And this is a silly trope, but I love it. It's still funny. Right? What what's gonna happen in a comedic a comic book when characters struggle to get to a signal fire Inevitably,

624
01:04:25,717 --> 01:04:27,334
they don't have any matches.

625
01:04:29,205 --> 01:04:37,117
There is a little Scrooge play on this. Right? Donald like, no. This is this is your idea. I don't have any matches. Use your own.

626
01:04:37,651 --> 01:04:38,151
And

627
01:04:38,846 --> 01:04:43,730
and Donald says, you mean to say, you climbed all the way up here and didn't bring any matches.

628
01:04:44,186 --> 01:04:45,457
And screwed says

629
01:04:46,317 --> 01:04:49,657
Well, after all, they cost a penny a box.

630
01:04:51,357 --> 01:04:56,042
Very typical Scrooge being the cheap scape and putting himself and more peril. But again,

631
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:06,442
a third attempt did not work out as well. Yeah. And and then there's a great cap to the job where where he says maybe we could start a bla by rubbing to sticks together.

632
01:05:06,779 --> 01:05:09,848
And and as a tropical rains storm,

633
01:05:10,662 --> 01:05:14,782
And sue Donald says you could start one with my blood pressure.

634
01:05:15,342 --> 01:05:17,302
That's a great joke. Rachel deal.

635
01:05:19,237 --> 01:05:24,697
It does feel like... It feels like their roles are reversed from what I used to with

636
01:05:25,651 --> 01:05:27,828
Donald being the one frustrated

637
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:41,258
with Scrooge mess up. Yeah that's a good point. And and it also occurs to me that March just really revel and putting them through through some bad times in this one. Mh. So

638
01:05:41,732 --> 01:05:53,741
we transitioned to the beagle boys and one of them has like seen Scrooge and donald through his spy glass, and they're laughing at this attempt to light a fire in in a rain shower.

639
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:57,793
Until the other b boy realizes is they must be

640
01:05:58,132 --> 01:06:00,188
attempting to light a signal fire

641
01:06:00,902 --> 01:06:02,562
And so they they go

642
01:06:02,982 --> 01:06:03,482
to

643
01:06:04,142 --> 01:06:09,102
stop them and catch them. And the Nephews user sent to catch more fish.

644
01:06:09,596 --> 01:06:29,473
And this is the low point. Right? Because the Nephews are putting putting it together. They're realizing that this is... But basically our last chance now that now Scrooge and Donald are caught, the beagle boys are gonna be keeping them really close eye on us. And again, they pass by that flour wall and we see those little eyes.

645
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:31,906
Mh. Are only hints

646
01:06:32,324 --> 01:06:33,741
of of their chance.

647
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:34,659
So

648
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:38,704
we then transitioned to them engaged in some more dr.

649
01:06:39,881 --> 01:06:44,786
And and one of the beetle boys, here's some loud noises that sounds like shooting.

650
01:06:45,524 --> 01:06:51,770
And we get this really cool visual that honestly, I I like the visual, but there's so little payoff

651
01:06:52,108 --> 01:07:01,262
or there's there's so little lead up to it. Mh. That... I always forget... Oh, yeah. There's a volcano here, and this is gonna end with this

652
01:07:01,776 --> 01:07:07,424
it it feels like a cool element that other stories he might have built up to more. Because

653
01:07:08,081 --> 01:07:13,245
we see the volcano is spewing these cool rings of smoke.

654
01:07:13,724 --> 01:07:16,180
And it's just an neat visual. And

655
01:07:16,837 --> 01:07:19,147
Sarah, why don't you tell us about open louise

656
01:07:19,646 --> 01:07:20,744
explanation. O

657
01:07:21,202 --> 01:07:24,455
said that it was the min hoo who were

658
01:07:25,113 --> 01:07:33,895
making that happen that they were throwing rocks into the crater to make the mountain match. Now I'm not gonna say that I actively

659
01:07:34,553 --> 01:07:40,881
predicted this. But there was something in the back of my head, especially as a lover of volcanoes.

660
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:52,042
Right. And that it was kind of like a checkup fa volcano. Right? Like, you don't put a volcano in one of these stories unless it's going to erupt in somewhat.

661
01:07:52,657 --> 01:07:53,957
Right. Yeah. I

662
01:07:54,257 --> 01:07:56,677
did predict this. And I'm

663
01:07:56,977 --> 01:07:59,317
glad that it was erupting in

664
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:09,659
a way that was favorable to them. Know, this is such a nice story where I just like nice things how happening. Right? Like, even when the bad things are happening,

665
01:08:10,036 --> 01:08:24,184
right there than night, we're doing nice things for them, and the volcano is even being nice in a certain way. Yeah. You like to see it turn out well considering all the the suffering that the doctors have been through. Right. Now I did wonder

666
01:08:24,616 --> 01:08:25,116
keep,

667
01:08:25,854 --> 01:08:26,354
open

668
01:08:26,734 --> 01:08:29,551
claims that that means big cigar mountain,

669
01:08:29,969 --> 01:08:32,481
and that feels like such a

670
01:08:33,378 --> 01:08:37,070
phrase? Yeah. Looks that one for. Chic

671
01:08:39,044 --> 01:08:39,544
blinds

672
01:08:40,095 --> 01:08:43,842
sink r. He is the Hawaiian word for cigar.

673
01:08:44,639 --> 01:08:52,042
Also means cigar in addition I love it. Love Look at that, he generally got everything right on this,

674
01:08:52,882 --> 01:08:53,382
including

675
01:08:53,761 --> 01:08:57,376
the fact that volcanoes can blow smoke ring. U.

676
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:14,088
And that's... Yeah. And and again, thanks to Ga for for her contributions here because this this... I thought he actually made up big cigar mountain. And I didn't look it up like you did. It's wonderful that that keep a means bull. Yeah. And it's it's apparently a very rare

677
01:09:15,143 --> 01:09:19,568
occurrence. But even as as most recently as the mount Ae option.

678
01:09:19,942 --> 01:09:21,602
They they saw some,

679
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:25,162
like, hundreds of meat of feet large

680
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:26,522
smoke rings.

681
01:09:26,982 --> 01:09:32,357
The blown out of of Ae is not cool. Is very cool, like intermittent eruptions. So... Yeah.

682
01:09:33,237 --> 01:09:55,052
Yeah. I will say that the shape of this volcano is completely inaccurate yeah. Type of lava that happens at the hot spot that has created the Hawaiian chain? But I'll it slide. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Alright. So the b boys is panic. Right? Because they they figured this is likely to attract attention

683
01:09:55,630 --> 01:10:02,110
And so they've gotta load up all the the cargo of money along with the Ducktales. How we get this really neat

684
01:10:02,447 --> 01:10:06,177
suspense race against the clock where the Ducktales

685
01:10:06,096 --> 01:10:07,357
have to load it

686
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:19,251
and and the beagle are rushing to get it set up and and head to another islands and finally, it's all loaded up and they are only waiting for the tide

687
01:10:19,592 --> 01:10:23,063
to be high enough to leave this harbor. And the nephews

688
01:10:23,722 --> 01:10:27,956
think that they've figured out their one shot their one remaining chance.

689
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:50,966
Warren do you wanna tell us about what the nephews used do? Yeah. The Nephews, I think it put it all together now. So they dive off the ship, and they said we'll we're gonna just get to shore and and tell them you know somebody that can stop the ship and who well, we'll find out. So they they dive in the kids are swimming back to shore. The bigger boys take advantage of that, but Scrooge finally

690
01:10:51,383 --> 01:10:55,743
finally gets the better of the big boys and the boys Barks

691
01:10:55,863 --> 01:11:00,133
screaming by the wall yelling by the wall. The many who wherever you are, please help us.

692
01:11:00,691 --> 01:11:01,191
So

693
01:11:01,609 --> 01:11:02,961
they believe in them they've

694
01:11:03,419 --> 01:11:04,677
you know, listen to the legend.

695
01:11:05,173 --> 01:11:16,571
And as the boys are are yelling the big... The B boy turns again on donald and Scrooge. Kind of a awful looking panel there with ripping them by their next. Mh. But

696
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:29,746
but get back on board you brad and so they... The boys having done their, I guess their appealed to the Men who jump back on board. And so the the Bigger boys think, they've got it free and clear now, but they really don't. Yeah.

697
01:11:30,706 --> 01:11:35,726
You're right about that kinda unpleasant looking panel. Right? Because there there's a lot of good...

698
01:11:36,866 --> 01:11:49,868
Gets some more violent. Here at the end with the eagles hauling out a shotgun and my life Scrooge just very actively her at moment where he just butts him right in the belly, not the shotgun gun out of people's

699
01:11:50,446 --> 01:11:53,700
head. But, you know, he was really gonna shoot at them. And

700
01:11:54,437 --> 01:11:54,937
so

701
01:11:55,371 --> 01:11:55,871
the...

702
01:11:56,171 --> 01:11:57,291
As you said,

703
01:11:57,851 --> 01:11:58,351
warren

704
01:11:58,651 --> 01:12:01,851
things finally turn around for the Ducktales

705
01:12:01,691 --> 01:12:02,911
as the beatles

706
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:08,469
realize the instead of the tide coming in, it's actually getting shallower

707
01:12:08,926 --> 01:12:09,426
and

708
01:12:09,962 --> 01:12:18,338
mysteriously a wall of rocks is rising from the sea like a damn fencing them in, and we see a coast guard ship

709
01:12:18,756 --> 01:12:20,533
coming in the distance.

710
01:12:21,405 --> 01:12:21,905
And

711
01:12:22,402 --> 01:13:11,822
so we learned that Scrooge gets all of his money back and the beetle boys, go to the poke. We're informed by a narrator box. And we see Scrooge making plans to... You know, he's lost his taste for this attempt to keep his money safe. So he's gonna take them back to doc. I just wanna comment on that one panel. It says so much. It's just a great panel. It's not big enough to be a splash, but you've got the rocks thing cost in the air, you know something's happening. You got the ship on the horizon. The three nephews are standing as as the know the heroes of the day. Yeah I just love it. This is a classic Barks art and and writing style it's so much going on and you see resolution here. Right. Hey I love that. Sm look on the Nephew face. And so the story wraps up that this is... This feels very touristy.

712
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,945
To me. Right? There's the cli of, like, tourist who

713
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:20,889
arrive in Hawaii. They're given given lay of flowers

714
01:13:21,466 --> 01:13:22,843
Suddenly, the docks

715
01:13:23,221 --> 01:13:27,489
realized that they have lays around their next. Mh. And the Nephews

716
01:13:28,067 --> 01:13:31,924
explaining that they think it's... It was the... It was many who

717
01:13:32,503 --> 01:13:34,061
who put the delays on.

718
01:13:34,914 --> 01:13:37,727
They explained that they're the ones who built the wall.

719
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:41,517
Very quickly, they kinda wrap up and and

720
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:45,603
explained to their on pulls, and they realize at the end that, hey, you can actually

721
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:47,838
see them in the mirror

722
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:51,486
because they're visible when they don't know and anyone looking.

723
01:13:52,506 --> 01:13:57,606
And and this last panel is just so, like Hawaiian legend

724
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:04,014
Hawaiian. What do you... What do you think that the closing Sarah? Do you wanna tell us about how it how it concludes?

725
01:14:04,752 --> 01:14:06,546
Sure it has open

726
01:14:07,244 --> 01:14:27,250
in the, you know, the behind the tree, and you kinda get to see how big he is compared to the minute Who who are distance we, there's more on and... There are a couple around some elephant ears and they're much smaller. They're hiding behind the ears. They're on the shore. They're all over. There dozens of them with little colored flowers.

727
01:14:27,867 --> 01:14:29,763
They're waving and smiling,

728
01:14:30,301 --> 01:14:33,448
what is even swimming. It's just so colorful

729
01:14:33,864 --> 01:14:38,110
too with the local laura. Mh. And then you see some music

730
01:14:38,447 --> 01:14:42,034
kind floating of across the top that has the famous

731
01:14:42,373 --> 01:14:43,732
Hawaiian song Yeah.

732
01:14:44,611 --> 01:14:48,287
The... It's it's... You know, if you hear it, you'll think Hawaii immediately.

733
01:14:50,218 --> 01:14:50,718
Aloha.

734
01:14:51,216 --> 01:14:52,633
I think it's how you

735
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:58,673
Huey,

736
01:14:58,753 --> 01:15:00,466
yeah. Got it. Very nice

737
01:15:00,845 --> 01:15:03,146
up. I looked it up and it was written

738
01:15:03,486 --> 01:15:10,161
by queen Lil corona who was a famous swing of Hawaii before it was

739
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:11,641
completely

740
01:15:12,021 --> 01:15:12,740
by the Us.

741
01:15:13,836 --> 01:15:21,136
And it was written in the late eighteen before. So already this was a famous song that was associated

742
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:22,151
why.

743
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:24,951
Yeah. That... That's...

744
01:15:25,331 --> 01:15:58,390
I like your description. It's very colorful. It's very warm. It does not feel like a typical Barks ending to me. What do you think Lauren? No. I I I agree. I... First of all, the last page reviews the men who for the first time. Yeah. Last panel, last panel and even the explanation with the mirror, which I love in the final panel is a mirror image, you can see the green trim. But I I find this extremely... And and I I say this as a kid who read this who remembers this panel really, really well. It was very sweet and satisfying.

745
01:15:58,849 --> 01:16:21,551
It was almost, like I said, we now see the the mysterious little people. And and to me that was just fun, but very rare to be exposed like that and then the story done. Yeah. It's some... It always struck me as a little bit of a pot and I mean, he had to reveal them. Right? We had to see them in the way the volcano had to go off, I guess.

746
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:47,871
But but it it's it's a little sap here than most Barks endings in a way that I'm not entirely satisfied by. But I do like the story a lot. As an adult, I would agree with you, but as a child, I just was captivated by it. So I think I'm I'm this is one of those generations must past and I must get older, you know, and see about fifty years go by before I really see that. Yeah. It's a bit of a a postcard

747
01:16:48,171 --> 01:16:51,651
from Hawaii ending, you know, it's to to pat bad story ending.

748
01:16:52,211 --> 01:16:55,791
But, again, I think he did this at a time in his life when he was

749
01:16:56,425 --> 01:17:04,267
And I'll say this, I know we're gonna talk a little bit about our final thoughts, but I he was happiest happier than ever now. He finally found happiness in his life with Da

750
01:17:04,779 --> 01:17:13,785
and she contributed to the story, and I think this was just kind of a message of love for her as well. Yeah. I think that's right. Right? That's why I call it kinda like a honeymoon

751
01:17:14,126 --> 01:17:22,821
story. You can sense that he just was having a lot of fun. So... Yeah. Go and tell us one what what are your overall thoughts?

752
01:17:23,421 --> 01:17:26,321
Yeah. And looking at it much later in life,

753
01:17:26,821 --> 01:17:29,574
it does have the feeling of a happier

754
01:17:30,393 --> 01:17:30,893
story.

755
01:17:31,871 --> 01:17:38,614
And and you and I were talking earlier Mark about some of the critics out there online who are maybe talking about this not being a satisfying story.

756
01:17:38,952 --> 01:17:41,845
I disagree in a way on the other hand

757
01:17:42,222 --> 01:17:45,971
when you look at the golden helmet when he was probably at his lowest,

758
01:17:46,624 --> 01:17:50,012
and what he came up with, which just like what a few years earlier. Mh.

759
01:17:51,009 --> 01:18:04,412
I think you've got two very very different stories two very different motivation. So I guess I would ask is it true that Barks was more more of the genius and his writing in a story telling when he was at Al lowest? Or

760
01:18:04,886 --> 01:18:05,946
what was he finally

761
01:18:06,286 --> 01:18:12,746
able to express what he wanted to when he was at his highest in his happiest. So I I find these two stories very contrasting.

762
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:42,872
But I as much as I enjoyed the Golden helmet, I found this one just a happier story in in general. Yeah. Isn't it nice that we can get both kinds from him. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing I noticed in the story of we're not for the men annuities this was one of the few stories where the Inducks and gen ingenuity did not take over and save the day, it was done by the fairies by the Men who by the right. But these people is that's that's... I think a little more rare a a day ex min. Mh.

763
01:18:44,028 --> 01:18:51,772
Right. Nice. I did you say that that warren, it does make the story and the legal boys

764
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:53,586
a little bit more men.

765
01:18:54,166 --> 01:19:00,106
Right. You know, we... I I never thought about it. What if there were, no such thing as many

766
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:17,748
what if they arrived in a place where there weren't admitted hoo? Mh They would... They have gotten now this. Donald couldn't even get out of that box. By himself. And and who knows if the... If the other Inducks would have found him My catastrophe brain is going what if what.

767
01:19:18,698 --> 01:19:24,902
They would have been good sucks he did a really good job, I think. I I like seeing characters

768
01:19:25,438 --> 01:19:32,621
in in hardship. You know, I I I find that really appealing. I like. I like the aspect where they're really

769
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:45,615
under a lot of deprivation in in this story. It's something we don't get to see a lot of their... They're just carried along by events in this. And and that's the part of this story I. And I really like the mechanics

770
01:19:46,154 --> 01:19:49,025
of it. You know, just the the way that Scrooge

771
01:19:50,062 --> 01:19:54,989
identifies. His plan and the b boys talk about how they t him and and

772
01:19:55,700 --> 01:20:02,421
we get the explanation of, like, the fish traps I I feel like that this story has been just really well

773
01:20:02,878 --> 01:20:21,940
executed really well set up and engineer. But I didn't get your, like, kinda overall thoughts, sarah. What did did you enjoy this one? What did you think of it? I thought it was pretty good. I felt like it wasn't as dynamic And yet now that we go into it a lot more, I see... I see a little bit more of the depth to it.

774
01:20:22,954 --> 01:20:24,153
Despite the setting.

775
01:20:24,512 --> 01:20:31,939
I felt like there could have been better art, right, going through and thinking about what my favorite panels

776
01:20:32,318 --> 01:20:51,940
were. Mh. I was predicting that I would want to say, oh, this one with the Floor. Oh, this one with the special flowers, and they're just weren't that many. So the the art serves the story for what it was. But the settings set my expectations is a little bit higher than I think sure were appropriate.

777
01:20:52,240 --> 01:21:04,668
I could see that. I I will say, I think considering the, like, colonial nature of this story. It holds up a lot better than it could happen. Yeah. Right. Like he

778
01:21:05,007 --> 01:21:06,166
went into this.

779
01:21:07,099 --> 01:21:15,715
I really wanted to celebrate hawaii. Right? Yeah. It's an especially got. Oh that point. Yeah. Yeah. There's deaf at least some like pate

780
01:21:16,053 --> 01:21:18,192
elements and and the the whole

781
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:23,606
moving that happens off the islands we talked about why that's a problem.

782
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:32,561
But... But ultimately, this is a good it's well still problematic. This this was made with the... I think, very good intentions.

783
01:21:33,295 --> 01:21:34,034
At least.

784
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:44,317
I really like this as a showcase for the B boy. I feel like this might have been one of the first adventure stories that I ever read that feature to vehicles.

785
01:21:44,736 --> 01:22:37,150
It really sets up the history between Scrooge and the Big Boys well. Yeah. It really set some up. Yeah. They feel like a real force in this one to be rat. So I I like this one, I I think it's impossible for me to, like, disconnect it from how I felt about it as a kid, which is to say I just loved it as kid. I loved the setting. I loved the mechanics of it I think it has as an adult, I think it has some extremely sharp writing. I think it wraps up a little bit too hot. It's a little bit savvy in a way that isn't very Barks like, but I do think it's nice to get to see these different kinds of stories. So all in all, I will say it's not like an all time favorite of mine, but I I view this one great kind very. Very warm. I like this. Where was it Inducks Barks? Yeah. That's it. Great transition warren.

786
01:22:38,028 --> 01:22:51,030
This one is very highly regarded on dot This one right now as of today is it's an eight point one out of ten, which is good for number twenty out of all, you know, forty

787
01:22:51,530 --> 01:23:00,156
one or two thousand stories. I think that it probably stands out and keep memories because of the the very memorable

788
01:23:00,614 --> 01:23:29,251
setting. I don't I think that that is a very generous rating personally but I get why people like it. I would agree. I I would agree. And there are a few great gigs in the story that that stand out. The square donald is my favorite panel. Of all Yeah. And and the writing in there. So... Yeah. There there's a lot to really like about this one. You know, I always thought warren that it was shame, there was never any painting or lit graph associated with this one Nope. This one did not. Earn internet honor.

789
01:23:30,103 --> 01:23:34,830
Unfortunately, I think it would have been a wonderful painting and lit. Yeah. And

790
01:23:35,287 --> 01:23:49,080
to my knowledge has never been adapted in, like, Ducktales or anything like that. Alright. So you guys... This one has some pretty cool panels and we've talked about a lot of them, but we haven't really formally set our favorite.

791
01:23:50,012 --> 01:23:52,785
Warren, do you want to go first?

792
01:23:53,641 --> 01:23:55,058
Again, I... The story

793
01:23:55,595 --> 01:24:15,580
was with me as a young boy, and I and I remember some of these panels so vividly. I'll say the first splash panel, the opening panel with the slide projector and the the image of the island brought me into this incredible fantasy world And as we go through, I think the other memorable panel early on in the story had to be a little bit of the spinach

794
01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:45,081
explaining the canned of money. But I think the first glimpse of the robot kinda took me by surprise and that that that That was great when donald points to them is work men and tin suits. And then I think my favorite panel I may have mentioned it before was donald coming out of the box. And that little sequence there. And my final... My my my favorite, like, panel sequence would be that that first attempt by Scrooge to break off into the jungle

795
01:24:45,979 --> 01:25:05,640
with a lot of silhouette in there in a lot of darkness and Severino to me that was just a fabulous sequence. Those are really good choices. I I largely largely am gonna echo what you say. What about you sarah? My favorite was when the men luna, we're building the rock to trap the legal boys and the duct. Mh.

796
01:25:06,597 --> 01:25:10,830
But it was it was a really great visual just seeing the floating

797
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:40,406
rocks. Right? Like, it it wasn't revealed until the next page but they were always around. He just couldn't see them. I had thought maybe, like, oh, they just do things behind your back But no. They're truly invisible. So these floating rocks above the c wall were great. And then if you zoom in, you can see that maybe shipped that they were worried about And I'm sure that, like, I I don't know shifts, but I liked the detail of it that it was far off and vague and yet very specifically

798
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,980
naval at the same time. Yeah. That's quite and skill. Yeah. Those are those are

799
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,260
really good choice. That is a really

800
01:25:48,574 --> 01:25:56,266
I think Warren mentioned that that one's really action packed. Right? Again, for my favorite panels warren almost completely covered them.

801
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:20,870
I would be remiss if I didn't mention the volcano blowing the smoke rings is really cool. I really like that seen where Scrooge is bud his head into the beagle boy, making him lose his shotgun. I think that one's pretty great good dynamic movement there. And then uniquely for this story, a lot of my favorite panels have more to do with the tax.

802
01:26:21,364 --> 01:26:28,225
Because as I mentioned, I love that. It's not really a joke, but to me, it reads like a joke that that line of donald

803
01:26:28,779 --> 01:26:38,305
saying I would open my big mouth and get a job stuck in it. That works for me because of it his expression, but also because of the writing And and then

804
01:26:38,805 --> 01:26:48,392
the square text Al Donald is is all cubic. That always cracked me up. And and then just the overly long digit

805
01:26:49,249 --> 01:26:51,026
describing Scrooge is fortune.

806
01:26:51,364 --> 01:27:11,842
It's It's it's only tax but but it's funny seeing that in a word. Yeah. Good call on that. Yeah. And we forgot about one of the panels that we all left at and that was the Helium and the be yes. Yeah. Love that one... Oh, and and I I have to mention I love that panel with the nephews

807
01:27:12,355 --> 01:27:13,355
calling the the.

808
01:27:14,235 --> 01:27:20,574
I think that is a great one. I love their triumph and expression and the big pile of fish and how resourceful

809
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:26,712
they've been or probably open knew we told them, you know, pull it on this elephant ear.

810
01:27:27,549 --> 01:27:30,739
Yeah. Some really cool visuals, some great writing in this one.

811
01:27:31,993 --> 01:27:47,526
Again, not like an all time for me, but but it's just just outside the range. Yeah. Of of the all time great stories in my book. You guys have any closing thoughts? I'll just close with this. It's the only time you'll hear this word on any podcast

812
01:27:47,984 --> 01:27:50,100

813
01:27:51,234 --> 01:27:51,793

814
01:27:52,792 --> 01:28:01,736
Alright. So thank you guys very much for joining me. I have a new thing by the way. I have stroke of genius. I never really

815
01:28:02,073 --> 01:28:09,911
figured out how to close these episodes out. Going forward, I'm gonna close them out by saying what's written on the last panel. So

816
01:28:10,583 --> 01:28:19,635
I would encourage everyone to get in touch with us if if they have any thoughts, you can reach out on Instagram or the Facebook page, or remarks,

820
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:44,800
That's it's really the last two panels here. I'll be dogg on el or something. They're singing two. A song I know.

821
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:48,335
