and I also

4
00:00:57,401 --> 00:01:07,009
enjoy spy thriller. They're not my favorite genre of all time, but we have a very special story to talk about today. And in keeping

5
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:19,987
how special this story is. I'm trying something new I have both a newbie guest host. And a veteran guest host. To join me today to talk about dangerous

6
00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:44,145
disguise. So I... I'm gonna ask I'm gonna ask each of them to introduce themselves and, you know, let us know if you do enjoy spy thriller, and maybe if you've got a favorite. When we start with our veteran. Hey, Mark, It's Warren Harmon back again. Glad to be here on this very special program today. Yeah. I'm like Al longtime Barks collector and Donald duck van

7
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:59,247
can't stop collecting that the the duck stuff. So having fun with that. And yes, dangerous disguise prompted so many memories of my fast nation with foreign and t and international Spies. And yeah, I'm a I'm kind of a a longtime

8
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:04,808
fan of two genres, one would be the the classic James Bond Saga

9
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:15,315
which which Ian fleming started to write with Casino Royale one year after this book was written. The other is alfred Hitchcock and his wonderful

10
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:30,412
what I would call his English years when he was in Britain, and my favorite favorite story of all is the thirty nine steps. Nineteen thirty five, classic spy story. So yeah, thanks. This will be fun. Ops and how about our newbie? Hi. I'm Sarah Santiago.

11
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:32,770
I'm your resident

12
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:35,207
Jack Ball trades

13
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:36,566
knowledge expert,

14
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:39,980
and this week. And this episode I'm coming

15
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,420
at you as your resident

16
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,700
Spain expert.

17
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,875
However, I am not any kind of expert

18
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:50,955
whatsoever at thriller at spy, anything

19
00:02:51,855 --> 00:03:03,801
there just... I remember when there was double crossing and triple crossing, and then I just got so lost in, like, what, like, I think like the second pirates of the Caribbean.

20
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:07,848
And I was just like, what is going on. So

21
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,182
even this woman was, like,

22
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,408
slightly confusing to me. Intentional with it. Excellent.

23
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:25,043
I thank you both for for coming back. You're definitely the the stories that have some intrigued, they they require you to pay pretty careful and attention.

24
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:40,160
I like how Barks kind of lamp prune that a little bit in this one. I mentioned that I like spy throw. I do. But I kinda quietly like them. They're never really one of my favorite genres. You know, I I enjoy a good mission impossible,

25
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:53,249
I enjoy a bond movie, but I've usually rather watch something else. You mentioned casino Royale Warren, that one is like very reminiscent of this story. Right? In a way that's kinda surprising because it did...

26
00:03:53,629 --> 00:04:03,293
It it came out after, even the original version of it. So it's in nineteen fifty two. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's interesting to me that a lot of my cultural

27
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:04,131
touch

28
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:23,898
when I think about this story, came way later the the bond movies, the the mission impossible movies. You're right. It's it's more of the, like the the old hitchcock thriller that I think he was lamp and referencing in this one. I'm trying to remember what Barks so Cloak and dagger, I think. There's a great legacy

29
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,427
of these

30
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:32,562
spy thriller in in movie and book that I'm largely not familiar with but they're so like ingrained in

31
00:04:32,954 --> 00:04:33,932
the pop culture

32
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:42,546
subconscious. Then everyone knows when they read this. What Barks is is both celebrating and making fun. And and that knowledge

33
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:47,662
cross this generation. Clearly, right? Because Mark you're in my generation,

34
00:04:48,119 --> 00:05:13,319
new and warren generation new. Absolutely. There are no boundaries here. I mean, there are there are different... There are different approaches to the international spy story. But Barks was caught up in a time. One of the things I love about our podcast here is that Barks, we get to talk about the time he wrote it. You know, this is right at the beginning of the cold war, right at the beginning of Mccarthy right at the beginning of he's a communist. No she's the communist centers that

35
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:28,184
pointing the finger out everybody. It was it was suspicion going on. There was paranoia going on and he captured that in this story in a in a kind of a fun and wacky way, but also was able to really point out the themes

36
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:29,264
so eloquently.

37
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:33,399
Yeah. That that's really well said warren. Because you're right. This is like

38
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:36,319
with this funny version of Paranoia

39
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,454
that really had to reflect the the world. We're we're only a few years

40
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:53,329
from the dropping of of the bombs at the end of World War two and we're well into the beginnings of the cold war here. We have all of this frantic

41
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:54,684
atomic espionage

42
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,694
that had to be really

43
00:05:58,034 --> 00:06:07,349
consuming the headlines and and that everyone would have been steep in, and I bet it would have felt like it came up all of a sudden, right? Because the world was

44
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:19,476
preoccupied with the second world war, and then we almost immediately switched gears. Into the cold war. And I was I was interested in knowing what was going on you know, historically.

45
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:23,203
And This was... He wrote this like a few weeks

46
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:29,205
before the arrest of Julius Ro. Do you guys know the Ro Barks the trial.

47
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:35,645
So I I don't know that that specifically informed him, but this would have been, like very relevant

48
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:56,220
in the news. Right now. And was it was the time in the country where we were dis discussed was actually unfortunately, of your neighbor of who's that person down the street it had that again, that cold war tensions. And I tell you, I have to give Carl Barks a lot of credit he. In this my opinion in this story for many reasons we'll talk about

49
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:22,421
exercised fierce independence and said I'm gonna tell this story by way. I'm not gonna let my publishers tell me what to do I'm gonna say it. I'm gonna draw it, and I'm going to lamp pun it. And I I just thought that was a wonderful take that he had on this. And it probably one of the reasons it's a highly rated story as well. Yeah. That's true. I feel like it should be known that I have a cat on my lap and I'm padding it very

50
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:23,891
miss doctor

51
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:24,909
Ish.

52
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:29,254
Oh, yeah. In the manner of the bond villain like, well originally.

53
00:07:29,671 --> 00:07:34,617
Oh yeah. You're you're be very sinister looking there, Sarah. It's very interesting.

54
00:07:35,315 --> 00:08:13,000
Thank you. That's the look I'm going for. Yep. So Warren you you mentioned it. Right? This one is very highly rated and very well remembered by fans. And and when I have these stories coming up that are like landmark Barks stories, I get really excited to do them, but I also feel a little bit of the pressure. Right? And so I was like, this this seems like a great one to get these two different perspectives on I also feel a little bit guilty because I don't I really like this story, but I don't love it like a lot of fans do. I think it's not like one of my all time, favorite Barks stories. But but I think I definitely

55
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,495
get why it's so well remembered. And and why it's so well appreciated.

56
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:28,030
Sarah, I'm I'm curious, you don't have to, like, tip your hat completely. But what what are your kind of initial impressions on this one. Do you do you feel it like lives up to that

57
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:28,990
reputation?

58
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,293
I can't speak to everybody else's taste and standards. But for me, this was the first, like,

59
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:36,630
straight

60
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:37,986
actually

61
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:39,022
enjoyable.

62
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:45,790
I didn't even feel like it was problematic in any way. So it was actually one of the first that I

63
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,810
enjoyed. Just kind of at the level it's supposed to be enjoyed.

64
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:53,358
So I can see how people without the barriers

65
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:58,108
and and the and the tastes and the, you know, like, social

66
00:08:58,566 --> 00:08:59,066
justice

67
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:04,066
types of brains like I have. Could really like it. Yeah. I'll just

68
00:09:04,403 --> 00:10:05,146
in your in our messaging about this mark. You were like oh, it's one of the last where he had humans in it, and and I was like, oh, yeah. The... It's it is kind of Huey,. It is kind of weird to have humans in it. But like, that aside. Like, okay. Yeah. This is this is quite enjoyable. Yeah. That's so cool to hear. I'm glad you got. And I realized too, I've been having you come along for some of the episodes where I I need to process some of this stuff, so that may not be fair. But I think I'm making a point too every once in a while having you join for just just a noteworthy and enjoyable episode. So so good. I'm glad I'm glad you enjoyed this. That'll be fun to talk about. What about you warren? Do you do you think this is, you know, lives up to the reputation? You know I I... It's not my favorite story either. However, I know why I think I know why it has such strong appeal among the fan base. And I think it's sara so nicely put it. I think there's a cinematic quality to this story. It's it's it's like a movie

69
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:08,230
and it it plays like it. And that's when he wanted. You know

70
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:11,022
intrigued. There's not a lot of

71
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,900
controversy

72
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,691
there, except when we get into some of the...

73
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:17,222
Maybe Thomas Andre andres thoughts about it,

74
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:49,323
which might be classified as controversial and the fact that Barks editors didn't like this story. But I think it it serves the reader well as a thriller as a kind of a comic thriller. So to me, it was in net vein of if at the time the abbot costello movies were the buy movies and the... Because there are some slaps sticking in here as well. I think because it's so different from all of the other Barks stories for this. What is this four color three zero eight, I think. I believe he's kind of breaking some new ground here and I think the fan base said, hey good for you. Yeah.

75
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:56,748
Again, very well, said, and it it feels like some of the appreciation to me might be almost in hindsight

76
00:10:57,127 --> 00:10:59,080
that he didn't really get to do this

77
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:05,673
anymore. You know, it's like it's like he used up a lot of his juice and a lot of his goodwill. And then he got

78
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,645
restrained a little bit. And it's not that he couldn't do

79
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:25,982
Obviously, he's got some of his greatest works coming up, but he really had to work within the limitations. He he edged right up to the line and he figured out where it was and he had to pull back a little bit. So let let's go ahead and talk about a bit about some of the backgrounds

80
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:30,936
of this story. We've definitely gotten into some of the cultural stuff already. Dangerous

81
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:39,440
disguise is in nineteen fifty, late nineteen fifty, you're correct it was from four three zero eight in the United States.

82
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:41,511
It hasn't been

83
00:11:41,850 --> 00:12:00,237
reprinted as much as you might expect seven of them in the states, including the original and this is a twenty eight pager so it's on the longer side, but not as long as some of were. And we mentioned it already, but it's very notable that this is the last story that Barks gets to do that really

84
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:05,960
prominently feature. Human characters. Right? Here and there, he'll like sneak them in in the background

85
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,560
or whatever. But

86
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,655
but it's almost entirely humans and the ducks in this one. And

87
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:20,990
there there have been a few interviews about this with Barks. You know, There's some good source material that where he shared that he loved

88
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:29,060
drawing humans. And if he could, he would love to have done something like the old comic strip prince val.

89
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:33,806
I was gonna say I didn't read it growing up, but the lavish artwork, the realistic

90
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:37,080
depictions of people, that, like and Steve Cannon,

91
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,078
the other

92
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,290
adventure comics series, I think were

93
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,930
inspiration for Carl Barks and and you're rightly the the interviews clearly

94
00:12:46,510 --> 00:13:00,736
expose his love for doing this. In fact, he started to work at a comic strip with live action characters and because of his pressure deadlines from Western Publishing and everything. He had to abandon that strip. And so his his true love was to was to

95
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:24,855
figure out a way to continue the drawing of the human figure. I think for his stories. And of course, you know, you Barks, we go all the way back to about nineteen twenty eight when he left California to come to Minneapolis. Yeah. Definitely that it's it's impossible not to talk about his work with the calgary eye opener when you when you think about this story. And and the Calgary eye opener...

96
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:30,915
I love the name of the publication. It's so evo. Right? Because... Because it really was. It was these

97
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:47,885
Sarah, I think I sent you at least at least one or two images from the Calgary Eye opener. So... I thought this was like it sounded to me like some kind of a ride at a world fair or something. It doesn't sound like a publication and all. Yeah.

98
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:56,001
Well, it does have a very unique publication. And and basically, what was it more in into the into the late twenties?

99
00:13:57,651 --> 00:14:09,050
Started in the twenties and he was recruited to Minneapolis where they published it in twenty eight and stayed there through thirty five and almost became editor of. He was like the staff the cartoon

100
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:29,705
for it. Yeah. Yeah. He did it. He draw over the one page... The one panel gag that... Two panel gigs. He ended up because the staff was so incompetent there at the eye opener. His work ethic, which I think he got a lot of training there to do the output that he did in his, you know, formative years is those... And I think he just... Yet became... And it was a girly magazine. Let's.

101
00:14:30,563 --> 00:14:58,790
I mean, it was a humor magazine where he wrote the gag. He sketched the gag with these roaring twenties, flap women and men and Dapper looking, but they all had an an edge to it. Yeah. It was... It it was a girly magazine. And it was obsessed with sap basically as much as you could be as much as you could get away with in the late twenties, you know, it looks a little bit it definitely looks tame maybe on the edge of R k. But but there are numerous

102
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,070
jokes that are double ent tons

103
00:15:01,862 --> 00:15:03,736
regarding sex of all kinds.

104
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:05,472
It is absolutely

105
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:10,337
focused on a lot of his drawings. Some of it's just like silly

106
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:14,297
Scrooge ball humor, right, about people's work ethics

107
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:15,213
and

108
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:23,889
lamp pruning pop culture of the time. But a lot of it is really making fun of the the male gaze, the male

109
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:48,982
fascination with the the female form. Right? So there There are lots of very loving detailed drawings of figures that should remind us of Mad Triple act. In this. Right? So so if you you're very familiar with Barks and his early work, that's what My Dom Triple x immediately reminds me of Y, yeah. Those the... Think... Absolutely.

110
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:58,344
Also from the Hollywood, we talked about how Gladstone was based on Joseph Cotton. I think Madam triple x but there's a little veronica lake in there too. Yeah.

111
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:02,707
Patel is his they call it. I did have a question

112
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:08,424
about Madame triple x was triple x Did it mean the same thing

113
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:10,298
as eu

114
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:12,425
back then as it does

115
00:16:12,925 --> 00:16:16,385
today, like, as a as an illusion to

116
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:23,036
sexuality or or sexual material, don't think it did. I think that that became...

117
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,032
I think that that became a convention when the

118
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:28,405
the motion pictures

119
00:16:28,824 --> 00:16:32,659
association adopted the x rating, which was like, into the... Yeah.

120
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:56,448
Sixty early... Yeah. Started than sixty eight. Yep. So so triple x became, like over the top way to basically label it as porn graphics. So no. It's it's that's that's a good question. It's not supposed to make us think of any anything like that. We're deaf... I think, you know, we're definitely supposed to recognize her Al like warren said fe fatal, a very su looking woman, Barks

121
00:16:56,926 --> 00:17:18,865
clearly re drawing her. Yeah. And gotten trouble for it a little bit too for too much of the female form. And again, I have to give him credit for his fierce independence. He said I'm gonna do it and he knew he was turned it in after his deadline. He couldn't go. They couldn't go back. So I guess he got swat on the on the back of the hand for that one. Yeah. So so let's talk about that moment. Right? When when he went to his editor.

122
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:25,524
From what I gather, he he completed this one a little bit closed. A deadline, which probably

123
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:56,658
gave him the leeway where they felt like they had to publish it because there wasn't really time to do to do any kind of a revision. So so he took and I'm quoting from a nineties nineteen seventy one interview that Michael Barks did with him. He said, as soon as I took dangerous to disguise in and Karl B took a look at it. He said that doesn't go good having real humans. It takes the Ducktales of their world. And after that story humans were rarely used again. And

124
00:17:57,717 --> 00:18:02,027
also told him that, you know, He's really butting up against Western publishing

125
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:03,265
strict

126
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:04,623
against

127
00:18:05,202 --> 00:18:06,715
showing people in a section

128
00:18:07,372 --> 00:18:19,254
provocative manner. It was gonna be a few years before like, the comments industry got cracked down on a couple years later, they would never have considered doing this. Everything was sanitized

129
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:23,684
much tame, but but B famously had him

130
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:38,362
reduce the bus. Of a female character in one of his very first stories. Life life card Donald, I think, Warren. I think there was it was Al early comics and stories. Wasn't it. Yeah. Yeah. I think it was called life days or lifeguard guard Donald.

131
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,952
It was you have to to go back in the red

132
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:52,522
the bo if you will or the bust of the the Ducktales figure. It was the Duck character. So the... you know, the fact that she has memories and that is is is pretty uncomfortable as it is. But... Yeah.

133
00:18:53,838 --> 00:19:05,397
But, yeah. This is a situation where he he got away with what he could and and then B are basically gave him the the guidance, you know, never again, and and he never did, unfortunately.

134
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:25,935
I I've got a hot take though. I I think B was right. I think I think it does take me a little bit out of the story. And I I think it's it's to the stories benefit in in this case. Right? Because it does make the... It does make all those characters feel very mysterious.

135
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,705
And jarring, but I don't know if I would want to see it in all of his stories.

136
00:19:31,264 --> 00:20:11,235
Going No. This was a this was kind of a refreshing break for me, but only this time and maybe maybe if if the storyline called for it, but, no, I think this was a great one and done kind of thing. Yeah, I don't wanna give b too much credit because I'm not a big fan of most of his covers. He did. He did a lot of early covers. He didn't... He did the Goody Goody stories feature during the little bad wolf, you know, the son of the big bad wolf I actually do enjoy those, but I I think Think that's his lane that he should have stayed in. Let's see, Boy. Lot of background trivia, but I don't I don't wanna dominate the conversation. Anyone wanna chime in really quick before I catch my breath and and talk about

137
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:14,185
Triple x more. I think the other

138
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:25,861
inspiration for the story, which I read doing some research mark and and Sarah was The idea it apparently came from an unused cartoon to idea from nineteen forty. Called Madam

139
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:34,479
Double. Apparently, that got scrapped. If you think about it nineteen forty was when Carl Barks was working Al his

140
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:47,991
story man. Yeah the Disney studios and he was working, you know, on the shorts. So it makes you wonder if he came up with that idea. I don't have much more on that mark do you? Yeah. So you're exactly right. You know, this is based on that

141
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:54,349
used short. And from what I read, I found a website that that referred to some of these shorts

142
00:20:54,889 --> 00:21:05,997
and and he was heavily involved in that one. Like, he conceived a lot of the structure of it. It it would be neat to think of, you know, a short a short cartoon with Donald chasing

143
00:21:06,374 --> 00:21:11,950
Chase. I like this. I I kinda went down the Rabbit hole and had fun looking at some of the

144
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:25,105
un produced Disney shorts. Some of them would have been awfully fine. Yeah. The only the only other thing that I really did wanna to mention is that one of the most iconic things, I think about this story is it's

145
00:21:25,565 --> 00:21:29,638
fantastic cover. Like, I I love that cover it's obviously

146
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:30,756
recognizable

147
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:34,028
to fans because they used it in the

148
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:39,948
Carl Barks library, the big lavish publication in the early eighties. That was one of a few

149
00:21:40,445 --> 00:22:20,357
that got to, like, a adorned the front of the hard covers. But but it stands out. I I kinda feel like when I finally got to read the story, I I kind felt like it doubt it over played how much of it's about bull because that's that's what I felt like I was sold to expect but a lot of love for this this cover. You know, I have to almost disagree with that. I i I'd like the cover, but I think it it it was a safe cover. It was just a a panel or two in the story. So it it it certainly makes sense when you read the story and you get to the bull ring, but I was hoping for a little bit more of the spy thriller in espionage

150
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:27,030
themed to come out in the cover. So to me it was okay. Oh, but then you would have had to put humans on the cover.

151
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:48,475
Yeah. Then then the secret would have been revealed. Listeners can't see me, but I'm leaving as far back from the screen possible because I don't like the idea of more humans. Yeah. It's it can be a little jarring. I don't know. There's something about his pose that looking back over shoulder It's a great pose and mostly balanced visually.

152
00:22:49,068 --> 00:23:06,567
It's it's so well balanced visually. Right? You have... It... It's it's swoop from the bottom left corner up to the top right as he's like, kind of stretching over to the side, but holding up the the red cloth. I don't remember what that called. And then

153
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:07,899
kind of counter

154
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:15,059
that down over to the left is the bull looking angry and and of course, donald looking very

155
00:23:15,414 --> 00:23:33,616
scared as he is want to do. It's very striking in the use of color in the in the balance. I I agree. I really liked the coat the cover. Yeah. I it's got a great composition. I I agree warren that it doesn't. Set up the story. I like i when disagree though. It's it's interesting.

156
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:41,997
Well, yeah, I I i again, I didn't... I never kinda sold me too and you did too on the composition. Aspect of it. It makes for a great intriguing

157
00:23:42,615 --> 00:23:48,090
cover and you'll wonder what this is all about. So I that actually did kinda hit me as well. So for sure.

158
00:23:48,943 --> 00:24:04,738
So let's let's pan to our international audience a bit guys. We've we've got some of the the titles from around the world. I'm gonna... I'm not start off by mentioning what it's called in Germany. This one is Ga,

159
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:06,811
dangerous

160
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:08,062
game. Mh.

161
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,692
Warren, why don't you give us one? I'll do Brazil. This one's

162
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:14,603
kinda straightforward, but it's Aj,

163
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,520
Secret

164
00:24:15,977 --> 00:24:16,655
the secret agent.

165
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,886
Sarah. In Italy, it was

166
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:31,515
Donald and the Atomic Spy. Awesome. And then probably the most interesting one to me is in France, it was once called

167
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:46,692
Tom say, deceptive appearances, which sounds like, like a cinema synapse thriller alert to me. Yeah. And then Sweden is far for Glad. That's a straight up translate. Not dangerous

168
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,310
disguise.

169
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:58,405
Great. Okay. Spain, Mexico, this Spanish speaking countries has also got it. I will I will do the Spanish d since they are

170
00:24:58,903 --> 00:25:00,100
ostensibly in Spain,

171
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,952
which is another dangerous

172
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,227
disguise or a dangerous costume.

173
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:15,755
Awesome. Thank you, guys. I love the English title. It's a great bit of Al. You know, It sounds it sounds very intriguing. I like it too. Alright.

174
00:25:16,095 --> 00:25:26,765
So we we already talked about my little sequence where I like to go over the cultural historical Barks. The only thing that I wanted to add is that we are three years after

175
00:25:27,144 --> 00:25:27,644
the

176
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:33,975
creation of the Cia in nineteen forty seven. And then out of the manhattan project,

177
00:25:34,355 --> 00:25:36,975
I think there was there was so much espionage

178
00:25:37,355 --> 00:25:40,629
that was hitting the the news stands. Over the

179
00:25:41,088 --> 00:25:48,061
the atomic rivalry rate between the Us and the Soviet Union that that's that's what really captured a lot of the popular

180
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:57,075
imagination We've got a couple of very notable appearances. They're not gonna appear again in the comics, but we've already mentioned Madame Triple x

181
00:25:57,695 --> 00:25:58,195
a

182
00:25:59,507 --> 00:26:04,474
What miss miss Georgia Ko was it? Vi poland. Yeah. And

183
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,508
and then Don El.

184
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:07,624
Yeah.

185
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,072
Rest rest in peace.

186
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:15,220
Oh, you know, I I didn't even mention that as part of the, like, significant background.

187
00:26:15,877 --> 00:26:16,736
Didn't talk

188
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,350
deaf and dying.

189
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,350
This is

190
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,630
this is one of the most gruesome,

191
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:36,838
you know, of of his stories. Like, there there is more deaths it's all off panel. It's all off Scrooge. I I guess if you really wanted to to stretch it, you could argue that no one really dies because because you don't see it, but...

192
00:26:37,177 --> 00:26:39,036
But there are some almost ina

193
00:26:39,495 --> 00:26:46,440
violent deaths in this one and and gun play and and even a depiction of a suicide or attempted

194
00:26:46,817 --> 00:26:51,385
suicide. So this this is a pretty dark story while also having

195
00:26:51,882 --> 00:26:52,382
having

196
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,216
that comic edge

197
00:26:54,530 --> 00:27:12,413
Sarah, Or you were you surprised to see that? I I was I was very shocked not so much about the you know, these people are very disposable along the way. Right? We're just... We're so used to that. We have our marvel movies and hen, bad guys, under.

198
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:21,278
They get thrown off the sides of ships search whatever. We never know whether they make it all the time. Right. And then this one,

199
00:27:21,695 --> 00:27:22,554
the guy

200
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:27,021
decided to throw himself off of a building

201
00:27:27,358 --> 00:27:28,576
out of a window

202
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:32,102
That that was a little bit shocking.

203
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,693
We don't see that so much. Or was that

204
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:36,550
necessary?

205
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:44,176
Let alone kind of acceptable for that time period. Am I looking to add it through twenty twenty two eyes?

206
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:48,046
I mean, I think you could argue that. It it was definitely

207
00:27:48,385 --> 00:27:53,280
shocking. Right? And I I will get to it, but I think it's really supposed to be an indictment

208
00:27:53,793 --> 00:28:05,871
of a certain country and a certain leader really, Know? Because he does it because he he knows what is going to happen to him in his home country, which is a a thinly

209
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:11,055
veil analog for the Soviet union. So that that's what what

210
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:23,163
Is going to do, and it's upsetting because he looks like Donald too. Oh. Yeah. It's right going he his fe he very dramatic, but didn't wanna face the consequences of going back. Yeah.

211
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:29,863
Let's do it, guys. This we we've got some great stuff already to say about this. So so dangerous

212
00:28:30,362 --> 00:28:33,739
disguise opens with this great establishing

213
00:28:34,118 --> 00:28:35,058
shot and

214
00:28:35,557 --> 00:28:39,305
narration box that shows the Ducktales ad the scenery

215
00:28:39,722 --> 00:29:00,450
of the French riviera. This is like one of their first real visits to Continental Europe. It's a great setup. Apparently, they've they've ticked off their uncle sc because he paid them handsome to get out of town. And that's how he kinda hand waves that they're in this very exclusive place. And so they are ad

216
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:08,458
a beautiful beach they're looking at all the very rich people around them, the Nephews are kind of a go and we're getting this great

217
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:10,815
rundown of all these characters

218
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:15,061
he's listing off gambler and gold digger and black,

219
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:28,264
and then he mentions that you also see spies. He he says that there are probably half of the spies in the world slit around here, passing their secrets. And and this is gonna really

220
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:29,919
animate the Nephew

221
00:29:30,497 --> 00:29:37,604
imagination. Right? Donald was kinda telling them this as a fun little throw it. But now the nephews are just seeing

222
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:46,659
spies around every corner and behind every rock and they're they're kinda getting freaked out. They they mentioned a guy with a long beard,

223
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:55,488
nephew says that he could have he could hide the plans of a battleship in those whispers and and they see, you know, a bathing beauty and characterize

224
00:29:55,826 --> 00:30:03,004
her as likely being an awfully dangerous spy. And they they keep going on until Donald starts to

225
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:09,994
regret that he said anything at all about spies because now that Nephews user just freaked out, and totally

226
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:23,191
fixated. And so Donald has to kinda separate himself to cool off. So on the third page, he's walking off. We get this great panel that is... It's just a cheesecake panel here. He says,

227
00:30:23,784 --> 00:30:34,769
beautiful scenery and a beautiful scenery. This this is the life for me. And obviously Barks knew what he wanted to draw here. He's he's drawn some beautiful women in period

228
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:35,569
appropriate

229
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:37,769
bathing suits and

230
00:30:38,189 --> 00:30:55,251
very clearly in enjoyed doing it. And and that that stood out as a twelve year old the first time I read this. It's like this this one does seem a little bit different here. Yeah. And and and I and I think the prior panels that you just went over Barks kinda show the Nephews in a bit of out of character.

231
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:15,919
They they got sucked into this in intrigued, which I think is a young boy myself reading this comic, I could relate to their their fears. But I love how Donald just turns the tables. And gets mad, but then it's then he's in heaven right now. Yeah. Warren, it is one of those those the kind of atypical for the comics where the kids are acting

232
00:31:16,258 --> 00:31:38,106
their age and the adult says something and and the kids run with it and then annoy the adult. Yeah. They good point. Yeah, That's true. Sometimes sometimes he really wants the nephews to be in command, but sometimes he needs them to act more like kids. And before before you talk about the next sequence one, I just wanted to really mention the all of the

233
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:39,239
images.

234
00:31:39,699 --> 00:32:23,101
The mysterious people on the riviera here, they're they're really straight out of Hollywood. Like you were saying at the beginning. Right? This definitely sets us up to feel like this is a cinematic thriller. Oh, yeah. It is The framing. Oh, yeah. The framing of the the panels. And as Donald walking off. He's a convinced he's not gonna to get into any trouble, but then we see the first soon sinister spy under the docks and under the here talking about about counter spies and being followed and introduces us to Madame Triple x, but he's got to pass on some secrets and so he stumbles across Donald who then walks up nonchalant lee and asked if he could do a favor for him and I love Dom response. What you feet sore. You

235
00:32:23,534 --> 00:32:31,088
then he looks he looks very worried the spy mentions that he doesn't dare seen near a lady. So we just toss

236
00:32:31,465 --> 00:32:37,146
looks like a lipstick stick tube, and Donald nonchalant walks over. And as he walks away,

237
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:44,154
the spy now is talking about the message that's in that little canister and

238
00:32:44,534 --> 00:32:54,591
begins to think about foreign agents approaching that he hears and then all of a sudden we see agent after counter agent after counter counter spy appear, and then a wonderful

239
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:57,439
last panel on that page shows

240
00:32:57,937 --> 00:33:12,680
a series of six spies pointing guns at each other as they talk about shooting each other. This is kind of the drama now that we're we're starting to see unfold. And then as Donald walks away, we hear this singular bang and can only imagine what that means.

241
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:20,924
He thinks it's just fire going on. I did like the all of the agents kind of showing up and pointing guns at each other.

242
00:33:21,658 --> 00:33:50,224
You know, it it does seem kind of scary intense, but there's operator x and operator double x and and counter counter spy, and I just love the they're like, oh, here's operator X. Oh, I'll just like, was there a sign up sheet? Did they have a Zoom meeting about this? How did they coordinate different names? One looks like he's coming out of the sand like he was better in the. That's that's what gets me. You guys I love this panel

243
00:33:50,804 --> 00:33:53,559
so much. I am I could tell.

244
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:55,699
I could talk about this panel.

245
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:57,679
First off, it is

246
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:58,459
hilarious.

247
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:06,689
Right? I I just... I need to read these in full because it's great he tells he tells the counter spike he says

248
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:15,849
you I have too late t me with the goods. What are you gonna do about it? And the counter spy says, I'm gonna shoot you operator double x

249
00:34:16,243 --> 00:34:24,146
super spy. Warren and do you wanna read the next one? Sure. But not before I shoot you cloak Dagger counters spy.

250
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:29,095
Sarah And I shoot you operator x counter counter spy.

251
00:34:29,874 --> 00:34:35,184
And then and I shoot you f b Nick i counter counter counters

252
00:34:35,522 --> 00:34:36,022
spy.

253
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:46,890
And then we get a man who's, like cut off the panel, but he's clearly keeping the sequence going. They're all, like one foot away from each other, and it's just this amazing

254
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:49,002
lamb pruning of

255
00:34:49,338 --> 00:35:01,379
both the the, like real life spy activity that it must've have seemed like was going on that was peeking into the newspapers and also all of the ridiculous over the top spy and counters by

256
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:03,653
hollywood stuff. So

257
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:27,814
this panel, this panel is is a work of art to me. And it's one of the greatest parts of this story and maybe one of the best things that he's done in the duck comics. And they're all imp dressed on a Sandy Beach. I just love that. They're new guides. Yeah. It's a classic. And and you're right warren, it closes off with one singular bang, which means that they probably all shot each other dead simultaneously.

258
00:35:28,354 --> 00:35:33,574
So this is our first bit of implied depth, you know. Yeah there are several of the big wu

259
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:39,192
coming out of that the side of a panel, but only a singular Barks.

260
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:48,954
Alright. Dare I take us on to the next. So Donald thinks that that singular bang is fire crackers, and he's so innocent like oh, how nice. Fire truckers.

261
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:51,469
And walks up to

262
00:35:52,407 --> 00:36:00,114
triple x, who has already seen him coming because she's looking in her contact compact in the mirror and her compact. Right? Because she's

263
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:04,234
med triple x, super spy. She's on top of everything.

264
00:36:04,574 --> 00:36:10,569
And he says, heidi home, i was ill. Did you lose your lipstick? And she comes in with a french accent.

265
00:36:11,029 --> 00:36:12,449
Oh, so I did.

266
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:15,169
Thank you so much.

267
00:36:15,604 --> 00:36:22,598
She plays the, like, c to him him and he gets literal stars in his eyes and starts to mimic her accent

268
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:27,953
that voice says eyes, z lips, and she smiled at me

269
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,228
love

270
00:36:29,963 --> 00:36:30,663
He opens

271
00:36:31,493 --> 00:36:31,993
lipstick,

272
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:32,990
she

273
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:35,104
decides she needs to find an isolated

274
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:37,297
place to read this and

275
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:40,926
has found a place that's within eye of the boys

276
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:59,777
and decides it's safe. They are suspicious and they see her open up the lipstick and see that it's a dummy and read that there's a message. And then she decides to leave it on the beach because we're encounter spies are closing in. I don't know why she doesn't eat the paper. I mean... Yeah. No time

277
00:37:00,729 --> 00:37:04,269
no time to chew it up and swallow it. So she hides it in the sand.

278
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:08,430
The kids, of course, go up and and un it

279
00:37:08,863 --> 00:37:09,363
and

280
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,117
see that it's just

281
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:19,184
a message in English so they can read it and they say, whoa, that's serious. And they all scream oh donald.

282
00:37:19,721 --> 00:37:34,165
Yeah. That... This is a really nice setup. We get this really good look as at Madame Triple x as someone who knows what she's doing. I love the little sn and sn as she walks past the counter agents that she's out fox.

283
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,800
I did wanna to point out with it

284
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,840
out of all of the women

285
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:46,895
that parks is drawn on the beach, and as you said, markets it's very clear that he took some care to draw them. She's

286
00:37:47,235 --> 00:37:47,735
wearing

287
00:37:48,155 --> 00:38:11,463
a bikini you know, the a more modest type of a bikini, you know, compared to what we would wear today. But she's the only one showing any torso. Yeah. It's definitely pretty revealing, especially like you said compared to the other yeah. Because they all have you're right. They all have one piece. So she she is the ph fatal patel here. So the nephews bring it back to Donald and he immediately

288
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:35,249
recognizes it as the lipstick. And he reads the message, which just says Madame triple x deliver stolen plans of Us qb to operator forex x in Chile be. There's a lot there. Right? It's So we... We're referencing the a bomb right away as the qb Barks. So we've got some atomic paranoia here. He goes on to read operator for x is known into the world as Don El,

289
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:36,285
the bull.

290
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:41,987
The the reader, of course, immediately knows that this is gonna be a Donald do gainer, that he doesn't

291
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:43,519
recognize this.

292
00:38:43,898 --> 00:38:47,315
And so, you know, before Donald was annoyed by their

293
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:59,555
spy fear mon, but now he realizes how serious this is. And he is unwilling to go to the police because he he says that the case is too big. The story is propelled forward here.

294
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:15,536
Because of the the cold war paranoia of. We can't go to the police. This is two important too dangerous and that might seem silly, but we did just see the Atomic bomb dropped a few years prior. So kind of everyone knows the stakes. And so... It's also

295
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:25,310
totally in character for Donald and his super poor boundaries. Right? Everybody's problem is his problem, and his problem is everybody else's problem

296
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:39,266
So this is just an example of him deciding to take on something that isn't his responsibility. Right. Everything is gonna become the Ducktales business. Right. And he says we have to be suspicious of everybody and everything.

297
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:42,862
And he resolves. They've gotta get to the Chile Berg area

298
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:51,929
and hijack the plan and we learned that Chile Bulgaria is a country west of here. It's gonna be kind of an

299
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:57,980
for Spain like you said, sarah. Right. So they get on the train now, which is going to take them directly

300
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,300
to the Chile Be

301
00:40:00,973 --> 00:40:01,993
Area and

302
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:10,868
they they assume by getting on the train that they are either with step or one step ahead of madame damn triple x.

303
00:40:11,486 --> 00:40:18,812
But they did see her come on board the train, but they get a nice comfortable car. They seem to be in control of the situation when

304
00:40:19,445 --> 00:40:21,623
they look out the window then. And...

305
00:40:22,082 --> 00:40:26,697
But they do see all of a sudden a passenger jet Zoom by and

306
00:40:27,036 --> 00:40:35,350
is now convinced that she may have taken the plane and will get there before they do. But just then we see our first counter spy who

307
00:40:35,730 --> 00:41:13,846
jumps out of the seat that Donald was sitting on from underneath, a very men looking figure in a black suit holding a gun pointing it right at the ducks. He he says, and I'll say it, i operator minus x, counter counter counter counter counter counters spy have other plans. Again playing on the whole by being back and forth. And he orders donald that he just says you're gonna jump out the window. Donald immediately says no, not at eighty miles an hour. And as he ready to jump out the the triangles into a tunnel and the the frame turns completely pitch black. And I love this because it sets it up for a series of gag. But he says, well, I I can't jump now. There's a tunnel

308
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:16,893
you see the counter spy curse.

309
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:21,194
But just then one of the fuse is ready to poke him in

310
00:41:21,531 --> 00:41:31,745
the the seat of the pants with a a sharp needle. It says you can jump now. Chu. And this is that poke. And this great panel sequence here where you see the kind of diagonal

311
00:41:32,285 --> 00:41:48,725
drawing with the train on the bridge and the counter spy falling out presumably to update passing here and then Donald says creep spies pop out of every place. What happens next and we see this great shot of Madame Barks Know start jumping from the plane to see the parachute

312
00:41:49,145 --> 00:41:49,645
landing

313
00:41:50,065 --> 00:42:08,665
on top of the train and this wonderful shot of her kind of looking down in there. As she says I jumped from the plane, may I come in, and then, of course, Donald completely surprised, but also just marvel Al her again and sort the nephews A lot of Gladstone take in here mark sarah. Is the

314
00:42:08,965 --> 00:42:11,465
pin in the bum? Is that a common

315
00:42:11,845 --> 00:42:25,543
trope because it felt familiar And I read it and I lash out loud because it's so silly, but also it felt, like oh, yes. This. Like I'd seen it before how how common is that? Yeah Absolutely.

316
00:42:26,162 --> 00:42:48,367
For someone who is like a gag man in the old Disney cartoons, this is something that you would have seen in in a lot. Of those. Definitely Al a common trope. So but you guys I love this train sequence, and I I didn't remember how much of the story really takes place with the train until I revisited this. But it feels so classic, you know, European

317
00:42:48,744 --> 00:43:07,361
set spy movie, of course, a lot of it has to be set on the train self contained in one of these train compartments. The nephews and Donald who helps trip him, and they they murdered this guy. Right? Like He he is not surviving this unless we really lean into the cartoon logic, I guess, he could have landed

318
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:26,325
safely in the body of water down there. I mean he could have been rescued by Hydra and turned into a super soldier. We don't know or that now now it's justified. Right? I'm not I'm not like accusing them of doing something improper here, but but they're definitely kinda need to process that.

319
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:33,671
I don't think the Ducktales knew when they poked him with a pin that the train happened to be on a bridge. They just knew that he left out, but

320
00:43:34,584 --> 00:43:38,001
not. And he's not a sympathetic character But yeah, it's it's vicious.

321
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,115
For sure. I just definitely wanna highlight Al all our instances of of characters

322
00:43:43,628 --> 00:43:44,128
dying

323
00:43:44,744 --> 00:43:45,244
this

324
00:43:45,859 --> 00:44:01,440
Right. You know, you touched on something that that sparked an idea in my brain Warren. He's not a sympathetic character. And and it's made clear that he's not a sympathetic character, not just because he's pointing a gun at Our Ducktales.

325
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,100
But because he's not drawn as attractive.

326
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,020
Right. As the sympathetic characters

327
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,380
are, and it's not just

328
00:44:09,735 --> 00:44:13,315
Oh, well, she's a woman so we're gonna draw her attractive.

329
00:44:13,815 --> 00:44:24,993
It turns out that she... Well, maybe I shouldn't spoil that, no. But you you make a good point though. I mean, if you look at him too, he's got shades of Peter Lori, the the kind of rap kind of looking

330
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:46,336
James C when he was a bad guy then he became a good guy in a lot of those movies. But to me, this chain sequence was right out of thirty nine steps. There's so many shades of all of these great hitchcock trained movies This guy's is just pure bad. I mean Barks took extra measures to say he's gonna fall a long way. I'm guessing

331
00:44:46,689 --> 00:44:50,738
I'm guessing he drew that river down there as as like, prop

332
00:44:51,235 --> 00:44:58,975
against his editors telling him. I can't show him dying. Oh, absolutely. Wait. Well, that's that's classic Disney. Right? Like, nobody can actually

333
00:44:59,395 --> 00:45:05,747
die. They can only fall off of things. No. You you don't show the death you can you can... But this one

334
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:12,851
walks up to the line way more than than most and them. So Madame Triple x comes in

335
00:45:13,723 --> 00:45:18,011
she's holding her purse. She's she's dressed the pink dress now

336
00:45:18,748 --> 00:45:22,616
instead of just her bathing suit. So men and the planes scared me.

337
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,306
Think say wanted just this bag.

338
00:45:26,706 --> 00:45:34,768
She she butters them up. She says, thank you for for having me and making me feel safe Donald offers her drugs. Yeah.

339
00:45:37,178 --> 00:45:41,226
Can't i give you some sleeping pills, M hell you must be very

340
00:45:43,134 --> 00:45:44,591
And she says no.

341
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:52,042
I'm sure I will go to see without any help and then she falls asleep. It looks like a trap. Right, Like,

342
00:45:53,278 --> 00:45:54,035
Ducktales

343
00:45:54,235 --> 00:45:55,851
everybody nudge he

344
00:45:56,268 --> 00:45:56,768
her

345
00:45:57,264 --> 00:46:07,110
now that she is asleep because they want the bag. And as they as Donald reaches for it, cl, a knife comes down in between his fingers and shields yields.

346
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:11,753
So you would like to steer my little bag black bag.

347
00:46:12,351 --> 00:46:16,856
Jump all of you up the window chip. They're back in the same predicament.

348
00:46:17,314 --> 00:46:17,814
And

349
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:20,586
they goodness another tunnel,

350
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:23,042
this spice, she says curse

351
00:46:23,675 --> 00:46:24,775
And it turns out

352
00:46:25,235 --> 00:46:29,055
they do jump. It is safe once they get out of the tunnel

353
00:46:29,395 --> 00:46:29,895
And

354
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:34,086
Mcdonald's demeanor has has clearly changed. Right? Because he like,

355
00:46:34,885 --> 00:46:35,385
volunteers.

356
00:46:35,884 --> 00:46:40,035
Oh, yeah. Not only is it clear for them to jump out, but

357
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,583
they kind of willingly do it. And

358
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:48,099
he says, okay, madam triple x, now, we will jump

359
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:48,920
Al,

360
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,319
and they jump into a stream. I've Gottfredson

361
00:46:53,319 --> 00:47:06,394
restrained myself from talking too much about this sequence, but but again, There's so much going on here. First off, you're you're right. She's like she's clearly laying a trap. Barks does a really nice job. I think of giving her some agency

362
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:09,104
here. And and as as a woman,

363
00:47:10,021 --> 00:47:14,991
she... She's judging that her best way to to test these new people

364
00:47:15,304 --> 00:47:22,476
is to look like she's letting her guard down. It's really clever. Right? She... This is the first time she brings out her s.

365
00:47:22,975 --> 00:47:23,475
And

366
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:38,066
you know, she can give as good as any of those spies. So she's willing to to tell him to jump out the window as she knows she needs to. And I don't think that there's anything unto word about what the ducks do here, but it it definitely

367
00:47:38,442 --> 00:47:40,457
looks deeply uncomfortable.

368
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:43,823
They're they're really eater expressions

369
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,852
and the offer of sleeping pills and then the n

370
00:47:48,364 --> 00:47:59,519
you know, just to be like around this beautiful woman and and waiting for her to go to sleep it in in the context of this story, It's very reasonable and it's very

371
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:01,680
understandable. But the way the camera

372
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:06,574
lingers on her and the overall situation it feels

373
00:48:07,073 --> 00:48:07,573
extremely

374
00:48:07,992 --> 00:48:08,471
unsettling.

375
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:13,886
I I didn't even think of it that way because I was so focused on the mac.

376
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:15,139
U

377
00:48:15,796 --> 00:48:17,133
But you're so

378
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:18,188
right.

379
00:48:18,707 --> 00:48:24,051
I mean, the Ducktales are focused on the Mac. You know, they're they're not thinking about anything else, but, like,

380
00:48:24,784 --> 00:48:30,438
it's as a reader, it's impossible not to think about that. That situation. And and

381
00:48:30,817 --> 00:48:32,875
the comic book's camera

382
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:47,975
has like been so focused on her and how beautiful she is in and look at that second panel you guys when she has just gotten into the train car and she's like, my her hair. It it it looks

383
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:49,655
incredibly su.

384
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:57,120
It is. And she's positioning herself as this ph patel and she's... I loved what you said about her.

385
00:48:57,814 --> 00:49:02,381
Testing the ducks. What I love about it is we we move down toward the

386
00:49:03,158 --> 00:49:09,217
where they they become the guilty culprits of being spies themselves by almost being the counter spy to her

387
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:15,260
by stealing it they're. They're just as guilty as the other spies, maybe not as lethal, but they're guilty.

388
00:49:15,714 --> 00:49:23,530
And then I love Donald because this is classic donald, but we gotta draw a peace treaty. Come on. We gotta do something. And then the icy cold jump

389
00:49:23,909 --> 00:49:31,693
before the Tunnel sequence. The little spikes down from that speech bubble. Yeah. I see cold exactly. It's great.

390
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:41,530
Warren and you're absolutely right. They're they're playing... They're playing in the mud, you know, they they feel like they have to because they're doing this on behalf of their country.

391
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:44,730
So when they land and what is pretty fortunately,

392
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:46,410
you know, a shallow

393
00:49:47,243 --> 00:49:52,692
retention pond or whatever. The nephews are a gas that he didn't try to put up more of a fight. But

394
00:49:53,230 --> 00:50:03,398
we get this nice reveal where he's like, you know, on yourselves. I Donald duck Super spy got what I was after and he pulls out the black bag, which he has

395
00:50:03,895 --> 00:50:05,450
secreted in his clothes.

396
00:50:06,105 --> 00:50:06,605
And

397
00:50:06,945 --> 00:50:12,925
and he takes a look to see if the qb bomb plans are safe. But he's horrified

398
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:14,525
to find only

399
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:27,092
rib bread and Al salami. And and we get this great pan back to Triple x when she she is chuck to herself hoping that the that z joy might lunch.

400
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:32,945
And then we got another great moment of the counters spy appearing

401
00:50:33,299 --> 00:50:34,199
the other

402
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,155
seat is also sea

403
00:50:37,974 --> 00:50:42,524
a a counter spy who says I hope you enjoy lunch with me in

404
00:50:42,863 --> 00:50:46,979
handcuffs and introduces him self as Scotland ex,

405
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:51,289
counter counter counter counter, never mind, counter.

406
00:50:52,743 --> 00:50:57,191
A great little lamp shading of of this ridiculous back and forth.

407
00:50:57,568 --> 00:51:12,866
And so the Ducktales we transitioned back to the docs while, is dealing with him, and and they've noticed that their train is making a bend. So they get ready to board the train again and as they look like they're going to, Madame triple x

408
00:51:13,364 --> 00:51:14,304
does her own

409
00:51:15,162 --> 00:51:20,709
and lands bodily on them She has jumped out of the train. They all

410
00:51:21,685 --> 00:51:22,185
tumble

411
00:51:22,603 --> 00:51:24,740
down the ravi into the water

412
00:51:25,237 --> 00:51:25,737
and

413
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:27,470
She

414
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:31,150
explains that she didn't like the fresh gentleman

415
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,630
that popped from under the other

416
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:35,963
who wanted to put bracelets

417
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:48,879
on her wrists. So we've got this interesting little bit where she's she's clearly referring to, you know, he wants to arrest her, but but she's presenting it like it's a come on. And and we got this little moment of d

418
00:51:49,377 --> 00:51:53,445
now where they're kind of on the same level, They both just out of the train.

419
00:51:54,105 --> 00:52:22,790
So they do get that little almost peace treaty and she offers to have some of that rye bread and Al salami. Yeah. Mark, the the narrative panel introduces sort of this next sequence where... Yeah, I think there's they're a little at peace and I love the transition from her bending over and her hair kinda must and she's dripping wet. And the boys and Donald are clearly happy to see her, but the next panel talks it kind of refers her back to the the spy who still has the hidden plans

420
00:52:23,128 --> 00:52:24,586
perhaps in her shoe.

421
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:28,915
They're curious. And then if you... It's she's w and humming

422
00:52:29,415 --> 00:52:31,835
gladly now becoming sort of the domestic

423
00:52:32,695 --> 00:52:33,195
character

424
00:52:34,135 --> 00:52:35,615
preparing them a meal with that.

425
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:39,809
Salami and Rye. Ducktales don't look so thrilled anymore.

426
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:50,734
They're waiting for an opportunity to get the upper hand once again, but still very very worried about getting those plans to the other spy in Chile Be. So

427
00:52:51,152 --> 00:52:52,730
they are eating the sandwiches,

428
00:52:53,547 --> 00:52:58,293
a little far shot of her clamoring up the hill in her heels, which I think is really interesting.

429
00:52:59,469 --> 00:53:03,380
It was a pleasure to dine with you. I'll be on my way and now boys.

430
00:53:03,953 --> 00:53:06,726
Wait. We'll go with you. We'll be your bodyguard

431
00:53:07,182 --> 00:53:10,274
and she just looks over her shoulder and she goes

432
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,365
boys. That is so the role.

433
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,440
And she starts laughing

434
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:17,479
and as they clam up the hill after her,

435
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:29,989
the Nephew starts getting a little dr. This is where Donald looks back at the sleeping nephews on the bank right near the track, Donald finally realizes that madame Triple X has Al laced their sandwiches

436
00:53:30,406 --> 00:53:30,906
with

437
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,200
what does he say?

438
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,960
Sleeping pi

439
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,440
and he

440
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,640
kong's out

441
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:37,640
dangerously

442
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:42,442
with it the long Ducktales neck over the rail on the train, and that's where

443
00:53:42,818 --> 00:53:55,972
we leave it off there, Sarah. What do you think? Yeah. I just wondering if the sleeping pills that she used were the Ducktales own. I thought about that if if she was able to find them... Okay. I have a feeling she had her own collection. Yeah. She's also

444
00:53:56,645 --> 00:53:57,385
she's also

445
00:53:57,845 --> 00:54:07,834
so skilled. I think she could have gotten theirs and not how to dig into her own stash. Sure knows how to use that s though. She can use it as a weapon and as a kitchen.

446
00:54:08,253 --> 00:54:11,525
I like that. Right. So she continues to

447
00:54:12,145 --> 00:54:17,345
climb the hill. She says those widely streams won't to be following me soon.

448
00:54:17,959 --> 00:54:28,855
I can afford to snatch a little rest myself in the cool tall grass. She's gonna take a nap of proper nap while they're drugged out on the train tracks.

449
00:54:29,515 --> 00:54:42,741
Meanwhile, the cannonball ball express roar near and nearer And inside the the train, the drivers, the engineers are are asked them. What time is it Pierre? Six o'clock, gaston dawn?

450
00:54:43,353 --> 00:54:51,240
Six o'clock, sexy Barks stops the train. Why what floor? At six o'clock, we trade men go on strike have you forgot

451
00:54:52,098 --> 00:54:53,278
And they train

452
00:54:53,657 --> 00:55:31,926
just stops in the middle of wherever they are inches away from Mcdonald's Neck. I feel like that was a little bit of the kind of look that Gladstone Gander would have. And I was glad that to see that Donald had some of it. But he doesn't even know it. Right? That's the way that he's allowed to have that kind look. And this sequence here was to me the the little slaps stick sequence Al little you've seen this in Harold Lloyd movies you've seen this in a lot of these silent films with the train that's... Now for for this reason, they go on strike, which is pure comedy, perfect timing And and the characters, I will say I don't know about both of you, but the

453
00:55:32,465 --> 00:55:33,444
Pierre and gaston

454
00:55:33,943 --> 00:55:42,161
look a little bit more cartoon ish. They don't have that real stick human features. They've got extended noses. Whether they're they're getting French car.

455
00:55:42,698 --> 00:55:46,920
Right? Yes. They are Al that. Yeah. They're supposed to look like the french

456
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:47,818
branches.

457
00:55:48,217 --> 00:55:49,395
They have like, stereotypical

458
00:55:49,853 --> 00:55:53,585
French names again. I really like how

459
00:55:54,003 --> 00:56:03,776
suspense this bit feels. Right? Like, he's he's Al asleep on the tracks. It looks very dramatic. And then the fact that he gets saved by this far

460
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:28,345
And this is Barks poking fun at like this common... What's it called? You know, this this is one of those stereotypes about the French. And many Europeans, but like, this is well known that French rail or rail rail workers are always going on strike. And this is a little bit of Barks, I think poking fun of a little bit of fun organized labor. I don't think he's the biggest fan of

461
00:56:28,922 --> 00:56:29,422
lamborghini

462
00:56:29,815 --> 00:56:37,535
Right. Right. Alright. So the Ducktales eventually wake and and they encounter this this deserted train here.

463
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:46,752
And you know, they don't really even register how close donald came. But they're they're kind of despair that the train is completely deserted

464
00:56:47,224 --> 00:56:51,951
they're annoyed because, you know, this could have been a great way to get to Chile Berg area.

465
00:56:52,607 --> 00:57:04,205
And and they resolve it kind of dawn on them that, hey. Maybe we don't need to be super honest because we are doing... We're we're doing what we're doing in the interest of saving country.

466
00:57:04,585 --> 00:57:05,325
So they

467
00:57:05,785 --> 00:57:19,030
decide to take the train and Donald gradually figures out how to operate it, and we get this nice little shot of the train gearing up as it passes the sleeping mud triple x.

468
00:57:20,005 --> 00:57:20,505
She

469
00:57:20,965 --> 00:57:27,876
sees that as a good opportunity to herself to get to chile area and and she jumps the aboard. And we get this

470
00:57:28,252 --> 00:57:30,545
nice little short segment where

471
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,939
again, lamp

472
00:57:32,794 --> 00:57:33,511
organized labor.

473
00:57:34,205 --> 00:57:36,025
That we've got this runaway

474
00:57:36,325 --> 00:57:37,345
locomotive, but

475
00:57:37,845 --> 00:57:50,325
a switch man refuses to just do the simple action of throwing the switch to derail it. Telling the mayor that a switch are on strike. I love the whole idea of Madam Triple x

476
00:57:50,744 --> 00:57:53,358
lounging in the grass and the the opportunity

477
00:57:53,855 --> 00:57:54,355
to

478
00:57:54,932 --> 00:57:55,731
jump on a train,

479
00:57:56,688 --> 00:58:02,374
certainly not knowing who's piloting the train or who's the engineer? I just I just love her so much.

480
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:06,110
She's like, okay. I'm gonna take a nap. Because

481
00:58:06,584 --> 00:58:07,882
resting is important.

482
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:16,880
Yeah. Yeah. And and then she sees an opportunity and she takes it. And she gets back on the train. And then there's another instance of

483
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,780
donald and the boys getting Gladstone

484
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:37,134
type look with the train switcher, also being on strike. So they just get to pass on through and do whatever they want. Yeah. And it feels like that kinda happens stance that happens in these movies. Right? I thought of that too where she pair right onto their train car. Right? Oh, yeah. No.

485
00:58:37,633 --> 00:58:44,578
Really kind of fore foreshadowing and a lot of the great spy movies of after this. So if we pick it up with the train

486
00:58:44,957 --> 00:58:46,513
barely into Chile Be,

487
00:58:47,032 --> 00:58:50,505
hours ahead of of of Donald and the Nephews fond Hopes.

488
00:58:51,238 --> 00:59:09,546
I find this kind of an interesting sequence because then the boys and Donald jump jump off what they think is an abandoned train and of course, Madame Triple x is surprised in this next panel as she either awakens or just looks out the window and and notices that they're barrel through Chile Be.

489
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:10,720
She

490
00:59:11,139 --> 00:59:16,753
holds the emergency stop cord on in her car and we see this

491
00:59:17,172 --> 00:59:19,285
incredible sequence of this train

492
00:59:19,824 --> 00:59:20,803
breaking down

493
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,958
in the track buck

494
00:59:23,456 --> 00:59:25,313
to a a fierce stop.

495
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:29,319
She's not injured, but boy that next panel shows her determined

496
00:59:29,936 --> 00:59:40,342
that full engineer. I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind. And then she realizes and almost faint when she realizes that There isn't an engineer in the camp. Did you guys notice

497
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:50,524
her accents slip out here? I did. I noticed there's no z There's no... And it's almost like she breaks into Georgia Corn a little bit. Yeah.

498
00:59:50,941 --> 01:00:06,523
What do you think? You think that was intentional? Did Barks let that happen or did Huey, make a did slip. Yeah. I mean, she's she doesn't need to, like, keep up the facade, but but I I remember as a reader the first time I read this I didn't notice. Right? He has the

499
01:00:07,259 --> 01:00:07,759
luxury

500
01:00:08,096 --> 01:00:15,455
when he's writing the dialogue. He can write it Wait. I didn't realize it until I went back. And read it again and oh, you know, we...

501
01:00:15,815 --> 01:00:16,635
I was just

502
01:00:17,175 --> 01:00:18,435
inserting her accent

503
01:00:19,055 --> 01:00:22,115
here, but but she's not. So I thought that

504
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:46,911
It's a very good play by Barks knowing that she's alone, and there's nobody around her so why she have to put on a show. Good. Call. But the reader is not... They're not gonna notice it unless they're being really a astute. It's interesting to hear that when she lets her guard down, she she doesn't have to keep up that facade. It's the only time we see her kind of at a loss and, like, looking very emotional.

505
01:00:47,405 --> 01:00:52,505
Yeah. I didn't I... you know, me and and Barks accents. I hope had kind of

506
01:00:52,925 --> 01:00:57,834
blocked it out. And so when it wasn't there, I just hadn't been paying attention.

507
01:00:58,330 --> 01:00:59,308
Oh, my gosh.

508
01:00:59,685 --> 01:01:00,004
That's...

509
01:01:00,601 --> 01:01:01,101
Genius.

510
01:01:01,877 --> 01:01:02,735
Okay. So

511
01:01:03,072 --> 01:01:03,572
Donald,

512
01:01:03,965 --> 01:01:07,465
So they're clearly in Chile Bulgaria, which is,

513
01:01:08,565 --> 01:01:13,798
you know, spain. And during that time, it was under the rule of general Franco.

514
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:17,554
An enemy

515
01:01:17,893 --> 01:01:19,791
to the allied powers,

516
01:01:21,064 --> 01:01:22,123
at that point.

517
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:23,042
And

518
01:01:23,861 --> 01:01:24,720
they are

519
01:01:25,059 --> 01:01:26,199
trying to locate

520
01:01:26,977 --> 01:01:28,516
operator for x

521
01:01:29,588 --> 01:01:31,005
And then here's a

522
01:01:31,502 --> 01:01:33,597
here's another accent so bad

523
01:01:34,094 --> 01:01:38,662
that I feel offended on behalf of all of the brown people

524
01:01:39,014 --> 01:01:42,304
that he's used it on previously, but this is a European.

525
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:47,220
Yeah. So I have mixed feelings about it, and I'm not going to imitate it

526
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:52,247
Da La crackle is in his dressing room Al deb boo

527
01:01:53,423 --> 01:01:53,822
obviously,

528
01:01:54,675 --> 01:01:59,964
bull fighting has is is very, very steep in the culture of

529
01:02:00,422 --> 01:02:00,922
of

530
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,479
Spain and Portugal

531
01:02:02,937 --> 01:02:03,437
literally

532
01:02:04,149 --> 01:02:07,319
every town of above a certain size

533
01:02:07,815 --> 01:02:08,315
anywhere

534
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:09,869
on that peninsula

535
01:02:10,365 --> 01:02:11,441
has its own bull.

536
01:02:12,293 --> 01:02:22,360
And Americans, of course are familiar with it from hemingway weight back you know, fifteen, twenty years before. And so they go to find Donald El,

537
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,020
and

538
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,360
and they realize he looks just like uncle Donald.

539
01:02:28,135 --> 01:02:29,215
Except with black hair.

540
01:02:29,895 --> 01:02:32,375
Donald gets a super wonderful idea,

541
01:02:32,895 --> 01:02:34,295
we can guess what that is.

542
01:02:34,855 --> 01:02:37,155
And one of the boys recognizes

543
01:02:37,869 --> 01:02:39,166
Med triple x

544
01:02:39,542 --> 01:02:44,522
coming up the way and they have to work fast to execute Donald idea.

545
01:02:45,174 --> 01:02:56,852
Yeah. Barks version of Spain kinda looks like Mexico to me. I don't know If i'm off base there, but it looks like Adobe pueblo. The traditional dress on the woman in the window

546
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,386
indicated to me that the the veil,

547
01:02:59,745 --> 01:03:00,245
especially

548
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:04,732
kind of like, oh, yes. This is Spain. It it is kind of non.

549
01:03:05,111 --> 01:03:05,271
Right?

550
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:09,786
Okay. He's not drawing it as lovingly as he does the French riviera.

551
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:10,880
Right.

552
01:03:11,239 --> 01:03:11,739
So

553
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:19,343
so the docs do exactly what we think they're gonna do. Right? The the plan is very obvious. They get the jump on Don

554
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,858
Cla, Donald,

555
01:03:21,514 --> 01:03:22,412
very amusing

556
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:34,251
refers and to himself Al Don El Ducktales to you bud and they have to get him out of the way to keep him quiet. And and they while Donald is getting dressed,

557
01:03:34,905 --> 01:03:35,405
and

558
01:03:35,784 --> 01:03:37,622
coloring his quote, hair,

559
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:39,800
black. The nephews

560
01:03:40,139 --> 01:03:43,556
are figuring out that they can put him in the shower

561
01:03:43,950 --> 01:04:28,671
and run this cold water hose that's labeled Ag f. And this this is kind of this very cartoon ish analog for, like don't don't move or you'll get it. It's it's instead of the nephew holding him at bay with a gun, they're holding him at Bay with freezing cold water. It's it's kinda ridiculous. It's kinda funny and it's kind of uncomfortable all at the same time to me. And and Donald Greet my triple x just in time, and he really lays into it after he kinda sykes himself up. He does he's now into his disguise and he's playing this character. He thinks to the Hilton and what he what he should be acting like Don convinced he's playing part here. But them Triple x

562
01:04:29,049 --> 01:04:35,943
comes into the room. Notice his accent kind of goes away there. And of course, now we see a lot of the

563
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,262
cloak dagger here. We see a lot of the back and forth of the the counter spy activity with

564
01:04:41,601 --> 01:04:48,866
Madame triple x basically just a moment Eager beaver. You look too much like a I met on the train. So she's seen through this.

565
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,055
Prove that you are don El.

566
01:04:52,553 --> 01:05:10,573
And this is a funny gag. He sees these this great portrait of himself or the the ronaldo on the wall. Goes Well, there, there's a picture of me. Yeah. I got to see better credentials than that. She says as she spins I could see her spitting this s letter with her hand. It's a classic panel. Just then you see the

567
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:11,410
the

568
01:05:11,827 --> 01:05:16,033
administrators of the bull fight, they kinda come in and so they're ready for you, then although

569
01:05:16,743 --> 01:05:27,148
the crowd is waiting for you. And of course, Madonna triple x says that's it. Where we can see you must fight the and the donald great little gag not quite looking at the camera, but he's looking away

570
01:05:27,487 --> 01:05:27,987
in

571
01:05:28,366 --> 01:05:34,435
disbelief that he's got prove it. He's got Al little lump at his throat. You can tell he's swallowing hard on that one. He was so confident

572
01:05:35,335 --> 01:05:35,835
until

573
01:05:36,215 --> 01:05:43,490
she told him that he had to find the bold to prove who he was. I was really proud of him because you know how sometimes he doesn't have confidence.

574
01:05:44,026 --> 01:05:48,590
Yeah. That's true. This is a great page. I I love this page. Right? This is...

575
01:05:49,006 --> 01:05:50,303
The sequence almost

576
01:05:50,694 --> 01:05:53,825
too short for me. Right? Because this is the dangerous

577
01:05:54,202 --> 01:05:58,466
disguise of the title. Right. You know, he's instantly in this situation.

578
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,540
She's got some great hoses

579
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:06,020
in this page. Like, you you mentioned it warren where she's

580
01:06:06,335 --> 01:06:10,587
spinning the s at and then that very, like, su tree

581
01:06:11,005 --> 01:06:13,380
look as she leaves the room. He

582
01:06:13,918 --> 01:06:26,174
he had fun drawing music. Yeah. Barks isn't afraid of the female form and he wants to accent it anytime he can. And again, we think we said it before, he's taking really good care in his drawing here.

583
01:06:26,673 --> 01:06:29,850
Almost a a a hard contrast to the

584
01:06:30,229 --> 01:06:46,335
the animated human like features of the others in the room the men. Yeah. They look... They look goofy. I think supposed to remind us of Laurel and hardy. Well, maybe here's what I thought and see if see if the readers the listeners Al may agree with this. There's a wonderful

585
01:06:47,035 --> 01:06:47,535
short

586
01:06:48,195 --> 01:06:48,695
animated

587
01:06:49,075 --> 01:06:53,750
silly symphony called Ferdinand and the bull. If you remember that, and it was

588
01:06:54,090 --> 01:07:00,997
done in the mid forties. It's known that the one of the Mat in that storyline

589
01:07:01,573 --> 01:07:02,471
was purposely

590
01:07:03,564 --> 01:07:04,064
i

591
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:10,190
Walt Disney himself. And if you look at this one here, who's coming in, there's a Disney

592
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:35,478
kind of look with the mustache and the shape of the face. And I and I couldn't help, but saying, was Barks kind of borrowing from Ferdinand the bowl and that little side gag of one of them, the mat being walt Disney. I thought that was possible. I be right. That's fun. But there definitely is a laurel and Huey, to now that you've mentioned it especially I was looking on the next page too that Sarah. Yes. Yes.

593
01:07:36,215 --> 01:07:47,137
So Donald is thinking I knew it. I knew it. Something awful would have to turn up and spoil my good luck. So he is recognizing that he's having good luck, but of course, he's focusing

594
01:07:47,714 --> 01:07:50,742
on the bad luck. And he tries to negotiate

595
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,296
asking for an older sick

596
01:07:53,993 --> 01:07:57,260
and the men who are organizing the bull fight her

597
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:04,785
Nun but the wildest fiercest bull's fight in the ring at Chile bulgaria, is a matter of Civic pride

598
01:08:05,124 --> 01:08:07,100
which bull fighting is

599
01:08:07,478 --> 01:08:10,292
the utter... like, the ultimate test of masculinity.

600
01:08:10,989 --> 01:08:12,127
Right. As

601
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,420
the other Mat saying this. He smack

602
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,580
the third mat in the face by accident.

603
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,941
So, you know, very very physical comedy

604
01:08:22,295 --> 01:08:33,320
another kind of call Barks to or another reference to Laurel and Hardy. And and and back in Don Al Cla dressing room. He's doing the

605
01:08:34,055 --> 01:08:34,555
Your

606
01:08:35,173 --> 01:08:39,001
will be showed up for his... The for the fake he is.

607
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:40,294
The kids.

608
01:08:40,893 --> 01:08:47,260
Shut have you dirty spell. You make me still dogg on med and they squirt with the water. Yeah...

609
01:08:47,939 --> 01:08:51,095
Daring to open his mouth. They've turned into ruthless cap.

610
01:08:52,494 --> 01:08:55,890
Poor Al with the cold water. I don't know how Huey, said duck.

611
01:08:56,546 --> 01:08:58,484
Cold waters. Easy. Okay.

612
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:07,169
And then there's a a wide shot of the bull ring. The crowd is cheering for Donald, but it's their cheering for

613
01:09:07,828 --> 01:09:08,608
and that

614
01:09:09,386 --> 01:09:13,481
tease the bellow beast into a towering rage

615
01:09:13,835 --> 01:09:14,774
then outs

616
01:09:15,154 --> 01:09:15,853
the mat,

617
01:09:16,312 --> 01:09:22,007
calm courageous is cock, but it's donald literally sticking his toe in the arena and.

618
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:34,460
Those last three panels on that page are pretty awesome. It it reminds me when I talked about vacation time and there's a great just short three panels where

619
01:09:34,877 --> 01:09:53,392
Barks does this amazing summing up of modern firefight. And in this, you know, it's it's only a couple of panels, but you get a great idea of what bull fighting is all about and and those narrator boxes. He refers to it as the art of getting killed. And has been Al into a rip roaring show.

620
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,347
And I... You know, it's a very controversial

621
01:09:57,687 --> 01:10:02,101
topic, obvious sleeve, but bull fighting is is is it's pretty gross.

622
01:10:03,381 --> 01:10:04,481
But that's a funny

623
01:10:04,941 --> 01:10:07,581
contrast between the com courageous just cocky.

624
01:10:08,196 --> 01:10:12,496
Narration and Donald t watching now. Alright. Alright. So

625
01:10:12,956 --> 01:10:14,416
so the bull fight

626
01:10:14,796 --> 01:10:20,664
is I think it's exactly what you would spec. Right? It takes up two pages.

627
01:10:21,281 --> 01:10:38,356
It is the kind of slaps stick that we we know and we love we've seen this in Loo tunes cartoons. We see an enraged bowl charging. We see Donald barely avoiding. And we see him basically do a good job of fighting the bowl by complete accident.

628
01:10:39,093 --> 01:10:44,143
Right. The whole time my triple x is is watching. And and he basically

629
01:10:44,776 --> 01:10:48,516
it's great, but there's only so much that I can describe it here.

630
01:10:49,056 --> 01:10:55,484
There's a lot of great near misses. He essentially blu and p falls his way into the bowl crashing

631
01:10:55,821 --> 01:10:57,216
through the outer wall,

632
01:10:57,655 --> 01:11:03,433
breaking the fire hydrant flooding the entire arena and and the crowd just

633
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:10,419
loves it. It's been a great show. He's carrying... He's h out on their shoulders as they

634
01:11:10,957 --> 01:11:15,341
parade through the flooded arena. And and it's it's gone as

635
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:21,296
well as it possibly could. And this is one of those cases where if listener if you haven't

636
01:11:21,795 --> 01:11:30,278
read this in a while. You you just gotta see it. I think the panel that you're ending on here with them just just ex. They're just celebrating

637
01:11:31,551 --> 01:11:33,891
Donald in the guise of Don aldo

638
01:11:34,271 --> 01:11:39,711
is absolutely a little surprised he's sitting on their shoulders as they're h them up as a hero.

639
01:11:40,245 --> 01:11:49,491
I love that. And we we see now that he's back in the dressing room. Madame triple x, she's back Al her back against the door and now he is absolutely

640
01:11:50,551 --> 01:11:55,311
convinced who he is. He's done Al and he's going to continue his his char aid.

641
01:11:56,286 --> 01:12:00,706
And ask for those plans. And now we see the real although just

642
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:11,276
cow in fear as those fierce cap as Ci said are are ready to point that hose and give him another spray, but, unfortunately, the water pressure gave out

643
01:12:11,656 --> 01:12:12,156
and

644
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:13,196
then although

645
01:12:13,736 --> 01:12:15,436
immediately lunges out

646
01:12:15,776 --> 01:12:16,996
knocking over the nephews

647
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:26,931
comes into the room Now we see Donald and then aldo together with Madame Triple x and the Nephew great panel there. So he's now kinda wondering who's who and

648
01:12:27,406 --> 01:12:34,206
Alright. Although, you shall have zip plans and z y metal Al watch and sq.

649
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:35,761
And this is where

650
01:12:36,381 --> 01:12:37,841
she does a little bit of

651
01:12:38,181 --> 01:12:39,001
great espionage

652
01:12:39,381 --> 01:12:43,296
work here and that is she peels back her nail where she reveals

653
01:12:43,996 --> 01:12:47,856
I guess a microchip of some kind, they called it a micro photo

654
01:12:48,516 --> 01:12:50,196
of Zip lands marvelous.

655
01:12:50,691 --> 01:13:00,795
Our dictator. This is he's now he's he's got the plans in the dictator. The the Mighty B of Iron Huey, will hang a medal of x around

656
01:13:01,611 --> 01:13:12,694
your neck, Madam, triple x. I hope it choke you your ugly old hague. That's donald now. Screaming from the corner. And that's a great shot of her kind of, you know, away

657
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:21,030
the insult. So as they then although is peer at this microchip chip this micro photo. So these are the plans and Barks

658
01:13:21,948 --> 01:13:23,487
decipher them on twenty

659
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,935
It looks like mess of sulfur,

660
01:13:26,273 --> 01:13:27,788
thirty protons, Gladstone,

661
01:13:28,147 --> 01:13:28,647
octane.

662
01:13:29,702 --> 01:13:36,896
Hey. Something's wrong here. He said the bomb is nothing but a fire cracker. For smoking term termites out of wooden Indians.

663
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:39,648
It's a ru from Met Triple x,

664
01:13:40,445 --> 01:13:40,945
who

665
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:48,540
now takes out her cameron takes a shot of him Don aldo and says I'll say something's wrong here, mister

666
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,693
Mystery Spy, Alias Don, El.

667
01:13:52,205 --> 01:13:59,181
And the boys are now completely beef. The question marks are are shaking their heads they like, what is going on And then

668
01:13:59,898 --> 01:14:05,891
Says you you're not one of B Spies y, and this is where the reveal. I love this reveal.

669
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:12,265
I miss Georgia Ka of the secret secret service and Don Nephew just ecstatic

670
01:14:12,602 --> 01:14:16,609
Right. They realized that that she's one of theirs. And she's American

671
01:14:17,201 --> 01:14:21,616
And now a side view, please as she's taking apparently mug shots

672
01:14:22,075 --> 01:14:23,434
of of Don novo.

673
01:14:24,273 --> 01:14:27,386
I'm on assignment to photograph the key men in B

674
01:14:27,726 --> 01:14:28,506
spy system.

675
01:14:28,806 --> 01:14:29,306
And

676
01:14:29,806 --> 01:14:34,666
now she kind of throws donald the nephews down a little bit because of the be

677
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:44,306
spy hunters over there got on my trail. I almost did succeed in getting you. And here's that troublesome panel that we've been talking a little bit about in some of this. And this is

678
01:14:44,806 --> 01:14:48,906
but you did, and that means that B will send me to the salt mines

679
01:14:49,326 --> 01:15:06,552
and he holler goodbye cruel world and just leaps out of the glass window. I'm not so sure it it's a suicidal tendency, but I'm not so sure that that's what happened, but that's up to the reader. Right? Mean, it's pretty pretty unmistakable. Right? That's the that's the cliche.

680
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:20,654
It is. I guess there's is the plausible den ability you don't see it. But but that... That's how this reads to me. It's it's very striking and... It's consistent with the rest of the story and of the

681
01:15:21,205 --> 01:15:52,621
the brutality of the spy world if you wanna call it that, it's an outcome of donald Ba gang like you said before, who sits Mit. A brave move by Barks, I think. Yeah. I mean, it's definitely memorable. I like this little visual where, you know, they're the ducks are blanc at their little up braid when she's chi them for having almost ruined it, and he draws a little narration box that says very small. They're that's right Very nice And nice and little psych gag. He doesn't do a lot of them in the story, but that's a nice one.

682
01:15:53,061 --> 01:15:54,241
This is a satisfying

683
01:15:54,741 --> 01:16:12,804
reveal. I think. Right? Because he's he's built this up with all this counter counter counter, never mind counter spy and and for her to be the ultimate counter spy. Is a great way I think. It's a good payoff. Satisfying payoff for sure. Barks to the topic of the brutality,

684
01:16:13,595 --> 01:16:16,095
even though it says... And I know

685
01:16:16,555 --> 01:16:25,224
that it's a false finger now, and it's a drawing. Right? Like, it's a drawing and she specifically says it's a false swing nail. The brutality of

686
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:34,895
peeling up that false nail. He's messing with us. He is he making us have some body horror, like, visceral

687
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:36,696
horror feelings

688
01:16:37,475 --> 01:16:37,910
about

689
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:45,361
that finger now. Like, that is intentional and very skilled. Yeah. It looks did either. If you get grossed out by that.

690
01:16:46,135 --> 01:17:09,606
I definitely did as a kid. You know, I had to... I had to kinda look at it and be like, okay. This is this is clearly a a very false snail, but but I I agree. It I i did find that a little disturbing. Yeah. You can feel it you I I agree sarah. You can feel it. She does go out of her way to say that it's my fa finger nail, but that doesn't take away the the pain of the situation

691
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,618
And then her knife, she's...

692
01:17:12,355 --> 01:17:17,305
It's it's kinda due in its own thing. You know, she's holding it at the Ducktales,

693
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:18,044
and then

694
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:19,042
she's

695
01:17:19,476 --> 01:17:23,228
And then, you know, I hope it choke you you ugly had.

696
01:17:23,827 --> 01:17:32,911
You know, before she Al them, she's holding it not by the, like, handled but by the tip of the blade. Like, she's clearly, like,

697
01:17:33,711 --> 01:17:38,866
laying with it and and messing with it. She it gets to ended up stabbed in the dresser,

698
01:17:39,646 --> 01:17:40,906
and then she's

699
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:49,596
holding it in her, you know, between her teeth and her mouth at one point, she's comfortable with it. Yeah. Yeah. And she's very comfortable.

700
01:17:50,135 --> 01:17:52,926
Like, she's just intentionally throwing that

701
01:17:53,546 --> 01:17:54,046
authority

702
01:17:54,466 --> 01:17:56,845
around that menace in their faces.

703
01:17:57,146 --> 01:18:06,914
I I just... I like how she's totally in charge. She's just commanding this situation. Oh, yeah. And then, you know, I mentioned it, but this quick little reference to B.

704
01:18:07,953 --> 01:18:09,851
This is meant to be

705
01:18:10,526 --> 01:18:20,549
stalin and Soviet union pretty clearly. Right? The reference to the salt mine. He's not even a Chile Bulgarian. He He's from Iron He. Is that what he's called?

706
01:18:20,926 --> 01:18:21,802
He's Al iron Huey,.

707
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,791
Yes. So behind the iron Curtain,

708
01:18:25,405 --> 01:18:32,847
Yeah. Yeah. Here's a little outdated reference. Right? It's a fire for smoking termites out of wooden Indians. I guess that's those

709
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:38,940
old Cigar store indians that you almost never see around. Right. So after all those

710
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:44,315
shocking demise, Sarah, what how how does it close out? And so

711
01:18:44,975 --> 01:18:46,715
you see the sign post...

712
01:18:47,015 --> 01:18:50,755
You see the sign post that they had in the first few panels

713
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:55,007
that indicates that they're back in the riviera and

714
01:18:56,105 --> 01:18:57,564
out in the background,

715
01:18:58,262 --> 01:19:04,656
there's a figure in black taking pictures and the boys are noticing him. And

716
01:19:05,635 --> 01:19:12,990
we don't dare tell on Donald. He'd chew our tails off. And you can see he's... Donald Duck is over there. He's still

717
01:19:13,731 --> 01:19:15,151
reeling and and

718
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:16,430
remorse

719
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:17,870
and embarrassed.

720
01:19:18,864 --> 01:19:22,414
Just leaning slumped against rock on the beach in the riviera.

721
01:19:22,972 --> 01:19:30,909
I like your description. He has he's reeling. Right? He's mh he is shook. And he's not having a good time don't. I wonder if

722
01:19:31,846 --> 01:19:32,825
George Ka

723
01:19:33,163 --> 01:19:37,949
paid for him to go to the riviera to get him out of her hair the way uncle sc did.

724
01:19:39,006 --> 01:19:43,377
That would not surprise me. This is a this a nice closing. I think

725
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:46,310
it's need how the story has come full circle.

726
01:19:46,690 --> 01:20:04,384
It's neat how the docs are back to this situation and just all totally should end. That wow, you guys... We we had some really great stuff to say about this one. I I like how this worked out. You guys actually help me appreciate this one a little bit more because it's a very tight

727
01:20:04,761 --> 01:20:07,592
story, and it has some some really neat twists.

728
01:20:08,086 --> 01:20:09,225
Any thoughts

729
01:20:09,966 --> 01:20:13,185
overall, May maybe we can start with you, sarah since you

730
01:20:13,486 --> 01:20:18,156
since you enjoy this one so much relative to the others. Since I'm wiggling my fingers.

731
01:20:18,572 --> 01:20:20,923
Yeah. In front of my face and excitement.

732
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,180
I

733
01:20:22,637 --> 01:20:23,137
freaking

734
01:20:23,753 --> 01:20:24,253
love

735
01:20:24,565 --> 01:20:25,065
Madame

736
01:20:25,443 --> 01:20:26,222
Triple x.

737
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:29,296
She is Georgia hard is

738
01:20:29,715 --> 01:20:30,215
exactly

739
01:20:30,553 --> 01:20:33,826
the kind of spy I wanna be. Right?

740
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,060
Like if women

741
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,341
have to be relegated

742
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:39,660
to

743
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:40,540
these

744
01:20:41,281 --> 01:20:45,075
objects that men look at and don't take seriously,

745
01:20:45,856 --> 01:20:49,356
I would leverage that to my benefit

746
01:20:49,696 --> 01:20:52,289
or, you know, my country's benefit

747
01:20:52,669 --> 01:20:53,169
and

748
01:20:54,067 --> 01:20:59,682
let people underestimate me, and then I I would I would mess him up with my

749
01:21:00,754 --> 01:21:03,968
my little s that I have absolute control over

750
01:21:04,425 --> 01:21:07,577
and parachute out of planes to get onto trains.

751
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:16,041
And take naps because resting is important. I just I just love her so much. She's my hero

752
01:21:16,395 --> 01:21:17,174
You know what

753
01:21:18,188 --> 01:21:23,607
Sarah, I have to just jump on that and say you're absolutely right. She is in control of this story.

754
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:34,663
She is a character that Barks not only had fun writing her dialogue, but trying her and and and letting the viewer as well as the ducks get confused

755
01:21:35,001 --> 01:21:36,557
by her her mission.

756
01:21:37,156 --> 01:21:39,252
You know, it was she was devious.

757
01:21:39,909 --> 01:21:41,048
She made them sandwiches

758
01:21:41,759 --> 01:21:45,011
she uncovered the spy ring. I mean, she did everything.

759
01:21:45,747 --> 01:21:47,563
She even put them down at the end.

760
01:21:48,339 --> 01:21:53,045
She she really was a little bit of everything there. Yeah. There are so many,

761
01:21:53,425 --> 01:21:57,325
like, especially with his handling of of the woman characters.

762
01:21:57,785 --> 01:21:59,380
There's always just like an

763
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:05,220
that even if they're portrait portrayed in a positive light, I'm like, oh,

764
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,515
And this one, it's such it's so first

765
01:22:09,815 --> 01:22:23,276
because she makes them sandwiches, what's what's the stereotype? I don't know if it was the serial back then. But, like, right women are, you know, go the kitchen make me a sandwich. Right? So she makes them a sandwich. She she gets back into this

766
01:22:23,614 --> 01:22:31,746
traditional woman's role. And in doing so, she takes back control of the situation. Yeah. I there's

767
01:22:32,123 --> 01:22:34,577
so many times where she just leveraged

768
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:39,230
the the the box she got put in as a woman and just

769
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:45,632
mess people up, and I love it. Yeah. I I appreciate that. That's great. She's she's awesome.

770
01:22:46,088 --> 01:22:48,199
I found her totally commanding.

771
01:22:48,837 --> 01:22:57,541
Right? Like, I read in the Thomas Andre book too warren. And he he referenced something. He referenced somewhere that, like, she wasn't

772
01:22:58,094 --> 01:22:59,953
that she never really...

773
01:23:00,371 --> 01:23:18,891
I don't remember what he said, but that that she didn't really stack up as a character. And I I strongly disagree. I think she's utterly commanding and very memorable. And and, yeah, some of it is that she looks like a pin up model of course. But but he's working in that spy

774
01:23:19,349 --> 01:23:23,771
arena where your your kind of, quote, allowed to have a fe

775
01:23:24,585 --> 01:23:38,448
character. So... Yeah, The this works really well as what it's trying to do as, you know, being a great spy adventure, but also sending them up with all this over the top. Counter counter counter spy. How about you?

776
01:23:38,886 --> 01:23:48,265
How this one land for you? Well, you know, I again, I'm so appreciative to read these stories after so many years and get a new take on it especially with our commentary and our thoughts.

777
01:23:48,605 --> 01:23:53,434
And when when they apply it to modern modern society and and the cultures that we've seen

778
01:23:53,772 --> 01:23:55,031
I am gonna say,

779
01:23:55,609 --> 01:23:57,546
I think it's a very good story.

780
01:23:58,084 --> 01:24:03,206
I think for me, what's memorable about it is certainly the human characters and how Barks

781
01:24:04,004 --> 01:24:05,381
kinda Al his editors

782
01:24:06,197 --> 01:24:07,056
in his own

783
01:24:07,569 --> 01:24:10,326
fight for freedom of expression, I would say.

784
01:24:11,086 --> 01:24:12,545
So I gave him a lot of credit.

785
01:24:13,164 --> 01:24:16,141
I I love the blending of humor and

786
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:16,840
intrigued.

787
01:24:17,454 --> 01:24:24,427
I love the artwork. There are many good panels and I know on on your Facebook site, you're going to features many on this one I can guarantee.

788
01:24:24,886 --> 01:24:34,102
I love commenting on those. But I will say it if the story unfolds well. Unlike a lot of the other stories mark when we've talked about them seemingly

789
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:41,805
rushed toward the end. This one glide nicely to the end. I I like the way this one wraps up in the last few pages.

790
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:53,173
And then leaves them on the beach without going back to Duck. We don't see uncle sc Al all in this story. The balance of everything is so wonderful. I love the break from the the funny animal characters.

791
01:24:53,632 --> 01:25:01,499
And for that reason, it's a memorable story, but also for that reason, it's probably not one of my favorite in terms of pure Ducktales stories

792
01:25:01,838 --> 01:25:17,749
because I'm a big fan of glad and sc and when when all that comes together, it's more of a fantasy. This had a real world feel in many ways. And that's why his editors didn't like it and cheating with death and hinting to get suicide and and

793
01:25:18,407 --> 01:25:20,146
guns and violence and

794
01:25:20,565 --> 01:25:22,662
even though it's part of the spy genre,

795
01:25:23,121 --> 01:25:24,394
very different for

796
01:25:25,212 --> 01:25:35,055
funny animal comics. And so he got away with a lot. And then I'll close by saying, we know this is the time when he was going through his messi divorce. He was I think

797
01:25:35,472 --> 01:25:45,004
separated for sure from his second wife and it was a difficult time for him, but it's interesting how he created this female character of great power

798
01:25:45,864 --> 01:25:55,328
and control as well. So boy, you had a great point there. Oh, that was a I didn't realize that. But your... The fact that they they never touched Duck,

799
01:25:56,105 --> 01:26:02,510
makes this feel a bit notable too. Well, that's why my favorite panel if you're gonna ask me what my favorite was, it was the very first panel.

800
01:26:03,029 --> 01:26:13,563
One of my favorite because I love the intro line that Donald and the nephews landed there because they he they got paid handsome by by Scrooge to get out of Duck. I just loved that. I

801
01:26:14,101 --> 01:26:14,340
Huey,.

802
01:26:15,033 --> 01:26:17,448
It's a good panel. Let's let's do

803
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:22,095
that... That's a great favorite panel. Any other panels you wanna highlight in this one?

804
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,229
I'll just...

805
01:26:23,709 --> 01:26:24,569
We're on that

806
01:26:24,909 --> 01:26:27,729
second to last page, and I i I think the

807
01:26:28,109 --> 01:26:32,900
the federal Ducktales with all question Barks is a really unique panel. You don't see that a lot.

808
01:26:33,638 --> 01:26:36,455
I love, of course, we we've talked about the

809
01:26:36,769 --> 01:26:40,265
the six gangster all pointing guns to each other is probably

810
01:26:40,764 --> 01:26:49,154
the most intriguing panel. That's it for me. I'll I'll let you and Sarah kinda talk about your panels. Sure. Any any that stand to you, Sarah?

811
01:26:49,814 --> 01:26:55,114
I did wanna point out at the very beginning. One of my favorite panels is

812
01:26:55,668 --> 01:27:02,591
two of the boys sing, there's a guy that looks like a spy, he could hide the plans of a battleship in those whisk

813
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:07,235
and the the guy is has a kind of a z top

814
01:27:07,573 --> 01:27:15,152
type long long long long long beard that so long it's curling up and it just reminded me of mean girls when

815
01:27:15,729 --> 01:27:19,000
when they say, that's why her hair is so big. It's full of secrets.

816
01:27:20,414 --> 01:27:20,914
Nice.

817
01:27:21,334 --> 01:27:26,209
I have to again come back to that big counter counter spy that

818
01:27:26,549 --> 01:27:38,338
that one really stuck with me. I couldn't remember much of this story when I went back to read it. You know? Because this is one that I don't think I didn't reread this as often as I read some of my other favorites.

819
01:27:38,857 --> 01:27:43,604
And I think that is because it's stood out to me as so different

820
01:27:44,341 --> 01:27:48,330
and dark. And I can probably appreciate it more these days.

821
01:27:48,983 --> 01:27:54,189
Yeah. This is a great story. It's it's not one of my favorites, but I definitely

822
01:27:54,885 --> 01:28:02,785
recognize it's greatness for a lot of reasons and it is it is fun and delightful. The community, I did mention,

823
01:28:03,563 --> 01:28:06,900
this is well regarded by the community. This is almost

824
01:28:07,453 --> 01:28:36,038
talk to... As of right now, index has this one ranked eleven. Out of all, you know, forty one thousand some Disney stories good for an eight point four. So it does not get much better than this one as far as the community goes. I I think some of that reputation is just because of how it stands out in people's mind, but it is it is definitely a great, ina a great story. As far as other reflections go, you know, it...

825
01:28:36,417 --> 01:28:52,434
I think it holds up pretty well. You were saying Sarah, there's not a whole lot here. Some of the, like, just the fe fatal patel idea feels kind of dated, but it also feels kind of timeless. It's too bad that there was never a lit graph for this one. Right? Warren?

826
01:28:53,088 --> 01:28:55,066
There wasn't one for dangerous

disguise. I think, well, I i to imagine, I'm surprised when Carl Barks took control of his oil paintings and his his photographs that he didn't include this in that canon of work, but he didn't. I think it would have been wonderful

828
01:29:09,213 --> 01:29:13,768
to see something like that. Did you ever see the Dawn Rosa poster

829
01:29:14,428 --> 01:29:17,828
that he did as a tribute for this one? I didn't.

830
01:29:18,923 --> 01:29:28,558
Okay. So you gotta look that one up. I'll definitely share that on the Facebook page when we released. See Don Rose, it didn't some poster for this one. And he even included

831
01:29:28,898 --> 01:29:32,118
a cameo of himself as an audience member

832
01:29:32,498 --> 01:29:33,259
in the bowl.

833
01:29:34,513 --> 01:29:43,473
Let's see. You guys... We we've said a lot about this great story. I'm about ready to wrap it up, but do you guys have any final thoughts you wanted to mention?

834
01:29:44,326 --> 01:29:47,219
Warren. Great story. Again, great great

835
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:49,691
plot twists and the whole genre

836
01:29:50,587 --> 01:29:59,202
just really came alive with me with this story. And I'll just highlight again, the human characters were to me of great plus in the storytelling.

837
01:30:00,379 --> 01:30:02,774
And I'm so glad Carl Barks got away with it.

838
01:30:03,589 --> 01:30:08,849
Again, a plus for his bravery in doing this and I think his confidence is an artist and a storyteller

839
01:30:09,789 --> 01:30:17,624
really peaked here. Well, sad, how about you, sarah? I mean I already said the thing that I I love Georgia corn.

840
01:30:17,964 --> 01:30:29,070
I just wanna be her so bad. Yeah. She's great. Hey. I'm I'm really glad that we got to do one that you you got some real genuine enjoyment out of too. Oh Thank you.

841
01:30:30,122 --> 01:30:34,291
I think this worked out great you guys. Thanks for bringing two different

842
01:30:34,708 --> 01:30:35,386
perspectives in.

843
01:30:36,224 --> 01:30:39,454
Had a lot of fun revisiting this one, I think it turned out great.

844
01:30:40,186 --> 01:30:53,754
Thanks, Mark. I really appreciate it, Sarah was really fun to to share this story with with you and and having the three of us poke Al a little bit and find out a little bit more about it. Yeah. Warren it was so good to to have another...

845
01:30:54,854 --> 01:30:57,073
Not just mark, but another

846
01:30:58,346 --> 01:31:06,529
one of the expert on these comics. I love being info dumped on. Awesome. I'm so glad I totally agree. Well, hopefully,

847
01:31:07,143 --> 01:31:13,476
hopefully, listeners enjoyed it as well. And hopefully, they'll come back next time to listen

848
01:31:13,816 --> 01:31:25,089
