1
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:08,874
we.

2
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:32,405
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Mc Ducktales writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge con of all time time. This episode is a ten page podcast, all about one of his short stories get ready to enjoy our remarks.

3
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:37,315
Alright. So welcome back Barks remarks listeners. We've got a special

4
00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:44,200
episode today. This is the first of what I am calling the ten page podcast. This is not a regular

5
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:50,879
episode of Barks remarks. So I'm I'm leaving it number but in these episodes, we will be to discussing

6
00:00:51,457 --> 00:00:59,581
one to two of Barks famed ten page stories. I've got a great conversation planned with this Halloween

7
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:00,595
themed

8
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:07,395
episode that is going to be all about Donald Duck worst nightmare. So

9
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:09,050
I'm gonna let my guests

10
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:15,343
introduced herself, tell us your name and and say something about Halloween.

11
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:17,161
Hi. I'm Sarah Santiago.

12
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,486
Returning guests. And halloween fan, but living in Scotland has made

13
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:35,650
celebrating halloween a little bit difficult because it's just a day here. It's not all month long spooky season. And then the architecture where I live is mostly, like, apartment building

14
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:40,459
type, you know, flat. It's really kind of dis

15
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:41,458
incentivizing

16
00:01:41,837 --> 00:01:42,337
to

17
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:46,505
have to climb up, like, five sets of stairs per building

18
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:49,179
for ten things of candy.

19
00:01:49,637 --> 00:01:57,495
Sure? It's it's definitely not as popular here I I... I'm a big sp season fan. You know, It's it feels like

20
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:20,340
I'm I'm game for it to bleed into the whole of October. So So... And do you have kids so you get to do trigger treating, which I miss from when my little sister was little. And then before that, from when I was little. Oh, yeah. Trick treating is like, the Al g, it's the best. So a lot like I mentioned, you know, I wanted to do a halloween soon. And and the natural

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,220
story for a Halloween

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,580
episode is

23
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:34,536
Carl Barks Trick treat. Right? It's the only... As far as I know, it's the only full length one that he did that was directly about Halloween needed a bunch of ten pager

24
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:35,509
But,

25
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:38,141
you know, I'm really trying hard to

26
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:54,267
stay true to my podcast format of doing them chronological as much as possible. So i think this is gonna be a nice way to kinda compromise on that and we'll see when Trucker treat actually comes out. But that one's a really fun one. It's based on

27
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,520
Al old donald Inducks Cartoon

28
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,260
that is directly halloween themed.

29
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:06,364
So this this one actually is gonna cover We... We're gonna be talking about Donald Duck worst nightmare.

30
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:11,388
Donald dot Worst Nightmare, or sometimes you see it as Deed worst nightmare is

31
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,954
not like, directly halloween themes, but it's very

32
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:37,810
scary. I think it's one of the more frightening looking ten pages around. So I feel like it's appropriate. We're gonna dive in have a little bit of fun for the ten page podcast. I'm giving myself permission to be a a little bit less research. Than I am for the Adventure stories. But how about you Sarah? Were were you able to to hold to that structure of of not researching this quite as much or or or not?

33
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:49,214
No. But thank you so much for dropping a new special interest directly into my lap that I didn't even know I would want to have. We can go into it when it comes up. But,

34
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:53,860
yeah, I went down the the a rabbit hole today for about two days.

35
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:58,749
Let's see. Let's do it. Donald Inducks

36
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,247
worst nightmare.

37
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:14,019
This one is published, you know, we're jumping around a little bit. The majority of our stories that we've covered have been part of the four color or one shot series that was put out by By del Western Publishing.

38
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:14,919
And

39
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:17,236
most of the ten pager

40
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:25,140
were released in the series Walt Disney comments and stories. And and this is a very long running comic series.

41
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:41,003
Until until it ended a few years ago, I I believe it was like for for a time, I believe it was the third longest running comic with series after like action comics, which has superman and detective comics which has batman. So this is a very

42
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:44,374
come line, a lot of it run

43
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:53,205
includes these Barks ten pager And and that's where Donald Duck wears nightmare Appeared in walt Disney comics and stories.

44
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:54,158
Number

45
00:04:54,535 --> 00:05:08,998
one hundred and one in nineteen forty nine, so we're not jumping around too much with this story. And then it's it's had quite a few reprint. It looks like it's had nine printing total in the Us counting that original one. And

46
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:18,784
we don't get to talk too much about daisy in the adventure stories. You know, he he kind of reserved her more for these short ten pager.

47
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:22,580
This is a nice appearance of Daisy duck here. And

48
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,715
are you are you ready to go right into the? South. Ready.

49
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:31,976
And again, this is it's certainly not like going to scare

50
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:35,446
anyone but it has much much more creepy

51
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:37,041
imagery than the typical

52
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:40,615
Disney's comments and story, ten pager debts.

53
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:46,555
So Donald Duck Worst nightmare opens right in the middle of him having a nightmare.

54
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:48,623
His his... The first nightmare

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,820
in the story involves him being chased by... What he calls men from Mars.

56
00:05:54,314 --> 00:06:03,667
And he's running. He's barely escaping them. He jumps off a cliff right into the gaping mall, the open mouth of a really

57
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:12,984
du looking like martian creature, and he wakes up screaming as one does from an nightmare and we get some nice spa

58
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:15,401
dialogue from him and the kids.

59
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:25,396
Where, you know, we we learned that he's been having these really bad nightmares it's nine so far this week and each one has been worse than the last.

60
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:26,295
And

61
00:06:26,872 --> 00:06:40,449
you know, I I read this at age eight or nine and was really struck by how creepy those men from Mars, those Martian monsters were Sarah. Well, you're in luck because I am your resident Barks expert

62
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,649
due to my undergraduate

63
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,182
work being in planning terry geology.

64
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,769
And I did wanna point out that... At this time,

65
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:54,528
we did believe that Barks supported life. There are...

66
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:56,401
I I remember

67
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:57,238
seeing

68
00:06:57,655 --> 00:06:58,155
national

69
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:02,000
graphics, which you've said that Carl Barks was very into.

70
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:05,714
Showing what we now know are dust storms

71
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:18,289
basically changing the, you know, color of the surface of Mars that at that time we're mis misinterpreted as seasonal vegetation. It's amazing. You know, with vegetation,

72
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:26,737
they were thinking, oh, maybe there's life too. So people got very imaginative over here on the creative side. Right? So

73
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:28,355
then from Mars,

74
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:30,629
could have been a very real

75
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,770
scary thing.

76
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:42,386
But you know, you couldn't fat check. Right. These these struck me as is really interesting. You know, like, kind of not just like, oh, he's having

77
00:07:42,802 --> 00:08:18,596
scary nightmares about men from Mars. But, like, now they're kind of fodder from kids to have these nightmares as well. I guess, this is a few decades from when that they used to believe they were canal. Right? Some of the the Geologic... Oh, yeah. Yeah. Very cool. So on the next page, you know, the Nephews are talking with Donald about He's gotta to take care of his insomnia. He needs to see a doctor, and he says he was... He he did. He was prescribed some sleeping pills, but he's he needs to be convinced to try the sleeping pills. The nephews hope that he'll just sleep so soundly He won't have dreams.

78
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:27,553
But sure enough, we're gonna transition to his his next nightmare which has him driving just about the world's most perilous

79
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,386
Mountain Roadway.

80
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:34,859
And this this is very stressful to me. I've driven on a couple of

81
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:43,801
mountain paths like this. And if you're ever on one of these, it it's terrifying. And so I can feel my stress level rising.

82
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:52,495
As I read this story as he is rounding a sharp curve onto an oil slick and tumble off the cliff,

83
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,850
transitioning to the Nephews calling for a doctor

84
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,663
in the wake of this next nightmare. Right. He is It's kind of a universal

85
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:08,830
scary dream. And so I have a version. I even had it two or three nights ago where I'm

86
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:14,065
stepping on the brakes and pulling up on the emergency break, and I just cannot

87
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:16,023
stop from coast

88
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:41,319
or, you know, sliding or hitting, you know, tapping whatever in front of me. Yeah. And that itself is a very adult dream. Right? Like that's not something that a kid would have because they don't have the experience driving that we do. The... It's... So it's not a driving dream. It's a falling dream anybody could be a passenger in a car on one of these cliff side highways that falls, and that's universally

89
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:41,815
terrifying.

90
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:54,475
That's a good point. You know, a lot of these nightmares that he has are kind of these these universal experience. And and the dialogue and these, I think it's worth noting that Barks really sets up how terrified

91
00:09:54,892 --> 00:10:09,801
and how life ruining these are right now for Donald. The most awful cliff I ever saw, and then a sharp curve ahead oil on the road, and my brakes are shot. You know, it's just... Like I said, very stressed full very suspense building,

92
00:10:10,178 --> 00:10:22,910
and the looks of terror on these pages that Bark straws for donald, I think are are a lot worse than they are in the adventure stories because, you know, Donald really believes himself to be a moment

93
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:28,959
from death because these are nightmares. Right? So on the following page, you know, they've summoned the doctor

94
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:31,356
and we get this sort of

95
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:32,235
list

96
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:46,305
set up. Right, Ducktales has already tried remedy number one, it was implied to be the sleeping pills and now we're on to remedy number two. This is a a trope that he uses a lot. You know? This is... This makes for for an easy

97
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:47,745
sort of storytelling

98
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:58,224
device. Where we go down this list. Right? So remedy number two is the doctor describes it the very like Late forties looking doctor describes it Al

99
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:03,307
exercises to relax his thinking nerve. He must work at something.

100
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:16,295
But he hates very much to do. And and it's funny than nephew you say he hates to do anything. So the doctor presents him. Do you... Do you wanna describe Sarah let the doctor produce and him as his suggestion.

101
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:24,675
The doctor puts away his stethoscope after listening to doctor to Donald head, of course because that's what you do with the stethoscope.

102
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:31,866
Right. And he pulls out a little circle of What we'll see very soon is a do.

103
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:34,698
U. He's holding it very delicate

104
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:39,990
his little pink are up. Would you like to crochet little toiletries?

105
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,270
Of course, that's terrifying to Donald Crochet.

106
00:11:45,144 --> 00:11:45,644
Yeah.

107
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:52,255
He he explodes with with just otter horror and content contempt. Right? Wait.

108
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:59,210
Make lakes like girls and old ladies do? I'd rather be boiled in prune oil.

109
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:08,016
So based on that response, you know, with his completely made a protocol here the doctor decides that this is perfect. He's got a crochet

110
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:18,553
This is going to quote relax your nervous tension and you'll sleep like a tired log. So Donald that we transitioned to Donald crochet bus,

111
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:33,686
while simultaneously just stew and freaking out about how he'll be disgraced forever if any of his friends hear about it. And he's he's drifting off to sleep, and, unfortunately, he does transition into another nightmare

112
00:12:34,262 --> 00:12:41,641
into a hire dream where he's about to be made to walk the plane. So I did wanna comment on crochet,

113
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:48,675
knit, you know, needle, yarn cross, of any kind. Yeah are they are a legitimate therapeutic

114
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:50,947
d dresser. I just read

115
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:52,142
burnout.

116
00:12:52,694 --> 00:12:55,870
By a couple of, you know, legitimate researchers

117
00:12:56,289 --> 00:13:03,320
on how to deal with burnout in your life and you know, taking up knit ing or crochet, etcetera etcetera was

118
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,360
legitimately

119
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:13,895
one of the tools that they recommended as far as what they call completing the stress cycle, but also it makes you feel

120
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:21,618
like you've accomplished some... They're very good. For getting your brain to calm down out of high stress

121
00:13:22,514 --> 00:13:22,952
situations.

122
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:31,410
So so this doctor is is he's a little bit of a quack. But he's also got a a real protocol that has some.

123
00:13:31,988 --> 00:13:37,696
It really does. It... No. You're right. It really does. You're doing something that requires you to focus

124
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:40,892
by nature very peaceful very medi.

125
00:13:41,391 --> 00:13:55,474
You know what? What stays in my mind about this. What kind of makes this story live in my brain is Donald response to it. Right? This is, like, classic, I I have to present myself as a human man. I can't how myself.

126
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:58,831
I think every time we've got like a sports championship,

127
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:02,845
There tends to be some story about how one of the athletes

128
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:08,165
will center himself by doing this. While he's on the side hands

129
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:14,482
You know, it... It's still notable. Right? We still give him this kind of like, oh, this is kind of sub

130
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:24,965
because he's like this mainly athlete and he's knit. Right. That was kind of the the rabbit hole I went down into today. The history of knit the history of crochet,

131
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,495
and the history of men's

132
00:14:27,873 --> 00:14:28,373
involvement.

133
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,362
In those activities. Right, You know, we have a lot of evidence

134
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:35,572
a lot of other crafts, but not so much

135
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:45,135
knit because what knit unit soft things that degrade very very fast. And then in Europe, we... In the thirteen fifties,

136
00:14:45,674 --> 00:14:48,630
we see the emergence of the knit Madonna.

137
00:14:49,204 --> 00:14:55,377
Theme in arts. So you have, you know, Jesus kinda hanging around, doing baby things and mary

138
00:14:55,756 --> 00:15:14,894
knit, and that is kind of an indicator that it was a thing at that point. That was done by women in the home. Right? But of course, and picture it. You you say the knit madonna and I can immediately picture it. Yeah. But then of course, things that are used full and can be,

139
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:20,730
you know, are taken over by men and they start to create guild, knit and guild.

140
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:31,339
In in France first. And then of course, They spread to Europe, And basically, it was it was always a thing that men did. You you see old paintings of shepherd

141
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:37,954
knit while they're watching their fox. And then now point, it clearly became

142
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:45,617
rebate. In World war one, the men were sent off, women were left behind and to support the war effort.

143
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:47,650
The women were asked

144
00:15:48,068 --> 00:16:21,655
to knit cold weather Gear. And it looks like it never really changed back into a thing that everybody does. In one generation, and then with the advent of sort of mass media, that that could be the death of of something. Right. It just fell out a fashion completely in the eighties once once those kids from that time of austerity got to the age where they were adults in making their own decisions. It fell into a big decline. But in the twenty first, century, we're seeing a huge resurgence. Right? Have a hobby.

145
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:26,164
Yeah. But it's not a necessity As we're re examining

146
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:28,881
gender and gender roles.

147
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:40,207
We see a lot more men entering the field. Right? So what Donald is that being asked to do though is crochet, and Crochet was developed in a lot of ways to be an... A cheaper

148
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:42,404
less labor intensive

149
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:51,990
alternative to lace snake. And so that's why it's a pretty little do that the doctor is holding up. So we are

150
00:16:52,608 --> 00:17:00,922
in the midst of Donald nightmare, his new nightmare on the next page where he is surrounded by very ferocious.

151
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:05,610
Hungry looking sharks. We transition, you know, the nephews are

152
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:07,009
calling the doctor,

153
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:14,820
know, saying we've gotta gone to remedy number three. But he cautions them that, you know, that's only for the the most desperate cases.

154
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:25,189
He needs to keep it up with the crochet toilets leads. And so We transitioned to him the next night again, drifting off while he's crochet,

155
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:35,372
and, unfortunately, it's into another night marie he seems to be in the great north somewhere, and he has wolves on his tail. And the last panel

156
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:41,565
He he says every time I look back, I see more wool must be ten thousand.

157
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:50,211
That just felt very like night. To me, right? The way he described that. That seems like how nightmares work. You know, you would Severino

158
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:53,920
you wouldn't really encounter that many walls. But in your nightmare, it makes sense.

159
00:17:54,693 --> 00:18:12,603
Exactly. One of the things art wise that I found kind of cute was the that the sharks that were circling him after he walked the plank and the wolves both had their tongues out. Right. Yeah. That's what sharks do. They've got these, like, very cartoon ish hungry brands.

160
00:18:13,241 --> 00:18:21,980
Yeah. Somehow to me, it makes them almost like more malevolent like they're going to take pleasure in eating him, not just not just eating him for assistance.

161
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,900
Absolutely.

162
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,909
On that next page, you know, we transitioned to the end of this wolfe nightmare. And he's

163
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:32,698
trying to get away, but he's just fallen Al eye

164
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:59,172
clinging two Barks and he's fallen again into there. Into their gaping laws. And so this time, the nephews have called the doctor again and asked okay. What what is remedy number three? And, you know, the doctor kinda braces them that this is for it's the only remedy in the world that is worse than the ailments and he tells them that their uncle needs to be frightened by something that is more horrible

165
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:03,505
than he can experience in dreams. To right And so the nephews

166
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:16,585
kinda steal themselves and they figure out that the best thing that they can do is to get a Barks in the scariest thing that they can get in their town. And as they're coming back with the Barks skin Donald, is again drifting off while crochet,

167
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,461
and he has

168
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:25,645
and encountered an open cage at the Zoo with the lion about to pound on him. And so on the next page,

169
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:33,260
you know, he's trying to get away from the lions, the nephews and counter him in mid tier as he's being attacked by the lines.

170
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:50,644
They... They hand to mind attacking him as the Barks, and he just... He just kicks the the fake Barks in the butt and says graham Ruined to to a guy who's just been eaten by a lion, you're not even a good shutter. I I like that line. I think that's some good sharp dialogue there.

171
00:19:51,262 --> 00:19:52,561
So, you know, the nephews

172
00:19:52,980 --> 00:20:00,586
they've failed, they kinda go off probably to return the Barks skin on their way through town, they encountered daisy.

173
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:21,190
And she is naturally, like, puzzled that why they've got this Barks skin. They they kind of are too worn out probably to think about, you know, that Donald does not want his dirty secret here exposed. They explain what's going on. To Daisy and tell tell her that he's got this do treatment

174
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:27,202
And Sarah, you wanna tell us about her response and any thoughts you've got? Crochet dual,

175
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:28,917
Donald Crochet,

176
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:30,810
that I must see.

177
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:32,427
She's she's genuinely

178
00:20:32,804 --> 00:20:39,221
excited and and and happy and It it doesn't seem like it's a ton kind of

179
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:40,674
delicious, like, oh,

180
00:20:41,512 --> 00:20:45,002
I'd I love to see this this thing that is

181
00:20:45,555 --> 00:20:47,655
beneath him. You know, I wanna see him

182
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:50,255
suffer. Right? She's genuinely

183
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:50,995
excited.

184
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:58,213
Right. Yeah, she she wants to appreciate it. She thinks it sounds darling. This is obviously

185
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,247
not gonna make Donald feel

186
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:01,683
feel empowered

187
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:23,755
or like he's accomplished something, but she's very excited for him. She... So he... I guess, you know, she could react He could've have chosen to depict her thinking that he was less of a man. And he chose not to. He's obviously got this other point of view that he's gonna express through Donald And I can't tell whether bark

188
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:31,290
himself. Feels more like daisy about it or donald about it or both. You know what I mean? I think that's an interesting

189
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:32,924
observation.

190
00:21:33,563 --> 00:21:35,462
Overall, I would say that he's

191
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:36,381
feeling

192
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,658
the way that Donald feels about it and kind of

193
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:41,096
that attitude.

194
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,428
Right. I think he's still writing a character

195
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:57,180
in daisy that he may not identify with. But is still capable of writing a character with different views than he has. Yeah. I I think you're probably right. And I think the only thing

196
00:21:57,518 --> 00:22:03,650
about it is that he really does present donald Al just being utterly over the top. Right? Like,

197
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:09,085
his his rev is is is truly ridiculous in this. So

198
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:16,285
there might be some commentary on how silly this is. But, you know, he he just so naturally falls into that

199
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,260
This is such a city pursuit. Right. He's... And he's writing... He's writing an

200
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,715
insecure man extremely well. You know, whatever

201
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:27,595
insecurities

202
00:22:27,935 --> 00:22:29,955
Donald Duck has, whether it his masculinity

203
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:44,623
or anything else. Barks really understands them and for portrays them very well. Yeah. There are gonna be a lot of these stories where Donald is very concerned with being quote, a hem. You know, this is...

204
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:55,860
They literally use that term key in in a lot of these, which really fast needs me because today it's it's it's it's priority, right? That the term itself is ridiculous.

205
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,491
So We transitioned to Daisy meeting up with a friend of hers.

206
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,519
As far as I know, we never encounter this friend again. She's

207
00:23:06,096 --> 00:23:24,736
she's named miss Double chin. This is which I think references that she's a turkey. They're kind of scheming to to encounter Donald Crochet she and and her friends as a man who crochet this is just darling and it and that's all they're interested in. Right? They think this is just darling.

208
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:33,440
But the the use of that word, you know, is kind of pointing to how their viewpoint is in.

209
00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:35,677
Right? Yeah. Darling

210
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,330
isn't a masculine

211
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:38,848
or even a neutral

212
00:23:39,347 --> 00:23:43,163
word? No. It's it's you're you're absolutely right. It's a very

213
00:23:43,582 --> 00:23:44,082
fe

214
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:48,730
word and and also a little maybe a little bit in in infant.

215
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:49,429
Right.

216
00:23:50,148 --> 00:23:51,860
Because it it really implies

217
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:54,315
something that is cute. Mh.

218
00:23:54,994 --> 00:24:04,488
And and so Donald is horror stricken that his secrets been revealed. He sees the two women approaching his house. He here their plans

219
00:24:04,946 --> 00:24:09,037
to have him give a talk on Crochet at their club meeting.

220
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:11,886
Or exhibit some of his doyle

221
00:24:12,623 --> 00:24:32,691
and and he lights out the window at the back of the house into his into his car, and he leaves and the women pursue him and a tax that they've just failed. And Right. So it's... I find it interesting that they want him to give a talk. Al the needle work club and exhibit the do.

222
00:24:33,324 --> 00:24:35,419
Because it speaks to how

223
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:44,568
they, you know, ema escalating language aside. They are genuinely interested. They do want to see good work They do want him to

224
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:51,171
participate and show off what a great job he's doing because he's doing a great job. Right?

225
00:24:51,745 --> 00:24:53,282
He he knew the language.

226
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:59,366
He is able to keep doing it without frustration. So he's probably doing it well.

227
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:03,944
That's right. But he he can't he can't take that compliment.

228
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:11,820
No. Because he's so afraid of it. But I did wanna talk about a little bit of the history of crochet in the Us.

229
00:25:12,318 --> 00:25:12,718
Right.

230
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:18,623
So it was became popular in Europe and the eighteen hundreds to em

231
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:21,457
ones that they already had. Callers,

232
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:24,052
you know, just any little... Anything

233
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:27,582
that could just make it a little bit less

234
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:30,059
dreary. Right? And specifically,

235
00:25:30,518 --> 00:25:34,823
what Donald is doing is was introduced to the Us

236
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:59,030
from Irish people who are fleeing the Family, or nice. And then when they immigrated to the Us, you know they they introduced it to the people of the Us. Right? In Ireland, it was a thing that men and women in children all did. You're not gonna code something that that's gonna sustain you as only for one gender. Right. And then coming to the Us

237
00:25:59,448 --> 00:25:59,948
afterwards,

238
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:03,300
it does seem to have followed the same path as

239
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:10,190
knit has where it you know, where it becomes something that just women do. But it crochet was

240
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:29,923
an aren't that men utilized two for manly things because they needed to make and mend nets and and such for hunting and fishing. Oh, yeah. That makes sense. Right? A lot of these... A lot of these crafts were born out of just necessity and survival. You know, I'm reflecting

241
00:26:30,235 --> 00:26:37,776
that I've probably literally never said the word doyle out loud in my life before recording this podcast. Right?

242
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:49,052
Would you say that they're archaic now? Or is that just because I'm I'm a dude? No. You're you're absolutely right, and it as we moved away from handmade

243
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:50,690
decorations,

244
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:54,061
it did kind of become the realm of

245
00:26:54,599 --> 00:27:00,248
grandparents. And it's it's not a thing that with the kind of resurgence

246
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:05,770
in interest in these craft in the twenty first century has really

247
00:27:06,148 --> 00:27:12,408
taken hold again. Right? We don't to... We don't feel like we have to put a do down

248
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:27,800
on our console table before we put a lamp down. Right? Right. In the way that we used to. Yeah. That that to me feels very old fashioned. Right? And and it also feels a little bit fancy. Right? Like, I associate it with, like, high tea almost Oh, absolutely.

249
00:27:28,698 --> 00:27:35,031
So, you know, we're kind of entering us a high comedy part of this story, right, where

250
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:43,076
This is gonna be Barks case. Yes. Yeah. We're we're in a car chase here and it's been a transition to this over the top pursuit.

251
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:47,991
By the women of Donald, and he's about to basically enter

252
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:50,111
his own version.

253
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:55,512
Of remedy number three. Right? He's he's he is so disgusted

254
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,108
at the prospect

255
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,435
of having to

256
00:27:59,772 --> 00:28:00,870
with these women

257
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,381
about his hobby now,

258
00:28:03,957 --> 00:28:13,546
which to be fair to him, I don't ever get the impression. I do... I get the impression that he's good at it. I don't get the impression that he enjoys it. Add any break.

259
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,974
Well that was the whole point that it was something that he didn't want to do. Right. And I don't think he ever

260
00:28:20,353 --> 00:28:30,811
comes to to enjoy it. I could easily see the story having taken the large that he comes to enjoy it, and, you know, maybe still feels and secure about it. But...

261
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:35,461
That's not the case. Right? He he never he never comes around to this,

262
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,318
and he's just

263
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:38,755
completely horrified.

264
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:43,358
Al being discovered. So so we're transitioning into

265
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:52,664
his actual nightmare come to life. Right? He he drives up this terrible Mountain Trail he plunge off a cliff. He lands,

266
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:56,731
he lands into what he identifies as the pool at the shark farm,

267
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:59,776
you know, with which it's ridiculous. Right? Because you don't

268
00:29:00,396 --> 00:29:04,496
As far as I know, you don't farm sharks, at least not of that size,

269
00:29:04,836 --> 00:29:05,336
but

270
00:29:05,796 --> 00:29:12,618
but it works for the context of the story. He does mention, you know, this is as bad as those night nightmares I've been having. And

271
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:13,974
once he

272
00:29:14,312 --> 00:29:17,741
once he emerges from the Barks pond on the next page,

273
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:34,841
He's confronted by Daisy and her friend having caught up with him. He has to decide is he gonna... Is he gonna try to get past them? Or is he gonna go back and try and get through those sharks and he does he chooses the sharp and he... He punches his way past them saying I said Van Moose.

274
00:29:35,494 --> 00:29:42,906
And, you know, I think we need to bring back memos. I really love the word demos. I do see that in a lot of these stories.

275
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,180
It's definitely a a word that I remember from these kinds of cartoons.

276
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:55,435
Right. And I think it comes from the Spanish Bam. I think it's just like a option

277
00:29:55,736 --> 00:29:55,896
an

278
00:29:56,656 --> 00:30:01,366
Negotiation of Domino's let's go, but so so the women

279
00:30:01,744 --> 00:30:02,923
after he emerges,

280
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:10,699
miss K, she she kinda figures out that he's deliberately swimming away from them. So they know that they're they're not welcome here.

281
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:14,671
They pursue him... He's hiding out in the trees,

282
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:16,268
and daisy

283
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:19,472
separate so that she can call in the cavalry.

284
00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:22,899
She gets on the phone. It's and

285
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:24,866
they they get together their

286
00:30:25,563 --> 00:30:26,980
companions for needle,

287
00:30:27,516 --> 00:30:35,331
a flying squadron of companions of needles were. Her friend is supposed to call the members of the petite padding circle.

288
00:30:35,991 --> 00:30:41,831
It's just this this great... The point Embroidery Club and the Tuesday chatting circle.

289
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:42,551
Right.

290
00:30:43,364 --> 00:30:48,295
This is Barks idea of what ladies clubs are, and I'm sure that there's some truth into

291
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,213
this

292
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:52,047
in this era. Right? This was probably

293
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,059
probably his observation.

294
00:30:54,678 --> 00:30:57,435
And it's it's certainly a cara, but it's funny.

295
00:30:58,195 --> 00:31:06,466
And then know... Her friend is missus Chatter. This is Chatter. Yes. Of course because the... These are the women who are getting together to

296
00:31:06,806 --> 00:31:08,626
do their craft and gossip.

297
00:31:09,006 --> 00:31:18,632
Is is what's implied. Right? What else are you gonna do? Right. And and and then have this kind of thing too, but it's coded differently. Right? And... Well, absolutely is not.

298
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:22,139
At least not viewed to be about gossip.

299
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:29,175
You know, everything kinda comes to head on the last page of the story where he's swinging through the trees,

300
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:32,961
it's striking me that that's maybe supposed to evo Tarzan.

301
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:37,844
Right, who is one of these he, man. Key men, and he runs out of trees

302
00:31:38,223 --> 00:32:15,796
right over the Lions cage at the zoo. And again, he's confronted with this decision because there are there hundreds of of women now in closing closing in on him. And he's so he... He has this panel where he has to decide is he gonna allow himself to be caught and he thinks this is worse than any nightmare I ever had and he makes the... The ten thousand women in closing on him are scarier than the ten thousand wolves. Right. Right. And and so he says out of my way, Tab cats, I guess you're not so terrible

303
00:32:16,216 --> 00:32:39,419
after all. And and we we close out the story, it transitions to days later, we come to understand that Huey, Dewey Louis have been frantically searching for their uncle who's gone missing since. And they're asking a zoo keeper who is bathing like the world's cutest little baby giraffe And it washed right in a flash tub. But if if he has seen their uncle.

304
00:32:40,156 --> 00:32:49,923
And and, apparently the Zoo keeper has. He confirms is he a little guy about so high. Huey, let the nephews know that he's been living in the Lions cage.

305
00:32:50,380 --> 00:33:00,754
He sleeps sixteen hours of stretch wakes up yells, I'm cute. I'm cured and goes back to sleep again. And and story.

306
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:06,598
And this just it's very funny. Right? It's... It is

307
00:33:07,175 --> 00:33:12,956
unbelievably dependent on this idea of of I'm gonna say the words toxic masculinity.

308
00:33:13,453 --> 00:33:14,152
Oh, absolutely.

309
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,548
Right. So

310
00:33:15,886 --> 00:33:20,669
it's only funny if I think if you read it as this, like, cultural

311
00:33:21,127 --> 00:33:22,225
artifact, just

312
00:33:22,563 --> 00:33:27,826
the... This notion that the very idea of a man being caught crochet.

313
00:33:28,364 --> 00:33:32,256
And and that man is so insecure that he would rather

314
00:33:32,714 --> 00:33:33,932
live with the lions

315
00:33:34,325 --> 00:33:34,825
basically.

316
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:42,786
It's very over the top. It's very funny. I remember even as a kid reading this thinking. That's pretty weird.

317
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,740
That's.

318
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,923
But you know what? There were so many of these expressions

319
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,477
of of

320
00:33:50,854 --> 00:34:20,824
security in culture sure that it didn't seem that weird to me. Oh I would have picked up on it immediately. I was I was tuned in to this kind of, you know, double standard my earliest memory was at age three. I was walking out the door to join my dad and my uncle who were fixing the car in the garage. And my mom yates me back in and made me wear a shirt and I did not think it was fair, then they didn't have to wear a shirt. It's Arizona.

321
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:23,494
It's hot but I did.

322
00:34:23,926 --> 00:34:26,066
Right. Ever since then, I've been very

323
00:34:26,686 --> 00:34:27,186
very

324
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:28,026
sensitive

325
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:32,839
to those kinds of things. I would seen it, but I I wouldn't have

326
00:34:33,177 --> 00:34:41,493
necessarily thought like, oh, this is a thing that society should change. I would have just seen it as a... Oh, this is fair. Yeah. Kind of personal thing. Excellent.

327
00:34:41,925 --> 00:34:54,078
And and that's to your credit. I don't think I was completely oblivious because, like, I didn't I didn't have a lot of the interest that a lot of the other boys did. Right? Like, I enjoyed some sports, but I was never

328
00:34:54,455 --> 00:34:57,228
animated by, like, football or wrestling.

329
00:34:57,606 --> 00:34:59,002
Even as I read these comments,

330
00:34:59,856 --> 00:35:17,629
themselves. Right? I read these when I was older. And I I always felt very sensitive to the facts that, like, most kids if they were into comic books heavily, they were gonna be into the superhero comments. Right? So I always felt like oh it's, you know, but it's certainly nothing like the

331
00:35:17,966 --> 00:35:58,778
expression of deeply masculine and security that Donald has in this story. And it's It's so funny. This one really stands out to me when I started this podcast and I was thinking back on these ten pager, I was like I didn't Severino reread them as frequently as I already read the adventure stories. Right? Because the... Those are the ones that really call more attention themselves. But I'd I'd say seventy or eighty percent of what Barks did are these ten pages and even shorter little gigs. So this is a huge part of his work. But this one stands out to me. I find this story very memorable for those two reasons. Right? We've got this, like, over the top toxic masculinity

332
00:35:59,435 --> 00:36:15,791
and then these the nightmares themselves make this very memorable because I think they're they're scarier than what you usually find in a funny animal comic. Even bark other ten pages of this era. When did you when did you think of the story itself? Absent

333
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:19,472
just, you know, what it had to say about masculinity

334
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:20,591
and

335
00:36:21,452 --> 00:36:21,952
men's

336
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:24,526
interest in in these now

337
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:27,926
hobbies. I mean, can you separate it from?

338
00:36:28,426 --> 00:36:29,406
I don't know.

339
00:36:30,706 --> 00:36:33,660
The elements of it you know, the the scary

340
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:40,412
and the him over overcoming a fear by, you know, doing something scarier. Those are really very

341
00:36:40,846 --> 00:36:51,142
real and human. Right? There are some things that I'm no longer scared of because I've done scarier things or survived worse situation.

342
00:36:51,522 --> 00:36:55,462
Right. You know, maybe it could have been a different driver that was.

343
00:36:57,135 --> 00:37:03,264
Making him run away and face all of these spears. But I think that's a good thing. To to show a character

344
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:07,270
who maybe even in panic but certainly

345
00:37:07,847 --> 00:37:27,476
once the panic passed, he's like, oh, yeah. Okay. I've processed that fear. Good. Yeah. I... I'm remembering now that there's a story that's similar to this where I think the nephews are trying to get away from spring cleaning. Right? There's something that's not quite as I mean, it's it's gender, but it's it's not as loaded as, like, Barks

346
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:33,543
sake. Right. So, yeah. I I try to think. Could you have made this story without that? Like, ear of

347
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:43,452
femininity, because it it is very baked in. But I do think that this story has a very cool progression right, in in ten quick pages.

348
00:37:44,032 --> 00:37:47,292
He he sets this up very snap.

349
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:50,386
And and it's a very fun story. It's

350
00:37:51,164 --> 00:37:53,702
it's toxic because Al get out. But

351
00:37:54,120 --> 00:38:19,378
But it's a great read with some really sharp I Al as far as panels that I really like, there are so many cool panels artistic in this. Anytime he's really trying to pick the fear you know, I see the Lions, the silhouette of the lions on the last page. Trying to reach Donald. That's just you the women in circling every every aspect of is drawing really conveys to me Donald

352
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:28,747
fear and error and this one. Mh. Yeah. This and and this one stands out, I think to a lot of fans as one that that rates pretty highly.

353
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:30,987
None of these ten pager

354
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:39,682
very few of them rather rank nearly as highly as most of his adventure stories if you look them up on Inducks. But I do know that this one...

355
00:38:40,062 --> 00:38:42,217
This one is Al little bit higher rated

356
00:38:42,676 --> 00:39:08,889
compared to most of the... Of his ten page stores. As far as the art goes, I love that I love how colorful it is right. And I love how fast the pacing is so that you don't have a whole page of being at the doctor's office. You don't have a page of swimming with sharks. You have such a quick transition that the pages are very... The pages are quite variable.

357
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:13,076
Right. It's very brisk. Right? Yeah. And and visually

358
00:39:13,732 --> 00:39:16,624
compelling. The drawings are so engaging,

359
00:39:17,096 --> 00:39:26,627
and so compelling. Right. And and yeah, his ten pager are very sharp. Very ready. You know, looking looking at where this one lands on index,

360
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:28,340
This is rated as

361
00:39:28,878 --> 00:39:38,870
the one hundred and ninety best of all the Disney comic stories. So this is probably in his top ten or so. Best remembered of the ten pages.

362
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:43,200
Yeah. So it's it's a well like story. That certainly hasn't

363
00:39:43,538 --> 00:39:47,001
aged very well as far as its gender politics

364
00:39:47,736 --> 00:39:59,872
aren't concerned. But I I love the nightmare nightmares. Stuff. That's basically where where I stand on this one. The nightmare stuff is so invent and so cool. It's a shame that it's

365
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,547
involves. Yeah. And the callbacks

366
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:19,862
to kind of each individual nightmare are very clever. Right? Like, he ends up, you know, falling down a cliff in a car like he did in his dream, and he ends up in a pool of sharks at the shop farm instead of jumping the, know, again, gender politics

367
00:40:20,202 --> 00:40:28,251
side I do like that, you know, he didn't end up with ten thousand little circling him. It was you know, a hundred and women or whatever.

368
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:38,895
Right. But the the fact that an illusion was made, you know, I can I can see that and and recognize it as a quality illusion even if

369
00:40:39,591 --> 00:40:44,412
the gender politics are so wrong. Yeah. It's it's a very invent

370
00:40:44,749 --> 00:40:46,823
i tightly paced story.

371
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:55,516
Alright. Well, Sarah, thanks for joining me and listeners. Thanks for joining us for this first of hopefully more ten page podcasts.
