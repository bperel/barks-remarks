00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:09,384
We have

2
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:32,235
Hello, and welcome to Barks Remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comics of all time. This episode is a ten page podcast, all about one of his short stories. Get ready to enjoy our remarks.

3
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:39,800
Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm mark Sever a Grown man who enjoys talking about du Comics.

4
00:00:40,293 --> 00:00:43,863
And I'm joined by a returning guest host who

5
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,447
I I forced to talk about and and think about

6
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:50,218
Could you

7
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:57,603
introduce yourself and and remind the audience your experience with the Carl barb? Com? Hi. I'm Sarah Santiago.

8
00:00:58,914 --> 00:01:01,049
I really first heard about them

9
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:08,120
and you started talking about them, and you're kind of literally my only connection to them, but

10
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,720
I've been... I haven't been forced. I've been willingly be joining you on this journey,

11
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,765
but this is my first time with them. And it's it's not necessarily

12
00:01:19,142 --> 00:01:25,045
my thing. So it's it's interesting to get experience with something that I wouldn't have sold out myself.

13
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:38,817
Yeah. And I and I really appreciate your perspective. You know, you're one of my Barks Newbies. I think that's something that really benefits the podcast. You know, I love to talk to fans and long timers, but I imagine that it's interesting for listeners

14
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:44,670
to hear someone talk about the stories from, like, that outside perspective.

15
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,685
Yeah. I hope that I bring a little bit of that but also kind of a a modern take on

16
00:01:51,545 --> 00:02:02,294
how how these stories have stood the test of time. Yeah. Absolutely. And And not something that I really think about, you know, I... Because I deeply love these stories, but these stories,

17
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,650
you know, they're they're from the forties fifties and sixties.

18
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:09,341
And that's quite a while ago and and cultural

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,398
attitudes and thoughts and more,

20
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:18,980
especially my own have changed. And there are definitely things about the Barks stories that haven't aged well,

21
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:22,571
you know, a lot from a cultural point of view and

22
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:28,649
I would say from an economic point of view, he he has a very

23
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:30,324
specific

24
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,930
sort of point of view. A lot of these stories. Let's say. And

25
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,890
that

26
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,690
listener

27
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:44,025
is what we're really gonna be talking about and thinking about today. I'm calling this

28
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:44,985
episode

29
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:46,705
screw genomics

30
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:50,114
because this is all about the

31
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,150
economics

32
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:54,179
the the sort of philosophy

33
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,972
that under underpins

34
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,017
some of these stories. And

35
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:07,610
we're we're really gonna use this framework to think about, you know, what what does Carl Barks think about wealth

36
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,930
and about...

37
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:21,419
What does he think about economics? What does he think about finance? And all the kind of systems that under it. What do you think Sarah? Is it silly you to think about economic economics from

38
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:28,345
in a in a funny animal chronic, but... I mean, if your goal is to propagate I the young kids, then

39
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:35,185
No. By all means to give them as much of your ideas as you can. But other than that,

40
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:36,605
So, I mean,

41
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:40,431
many many kids have have been

42
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:55,536
exposed to screws Mick dot as a character over over years. And there have been a lot of think pieces over the years about kind of the the attitudes that Barks has and sort of the the culture

43
00:03:57,606 --> 00:03:58,106
imperial

44
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:17,600
that is kind of inherent in in a lot of his stories. I think it's really interesting. I think if you If you really think about as stories as an overall body, you do get a pretty good idea of what the man thought about wealth money and economics. I would agree. And

45
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,015
today, we are gonna use that framework to talk about

46
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:27,375
a handful of stories. These are mostly gonna be focused on the ten pager

47
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:28,815
a financial

48
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:30,055
and

49
00:04:30,489 --> 00:04:39,280
spending money, but we're we're gonna touch on a few other stories that really go into what, you know, what Barks has to say about finance.

50
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:40,751
About economics.

51
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:49,175
So a a story that we previously covered, the the trouble with dimes will we'll likely touch upon.

52
00:04:49,552 --> 00:05:04,186
I recently got to talk about T law, which is a famous adventure story of his and is you know, very focused on kind of what happens Inducks closed economic system And then there's a a Goofy little five pager

53
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:21,266
called something fishy here. It's a light fluffy story. But again, it's it's really an interesting economics experiment. I have to say I love that Barks did this kind of thing. I love that he kind of explored these big ideas

54
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:24,819
from a comic book framework where... I think those, like,

55
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:31,328
five stories, you know, was five stories. Think you could you could probably do a Phd

56
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,520
on them as these kind of closed

57
00:05:34,938 --> 00:05:45,981
economics experiment Right? Mh. Maybe a masters. Maybe a mess. Yes. Now like, they're not true experiments. Right? They're there thought experiments because he

58
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:57,699
He's writing them, but but I I do think they have some interesting things to say. Let let... Let's pull back a little bit. What's which you're kind of... What's your kinda take on

59
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:00,579
Scrooge mick Ducktales

60
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,019
both a

61
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:03,059
protagonist

62
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:04,313
and

63
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:06,704
a capitalist

64
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,820
Ty

65
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:12,219
Cracked. Well, I think that it's interesting

66
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:13,419
to see

67
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:15,099
how the

68
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:16,699
about

69
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,679
have changed.

70
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:26,671
Time. I think if he were writing this today, there would be a lot more worship Scrooge

71
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,447
as a billion. Whereas

72
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:43,736
here it's just used as is plenty character traits. I do appreciate that in a financial table, there's a farm setting and farming as hard work. And he's in there doing it with everybody else. And so there's not an attitude

73
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:44,693
of

74
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,926
billionaires being better than

75
00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:50,886
other people or other people being

76
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:53,436
worthy or less worthy of

77
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:58,524
to bridge work. You know, I appreciated that. Yeah. It's it's a much more

78
00:06:59,024 --> 00:06:59,524
traditional

79
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:02,824
take on on kind of the myth of the the capital.

80
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,177
Right? Like the the hard working,

81
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:09,892
pull yourself up by your own boot straps. Definitely a different

82
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:13,383
form of blue crap. I think it's got

83
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:15,420
a lot of elements of

84
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,778
that earlier

85
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:18,975
brand of

86
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:25,742
rugged individual awesome right? Where the amount of effort you put in is the amount of earnings

87
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:34,010
you get out. Where it's evolved into a focus on of the other side of that coin. Which they're now more focusing on

88
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:34,847
where

89
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:39,540
if you are successful, it's your own fault and you deserve, you know,

90
00:07:40,536 --> 00:07:45,595
or misery or something else. Right. What... What's that called when you got it in the

91
00:07:45,932 --> 00:08:02,973
the religious framework? The isn't like... Well, the I was thinking the prosperity cost. Oh yeah. Let's see. So I don't know. I guess I'm really interested in the question of, like, are we supposed to like Scrooge mc dot? In these stories.

92
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:06,050
You know, I've I've talked with some guest hosts

93
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:08,127
where,

94
00:08:08,546 --> 00:08:11,539
like, one of them mentioned that she really appreciate.

95
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,059
He really

96
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:41,180
appreciates the fact that, like, Scrooge is not really a hero. You know, you you don't have to like him, but he's very interesting. And and I I like that. Right? I I like the idea that he is just He's a complex character. He's he's really interesting. There are definitely stories where we're meant to, like, route for him and support him. But but Barks had him be kind of like villainous in some stories

97
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:57,594
or at least last sim static. And and I think that's why he's ultimately a pretty interesting character. So I it makes me more comfortable to kind of enjoy these stories when I keep that in my back pocket like, oh, yeah. He's not

98
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:04,799
necessarily just He... He's the protagonist, but he's not a hero in all of. Yeah. That's a it's a really

99
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:05,719
complex

100
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,559
situation And you know, again, I'm I'm marvel at the amount of complexity

101
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:16,593
in these, you know, ten page tori and how really

102
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,063
Carl Barks develop his characters?

103
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:31,903
I don't know if we're supposed to like Scrooge, I don't know if we're supposed to, like donald even. I think if if we're talking about whether or not we should we are supposed to like characters,

104
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,014
the kids are the only ones that are

105
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:51,205
five likable. Yeah. I think I think that's right. I mean, he my take is that we we're not always supposed to Donald, but we're always supposed to relate to him. Right? We're we're supposed to see our our

106
00:09:51,544 --> 00:09:54,042
insecurities and our our weaknesses

107
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,650
but are, like, well meeting as well. In Donald.

108
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:06,520
And then screws, it's kind of the same thing, but but less about sort of the well meaning this and doubt definitely not

109
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,433
everyday. We're supposed

110
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,234
relate to him as a character who worked hard.

111
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:26,360
We're supposed to relate to him as someone who's just thrifty. We're supposed to kind of appreciate the I mean, he was really born out of like a one note joke. Right? Like har,

112
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:41,699
he sure does like money. Right? That's that's kinda how he like. That's the the reason he exists. He gave... He gave Barb this interesting framework to write all these scans. And when you look at like throw jokes,

113
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:50,330
where the whole thing is, he sure us like money, you know, kind of in that rich she rich. That... That's the joke. That's the entertaining part.

114
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:59,519
And so Barks did that's really interesting is he created this whole person son out of that that that is more than that. One notes

115
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,079
Throw away bit. So

116
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:02,934
let's

117
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:17,996
let's not get too into the weeds without talking about the stories themselves. What we're gonna do is we're we're gonna come back to to these ideas we're gonna be talking first about the story that's called a financial table.

118
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:20,231
And this one

119
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:28,875
was originally printing wall disease Comments and stories number one hundred and twenty six in March of nineteen fifty one.

120
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:36,934
That... That's during the height of Bark golden age. And I I'd mentioned to you Sarah that this is a very famous ten pager

121
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:42,920
very well loved and remembered by the community. A lot of people who grew up reading it probably

122
00:11:43,457 --> 00:11:48,516
remember as, like the corn crib story, you know, because this was un titled, but

123
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:49,433
it

124
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,174
is if you check it out on Inducks,

125
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:56,230
the site that where where fans can

126
00:11:56,569 --> 00:12:08,219
vote for, you know, ranked the stories essentially. It has a very high rating. It's it's number one hundred and twenty nine out of all, like, forty two thousand or so.

127
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:38,106
Stories that are listed on index. And if you break it out and just compare it to the other ten page stories, you know, they they bounce around a little bit. But in general, you'll find that it's well within the top five of all of his story. It is ranked number four right now. The the highest by the way, the highest ranked of those ten pages is the the trouble with dimes, which is another of the economic stories

128
00:12:38,844 --> 00:12:42,460
that kinda creates this, you know, closed sort of experiment.

129
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,990
So a financial favor

130
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:53,189
I think is rightly remembered by fans, and it's a very interesting story because it really is structured

131
00:12:53,647 --> 00:13:11,469
like a favor. Right? Let's go through it, and I'm just I'm gonna stop at the page break, and and I'd I'd love to hear your thoughts about this. Okay. I love that you just reached stuff and grabs your own copy of it. Yeah. So this this is

132
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:19,740
it's it's definitely Scrooge center story but it takes place from Donald point of view. And

133
00:13:20,054 --> 00:13:22,886
he is working on Scrooge

134
00:13:23,684 --> 00:13:26,816
farm. He and his nephews are hired hands

135
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:36,402
And we open on Donald doing something very very dawn leg. Right? He's he's grip about work and heating

136
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:44,419
work. And and right off the bat, this is pretty unusual setup up. Right? Because we don't associate Scrooge with having a far

137
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:48,763
The story is gonna make a lot of kind of weird

138
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,680
exceptions

139
00:13:50,335 --> 00:14:02,756
so that Barks can help this the unusual story that he wants to tell here. And we kinda go through the typical list of fun chores he's doing feeding pigs and milk cows.

140
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:10,594
And we transitioned to the nephews who are like the voice of reason in the story. And they're talking about donald,

141
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:11,674
Their uncle

142
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:14,954
complaining about work as usual.

143
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,594
And one of the nephews

144
00:14:16,894 --> 00:14:17,394
says

145
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:31,053
He's too young to understand things. That boy. And and he goes on to say if you're gonna wear warm wool jackets you gotta work to get the wool. And if you're gonna eat poached eggs on,

146
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:37,929
you gotta work to get the eggs. It's a very funny little bit of a smiling Nephew being Chase by an angry chicken.

147
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:40,289
For stealing a things.

148
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:40,749
Right.

149
00:14:41,629 --> 00:15:08,495
And and Donald, you know, kicks over the meal, he complains that he wishes he had a million dollars, so we wouldn't have to work. And the last panel of the page is where we first see Scrooge, and he's chi him that if you want a million dollars nephew, you gotta work for it. Nobody will give it. So what do you think of this openings, Sarah? It felt very much like something that we would hear. Nowadays.

150
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:14,975
Right, especially with our in our current economic crisis with the great resignation and and

151
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:21,410
labor shortage and nobody wants to work, you know, completely ignoring things like

152
00:15:21,747 --> 00:15:22,247
wage,

153
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:33,249
stag nation and how many people have had to leave the workforce for various reasons because of Covid, but the thing that again, it's stood out to me was

154
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:35,580
that Donald was...

155
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:38,134
So he's still... Scrooge is still

156
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:44,499
participating in the work that he's lecturing Donald about. Whereas, you know, reading this through our,

157
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,419
we would see

158
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,219
people lecturing,

159
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:54,859
you know, oh, you need to work, you know, but they would be saying it from their yacht. And they're, like, fancy

160
00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:56,612
beach vacations

161
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,259
and wearing their

162
00:15:58,678 --> 00:15:59,196
Gucci and.

163
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:03,285
Right? Like, Scrooge is right there in the trenches

164
00:16:03,742 --> 00:16:05,718
with donald Yeah. Absolutely.

165
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,433
Scrooge is definitely

166
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:16,346
not one... He you know, he he is walking the walk as well as talking to talk. So, you know, I think we alluded to

167
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:19,749
the idea of the protestant and work ethic briefly

168
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:36,819
already. But... But that's a big part of what this story is about. Right? The the the the idea of the product and ethic really under ge a lot of the kind of myth of Am america. Mh. And and it's the idea that there's really something inherent

169
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,539
and and hard

170
00:16:39,679 --> 00:17:00,652
just in the people that came that largely came to America. It feels very outdated to talk about now. It's very Ducktales. But... But this is like the myth. Right? This is the people pull themselves up by their own boot straps. And and that is the kind of character that's Scrooge legit. Right? He is self made

171
00:17:00,992 --> 00:17:12,299
as much as a a person can be So I I really like the opening. I I I shoot... I'm gonna lay my Barks out on the table. Right? Like, this is a complicated

172
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:20,310
story for me where I I both love it and I have some some big issues with. But Mh. But it's very tightly

173
00:17:20,729 --> 00:17:28,033
constructed. It is set up like a favor. There's a reason that the ultimate title they landed on, you know, is a financial.

174
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:35,188
Mh. So on the next page, you know, it it Donald continues to fetch

175
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:40,035
about working. And we get a very Scrooge interaction where he kicks him in the bum.

176
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:48,965
And tells him, I'm not paying you ten dollars a week to sit down, you know, think about a way to get out of work and Sp is thinking very kindly

177
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:50,934
about his net fuse

178
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:56,734
saying that they're different. He's gonna raise their wages just ten cents a week. Just because he really

179
00:17:57,074 --> 00:17:57,574
obviously

180
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,268
appreciates their work ethic and their attitude.

181
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:24,184
And Donald has this very, like, funny thought. While he's towing some plans that it be so much easier to just go to a store and buy these dogg on cucumbers or whatever they are. Right. And and this is a a big thing among people who consider themselves producers. Right? That like Citi folks don't

182
00:18:24,684 --> 00:18:27,904
understand where the food comes from, they're disconnected

183
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:29,264
to production

184
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:32,157
This is both like a funny

185
00:18:32,496 --> 00:18:42,798
hot take that that has been around for years. And and I feel like it is a fair true is Right? You do have a lot of people in the modern world who are

186
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:58,014
disconnected to kind of, like, where does their food come from I I mean, I think this is a very fair thought and he's he's making the rules in his favor here. Right. It's it's a good example of going back to the concept

187
00:18:58,432 --> 00:19:06,886
of using this kind of thing in a story. Right? It is a good teaching tool. For teaching

188
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:07,842
kids

189
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:09,436
how their

190
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:21,065
food is produced and how it's kind of been removed from City life and oh, well you know, you have to grow the food in order to buy it. And from

191
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:29,019
the store. And Donald is demonstrating that really well even though he's in the middle of apartment so... Right...

192
00:19:30,193 --> 00:19:36,876
It's also a great dis installation of how under under a capitalist system, we convert our labor

193
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:43,306
into money and and then into goods and services, it's... This is an amazing dis,

194
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:47,943
I think. Of of capitalism a very pure capitalism.

195
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,051
Barks is cheer leading capitalism.

196
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:53,738
In this. Right? Oh, always.

197
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,955
Yes. Always, but, like,

198
00:19:56,794 --> 00:20:00,190
this one is just the the top of the mountain where he's like,

199
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:03,557
cheer from the top of the cheerleader pyramid.

200
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:04,715
Right. Right.

201
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:06,053
So

202
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:19,111
the page ends with Donald pondering again if if he only had a lot of money. And then we we transition to the part of the story that I think was really the most memorable.

203
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:22,721
This is really cool. Right? This is wildly,

204
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:31,245
like it it definitely... It falls apart if you think about it, So we've got a car logic it up here a little bit. But

205
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,601
we transition a Scrooge point of view where he is

206
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:40,408
an immense corn that he's got out in the back of the pastures.

207
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:47,127
And and so we kinda figure out the the reason for this unusual setting in this unusual scenario

208
00:20:47,544 --> 00:20:51,872
is it's it's another of his attempts to keep his money safe.

209
00:20:52,543 --> 00:21:02,069
I I love the look of the corn crib Sarah. It's it's immense. It's growing under the weight of all these, you know, all these got all these brace trying to keep it up. And he's just

210
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:16,525
looking and saying how you everyone thinks it's full of corn, so thieves have to bother to look inside. And Al he approaches it. He continues. If they knew I had three Huey, acres of money in there, they'd go moon.

211
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:29,794
And and really interestingly, he goes on to say, I wish people weren't so darned crazy about money. They make me nervous. Now me, I know that money isn't worth anything. It's just a lot of paper and metal.

212
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:31,715
And we get a classic

213
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:33,926
moment where he does...

214
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:40,930
Barks is gonna repeat the through line that he used in the most famous fruit story of all time.

215
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,200
It's what everyone knows about,

216
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:43,776
you know?

217
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:50,835
I love the stuff. I love to... Do you... Do you wanna give us read us his famous line Sarah?

218
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:59,390
So fruit is diving into the money and he says, but I love this stuff. I love to dive around in it like a corpus,

219
00:21:59,764 --> 00:22:04,264
and burrow through it like a go for and toss it up and let it hit me on the head,

220
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:05,465
which she's

221
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:08,605
doing it it seems to not hurt him.

222
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:10,520
Right. This is

223
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,700
big. It's a big part of the myth of Scrooge.

224
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:20,728
Right. This is this is what he loves to do. This is the hook that Barks used in only a plural man

225
00:22:21,146 --> 00:22:30,289
and he keeps it here. He doesn't always repeat these elements from stories. But but it's pretty I remember them... It's what I remember most

226
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:31,429
from duck.

227
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,809
Right. And one of the things that I found interesting

228
00:22:35,323 --> 00:22:42,677
was if at first I read though, I wish people weren't so darn crazy about money they make me nervous as projection.

229
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:44,846
As him accusing others

230
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:52,003
of the thing that he fully em himself and then it will get to it later, but He does

231
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:52,960
confirm.

232
00:22:53,298 --> 00:23:04,546
It's it's not greed that motivates him, which is what it feels like in every other Scrooge story. It's just that you know, if he loved to swim around in raspberries,

233
00:23:05,245 --> 00:23:07,463
he'd just accumulate a lot of raspberries

234
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:09,461
if he loved to

235
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:23,033
swim around In yard, he'd swim around in a bunch of yarn, like, it's... This one it's it makes very clear that he's not in it for the grade. He's in it for the sensory pleasure

236
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:23,910
of

237
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:26,719
jumping in and out of it like a purpose.

238
00:23:27,237 --> 00:23:36,435
Right. That is a big motivator of his. And and you know, Barks isn't known for his consistency. But but one of the things that he goes back to a few times.

239
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:45,954
And and that you you almost... He doesn't always say this directly, but he writes around the fact that for Scrooge dot, the

240
00:23:46,412 --> 00:24:20,700
the joy and his money and then what Huey, accumulated is that it's connected to the memories of how he acquired it. He has these memories that are attached to specific coins. Barks brings this up in, like, his kind of origin story. From uncle Scrooge number one. So that kinda makes to as canon as it can be. You know. And anyone always be consistent with that but it's usually a through line in these stories. And and it's how most fans read them that that yes, he's greedy. Yes. He loves money.

241
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:24,055
Specifically he loves his money

242
00:24:24,435 --> 00:25:04,159
because of of how he got it. So So the next sequence of the story is the Glad Gander sequence. Right? Got Gladstone is is Donald Lucky Cousin. You've gotten to see him a few times in these stories. I've noted before that Barb hates flat stuff. Right? It's like it's a it's a creation of his. That you can tell. He just he does not like him. He doesn't like his ethos and what he represents. And I think he's kind of meant to be like the the Devil Donald shoulder. Egg him on talking about how, yes, he hates where Gladstone never works. He doesn't have to.

243
00:25:04,538 --> 00:25:15,325
And kind of b about how he could have a million dollars if he just wished for it. He could hold out his hat. It would fill up with money. And so it

244
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:16,805
where Donald

245
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:22,876
abandoned his whole. I I like that. I like that panel where it says get away from me.

246
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:38,440
It's it's it's a funny little bit. Even without thinking about how people could could mis interpret that. But he he joins with Glad stone. You can tell that he's kinda open to his way of thinking and he's hoping that maybe Glad will wish for enough money

247
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,480
that neither of them have to experience

248
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,535
dr jury. And we transitioned to

249
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,095
maybe the most memorable

250
00:25:48,635 --> 00:25:54,026
segment of the story where the nephew see these black clouds gathering

251
00:25:54,523 --> 00:25:56,816
that form into a tornado.

252
00:25:57,153 --> 00:25:59,885
And, Sarah, do you wanna tell us about what happens

253
00:26:00,422 --> 00:26:06,615
with the tornado, what it does is, the cyclone. Excuse me. You recycling loan touches down

254
00:26:07,795 --> 00:26:08,295
specifically

255
00:26:08,995 --> 00:26:14,147
in the Money crib. Takes it up like a cow and not movie twister

256
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:32,573
and completely out it. Right. And and screws, we can get confirmed that he was safe because he's checking under the crib for leaks. And and this fascinating. Right? Sarah, you probably know enough about to know how out of character this is. Right? Normally, if something

257
00:26:32,949 --> 00:26:37,314
catastrophic happens to his money, he would be panicked and agitated

258
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:48,110
but he's very placid in this one and and when the nephews used to spare about how every bit of his money has been scattered all across the country,

259
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,550
he is just

260
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:56,310
calm and he says if I stay here and extends to my beans and pumpkins,

261
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,952
I'll get it all back, which is exactly how farming works. Right? Like, all farmers are.

262
00:27:04,443 --> 00:27:04,943
Right.

263
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,216
It it is

264
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:13,738
definitely not how farming works it's, but it is how things work in fable.

265
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:22,294
Right? Like, I am willing to give Barks a little bit of leeway here. Because of the way he is, like, very purposefully

266
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:25,607
structured the story as of

267
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:41,597
In that sentence, you know, he says he'll get it all back not feel earn it all that. Right. And and all of it. Right? We know that the... That's ridiculous. Right? How can you get every penny of it that? We know that this is gonna... This is gonna be operating by

268
00:27:42,255 --> 00:27:53,657
launch. Which Mh. A table, of course, is a story. It's a morality tail, and it's meant to teach less And in this case, the the lesson is about in industrial

269
00:27:54,754 --> 00:27:56,390
drift and hard work. Mh.

270
00:27:57,388 --> 00:27:58,726
So the the

271
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:11,065
The sequence of this story is pretty great. Right? We we transitioned to Gladstone and Donald loa and fishing together. And Donald manages to joel Gladstone into wishing for some money.

272
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:19,287
Glad says, he regards wishing even as a form of work. She's like, I'm just gonna... I'm not gonna strain myself.

273
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:31,702
And he says, oh, I wish a million dollars would drop in this hat I love Donald like, plaintiff to, like, hopeful look in these panels and then glad stones very alike une press look Al

274
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,116
indeed a huge sum of money

275
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,729
fills his hat

276
00:28:37,107 --> 00:28:38,726
dropping out of the sky.

277
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:48,995
We learned that it's two million dollars or they're about and Donald is is immediately chimes in one million for me and one for you and one for me.

278
00:28:50,649 --> 00:29:11,210
And he intends to get his kids and then travel the world with his windfall and and Gladstone thinks that sounds like fun and he'll join. But why don't you tell us what happens when he approaches the kids? The kids don't wanna go because they're worried about the pigs and chicken. That need their pin, which is true to farm life. I have

279
00:29:11,587 --> 00:29:14,241
some neighbors who just took their first

280
00:29:14,658 --> 00:29:18,645
overnight holiday in years and years in year and years and years.

281
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:26,205
So I know how hard it is for them to get away from their farm animals. Right. My parents have a farm in Arkansas.

282
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:33,093
With a couple dozen head of cattle, and it's such a thing to, like, coordinate

283
00:29:33,432 --> 00:29:47,907
leaving them behind. So, yeah. And so the nephews, they they go on to tell Donald that that money you got from the clouds belongs to, but Scrooge cuts them off. Right? Because Scrooge

284
00:29:48,306 --> 00:29:50,344
wants Donald and Gladstone,

285
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:51,782
to learn a lesson,

286
00:29:52,262 --> 00:30:05,068
wants the readers to learn the last and two. He's kind of... He's very omniscient in this one. Right? He knows how this is gonna play out. So he tells them to let Donald keep the money, he'll bring it Al back.

287
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:09,551
And and Donald and Gladstone

288
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:15,529
go off in his old be fire around about with its number three one three license plate to

289
00:30:15,946 --> 00:30:17,443
experience the world.

290
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,766
And then we drop in on other people in the area.

291
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:29,332
And around the world, apparently where where massive fortunes have been dropping into people's hands.

292
00:30:29,932 --> 00:30:30,850
And we get this, like,

293
00:30:31,585 --> 00:30:34,442
image of a farmer. Al couple of very stereotypical

294
00:30:34,861 --> 00:30:40,170
farmers saying to heck with work and we is going to see the world. Just

295
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,610
abandoning their pigs,

296
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,430
abandoning their Barks.

297
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,225
And and you know, Sarah, this is the moment where the story kind of really

298
00:30:49,685 --> 00:30:50,185
rings

299
00:30:50,685 --> 00:31:13,517
untrue to me. I mean, first off. It's a favor. It's very fantastic. Right. I'll allow that. But, like, I just mentioned, you know, my parents on their farm. I think back to my grand dad who used to run the farm. If you dropped a million dollars into his hat while he was on his farm one day, he would be very excited. He would not

300
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:23,582
leave his farm to go see the world. No. I feel like there are very, very, very many American suit, even with given a million dollars

301
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:24,634
would

302
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:47,050
consider leaving the country. Let me try up. Let me do the math point. Convert. I mean, we're pretty easy math around the early fifth. D's. It's roughly times ten or eleven, you know? But yeah, It's basically times. I found it. Calculate. Yeah. So, like a hundred bucks and nineteen fifty two is worth one thousand one hundred and some today. So it was

303
00:31:47,549 --> 00:32:18,096
before this, like, crazy bout of inflation right now. Times ten was a pretty good, you know, thing for most of the early Barks stories. Right now, it's about nine times Al less. Yeah. So, like, we're looking at times eleven, basically for any of the the stories from Barks Scrooge needs. And times is probably close enough. So Donald and Glad and everyone else, we assume each have about ten million bucks. I feel like with ten eleven million bucks any farmer is going to

304
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:20,580
upgrade their machinery or get things fixed

305
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:26,494
build new out buildings. Right? I told she's like They're just gonna abandon their farms.

306
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:33,405
Let alone is let alone Al we see coming up The whole world has abandoned their occupations.

307
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:46,230
Right. Like what this doesn't really take into a count is that there are all kinds of people. Right? You there's there's a lot of people where if you give them a million Barks or ten million bucks,

308
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:49,665
they're gonna go off the grid. They're gonna party...

309
00:32:50,485 --> 00:33:05,030
They're gonna vacation Al day. There's there are genuinely a lot of people who probably won't change their behavior that much. You know, maybe they'll like, live... Live life a little larger, but but a lot of people do what they like to do.

310
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:10,852
Already, and and they they would keep on doing. What we've learned from studies with

311
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,169
universal basic

312
00:33:12,587 --> 00:33:17,500
income is that people do work. Right? Like, as evidence

313
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,820
by the

314
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,493
that we have, right they have a time made a billion in quit Scrooge

315
00:33:23,852 --> 00:33:31,276
hasn't even made his billions and quit. Right? What what happens is just that people get more choo.

316
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:42,048
With what work they do and and and they don't have to take the first crappy job that is offered to them. And therefore, they find more fulfillment.

317
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:43,604
They are happier.

318
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:49,107
And then, you know, they have their, you know, over here. Right? We have our month long holidays.

319
00:33:50,297 --> 00:33:56,140
And then we come back and we go to work, not to say that everybody here is wealthy, but when you have

320
00:33:56,676 --> 00:33:59,904
enough or even more than in enough, that it's

321
00:34:00,243 --> 00:34:00,743
so

322
00:34:01,202 --> 00:34:03,740
silly. It breaks down under

323
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:12,496
the lightest touch of scrutiny to think that people are gonna stop working. Right. Yeah. And and that

324
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:17,242
exactly what you are talking about. This this does not really

325
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:24,816
this does not really accurately capture human behavior in the way that I think he thought it does.

326
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:28,738
Right? It's it's... He makes the rules in his favor.

327
00:34:29,177 --> 00:34:44,480
So... And and he's conducting this, he's conducting this cool little economic thought. Experiment. Right? And it is neat. It's neat to see it play out. It's very interesting to me. But I think you're right. Like, a lot of people

328
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:55,615
do the work that they do because they enjoy it. Or maybe they don't enjoy it, but the only thing they know how to do, some people if given this million bucks would do stuff that we don't

329
00:34:55,915 --> 00:34:56,415
necessarily

330
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:57,295
mentally

331
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,715
think of as work.

332
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:02,519
Society doesn't count as work, but it is still work. You know?

333
00:35:03,516 --> 00:35:07,565
Volunteering is is a form of work taking care of your

334
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:08,442
family

335
00:35:08,994 --> 00:35:28,041
is a form of work, and and that's where this this kind of breaks down to me because it it doesn't really catch sure behavior the way that I think he thinks it does. Mark, what would you do is ten eleven million dollars just fell in your lap? Yeah. That's that's the question. Right?

336
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:36,955
That's the big thought experiment. I mean, I'd I'd pay off my debts. I would I would take a month and go see the world.

337
00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:53,918
Just like Donald and Glad, I would go and see the world because I do love doing that, but then I would come back and basically figure out what what do I really want to do with the rest of my life? Now that I have financial security and I would probably

338
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:57,509
try and do kind of a mix of hobbies

339
00:35:58,126 --> 00:35:58,626
and

340
00:35:59,603 --> 00:36:05,065
enroll in some universe any classes to learn the things that I wanna learn, I would probably

341
00:36:05,683 --> 00:36:06,821
take up writing

342
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:08,816
because I like writing

343
00:36:10,366 --> 00:36:16,691
So, like, I wouldn't abandon work. But it... I I would abandon dr.

344
00:36:17,164 --> 00:36:29,418
Work. Mh. Would I would I quit my day job? Right? I'm a I'm a speech therapist. I probably wouldn't quit my day job. But I would probably do it through regularly,

345
00:36:30,392 --> 00:36:31,729
you know, and and and

346
00:36:32,225 --> 00:36:33,203
fewer hours.

347
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:42,935
How about? You know, for me... Yeah. I would I would go I would go see the world. I would... And then you know what? I would come up and I would hire

348
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:51,844
so many people to work on my house And then I would hire so many more people to build me my dream house. Like, my

349
00:36:52,263 --> 00:36:52,763
financial

350
00:36:53,222 --> 00:36:53,722
fantasies

351
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:56,818
involve travel and house building.

352
00:36:57,457 --> 00:36:59,815
Yeah. So maybe I abandoned work.

353
00:37:01,348 --> 00:37:10,755
Right. But but we would both do some travel. That... That's where this does ring true. Right? Right. But like, are we just gonna drop Severino.

354
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:16,515
Are we gonna drop our hose in the middle of our... Tending to our proverbial cabbage?

355
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,210
Our pro proverbial cucumbers.

356
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:28,499
Probably not. But... Yeah. Alright. So let's let see where this takes them. Because this is the big morality part of this story. Right?

357
00:37:29,937 --> 00:37:31,895
So Donald Gladstone,

358
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,570
make it to a town

359
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:41,130
intending to to ref refuel and get a fancy diner. But they find that every business

360
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:41,930
they

361
00:37:42,284 --> 00:37:48,047
stop that has is boarded up has a closed owner gone to see the world. So.

362
00:37:49,382 --> 00:37:50,560
And and they're basically

363
00:37:51,057 --> 00:37:52,450
stuck in this town

364
00:37:52,830 --> 00:38:02,145
because we we see that everyone has decided to do as they are doing very economically, we see these, like well dressed people I

365
00:38:02,445 --> 00:38:06,025
playing with bags of money. Right? It's it's really hammering

366
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:09,225
to us that this money is worthless

367
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,960
if there are if there isn't anything

368
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:25,885
spend on. And that's that's an idea that rings true. For me, right? This is the this is the first... The idea of the perceived value of money. What is money money is paper and metal

369
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:30,535
that society of agrees has value Well, and it's a warning against

370
00:38:30,953 --> 00:38:33,691
inflation. Right? Like, we've seen countries

371
00:38:34,404 --> 00:38:35,542
have such

372
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,327
inflation so high that they're literally carrying around stacks of bills and wheel arrows

373
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,940
and it's all they can afford to buy,

374
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:55,896
you know, a day's worth of food with. Right. And and in this case, inflation is is gonna be essentially Scrooge le or or tool to together the whole

375
00:38:57,446 --> 00:39:00,660
So so Donald and Glad stone are reduced

376
00:39:01,357 --> 00:39:04,984
to... Oh, we we get this like, little towns towns,

377
00:39:05,483 --> 00:39:18,530
who says nobody raises sheep for wool. Nobody. He makes the wall in cloth. Nobody it does a really good job of hammering home Barks point. Here. Right? That that that's that this stuff comes from labor.

378
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,470
And that that is definitely

379
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:25,416
true. Right? Like we don't get these nice things.

380
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:29,666
We don't get the things that sustain us without people

381
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:40,992
being willing to work for them. I think I think where you and I would probably differ from Barks is is the argument that he should be well eight for them. And and maybe they should

382
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:41,911
reasonably

383
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,285
expect to be able to also go see the world from time to time.

384
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,917
Or do what they like to do. So

385
00:39:50,494 --> 00:39:53,870
so Donald Gladstone are walking through the reins, soaking

386
00:39:54,824 --> 00:40:03,144
saying everybody has a million dollars, nobody has to work, which, of course, is a lie. Right? In the story. It's it's it's an... It's an irony.

387
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,158
These things. Mh.

388
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:13,100
And then we get this... We we jump back Scrooge and the nephews on the farm where toy goes on. Apparently, they are the only one.

389
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:22,975
Left where and Scrooge is caution the Nephews to guard these cabbage Louie won't be long till they're the only cabbage left.

390
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:25,405
And likewise he he

391
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:36,877
cha sizes dewey to guard the eggs, it won't be long to they're the only eggs slash. And it's the same line repeated for emphasis. Right. It gives the weapons.

392
00:40:37,776 --> 00:40:38,095
Mh.

393
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:39,727
Which is

394
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:40,724
scary.

395
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:47,222
Yeah. It... It's definitely a little bit disarming to see children being given weapons.

396
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:52,794
Guns. And compared to being prepared to fight for resources.

397
00:40:53,374 --> 00:40:58,224
Yeah. One of them is an old blonde bus kind of a economically old looking gun. Yeah.

398
00:40:58,982 --> 00:41:08,515
But then the other is just an outright shotgun on But, you know, at the same time, this is also not odd even today on, like a farm. Right. Guns

399
00:41:08,892 --> 00:41:10,070
guns are necessary

400
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:11,245
on Barks.

401
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:15,509
Pardon they? It it is hard to be a farmer. Whose

402
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:16,348
live

403
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:19,265
is subject to calling by coyote

404
00:41:19,764 --> 00:41:23,340
and not have at least a shotgun done

405
00:41:23,654 --> 00:41:30,007
to to scare them off. You know? Okay. So the danger is wildlife. It's not other people.

406
00:41:30,687 --> 00:41:32,585
Right. Right. Yeah. Really

407
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:38,826
Yeah. Yeah. The average farmer is gonna have is gonna have some guns basically

408
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:45,286
for for that reason for boxes and coyote and and so... And that's not unusual.

409
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:47,263
So they they eventually

410
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,417
one day, donald and glad

411
00:41:51,209 --> 00:42:02,505
stagger or Barks. They're looking way worse for aware with patched up clothes. They still have their bags of money because they're not worth anything right now. And he plead

412
00:42:03,005 --> 00:42:25,125
to sc for his job back and Scrooge. What his screwed tell him? Sure. You can have your job back. But if you want breakfast to eggs a million dollars a apiece. And and so other people find their are way to beg jobs and buys meal, buy meals, and the narrator box tells us, does uncle Scrooge charge them? Yeah.

413
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:32,513
And we see this like menu board with prices. You wanna tell us some of the prices sarah. Cams are

414
00:42:32,852 --> 00:42:34,311
one billion dollars

415
00:42:35,184 --> 00:42:37,360
Cabbage are two million dollars.

416
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:48,534
Of corn, three million dollars plus to pack. How much is it pack? Oh, I don't remember. That's what Peter piper picked a pack of. Right? Right So much of packed.

417
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:52,285
A pack is eight dry court

418
00:42:53,105 --> 00:42:54,605
about eight point leaders.

419
00:42:55,065 --> 00:43:05,314
Sure they're so easy. Yeah. Yeah. And then an ounce of wool, which doesn't make you much of a sweater does it? Not even of the stock is four million dollars.

420
00:43:05,953 --> 00:43:32,024
Right. So so we get the point hammered home, here. Right? That he he's the only producer. He's the only productive one around. So he's gonna have the market cornered on this. And and, you know, the, the fabulous part of this is the wrap up. Right? Eventually Uncle Scrooge gets all of his money back and things are again as they were. And we assume... Have the inflation went.

421
00:43:32,464 --> 00:43:34,784
I know. Right? That that what happens.

422
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:36,159
Yeah.

423
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:42,039
And and, you know, we get this interaction between Donald and Scrooge.

424
00:43:43,213 --> 00:43:46,649
You wanna read what Donald says, and I'll read what sp says?

425
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:51,897
You claim that money is worthless. Yet you've corner that whole mountain of it How come?

426
00:43:52,256 --> 00:43:59,400
Scrooge sp says, you wouldn't understand Nephew. I love money. I love to dive around in Al like a purpose.

427
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:01,948
And burrow through it like a go

428
00:44:02,445 --> 00:44:09,459
and toss it up and let it hit me on the head. And then Donald back in the fields with his hoe, says

429
00:44:09,798 --> 00:44:10,298
disgusting.

430
00:44:11,796 --> 00:44:18,210
It's it's it's a very pack wrap up. It's a great wrap up. It's come full circle

431
00:44:18,684 --> 00:44:25,455
So Sarah, I think I I love this story. Right? I think it's very successful.

432
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:26,629
I think it's

433
00:44:27,087 --> 00:44:37,578
incredibly well written. It it stands out to me. I have some some deep problems with sort sort of the like under underpinning, the philosophical

434
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:46,758
underpinning of the school. Right. I think it I collapse a little bit under the weight like that corn crib should have collapsed. But

435
00:44:47,095 --> 00:44:49,723
I do find this very satisfying,

436
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:51,521
engaging

437
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:52,520
story

438
00:44:52,979 --> 00:44:57,249
despite all of that. Well, what about you as as a Barks

439
00:44:57,669 --> 00:44:58,169
newbie,

440
00:44:59,187 --> 00:45:03,242
someone who's not invested in the idea of Scrooge is the protagonist and

441
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:08,009
I didn't hate it. As much as some of the other ones that don't

442
00:45:08,946 --> 00:45:12,440
withstand the test of time are that bring up values

443
00:45:12,778 --> 00:45:17,062
that are not my own I think as a story,

444
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,319
it is

445
00:45:18,896 --> 00:45:19,396
crafted

446
00:45:19,734 --> 00:45:32,176
very well. It's just that the the more is a little bit. Not my fake. Mh. Yeah. I mean, it it is... Let's let's be fair. It's a morality tail. So if the model

447
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:39,829
if the moral doesn't work for you, then then the story is not gonna be that successful. Can I read to you

448
00:45:40,169 --> 00:45:40,669
a

449
00:45:42,223 --> 00:45:44,200
a fun quote of his?

450
00:45:46,094 --> 00:45:51,319
Oh, okay. Here's here's the quote I like of his from one of his changes

451
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:59,751
with a fan, I believe in Al letter. He said I was in Atlanta for a big comic book seminar in June and a week weekend at Disneyland for

452
00:46:00,684 --> 00:46:05,904
Convention in September. I was treated like a Vip, but felt more like a piece of merchandise.

453
00:46:06,604 --> 00:46:19,119
Oh, well, it's good for business, and it helps make jobs for many, many people. So that... That kind of like gives you a little bit of of kind of his attitude. I think that job create

454
00:46:19,433 --> 00:46:20,292
that wealth

455
00:46:20,668 --> 00:46:21,168
creation

456
00:46:21,624 --> 00:46:29,492
in and of itself is a good thing. That's where I think he lines up with Scrooge that like Wealth gets wealth.

457
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:34,221
Alright. Listeners. At this point, we're gonna end the up. So just a little bit abruptly

458
00:46:34,814 --> 00:46:41,342
I decided midway that since we're talking about two pretty significant ten page stories

459
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,058
that are them automatically

460
00:46:43,516 --> 00:46:48,070
very related, this is going to be a two part episode. So

461
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:52,470
just join us next week for the conclusion

462
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:53,645
of this

463
00:46:54,264 --> 00:46:57,320
episode that again, we're calling Scrooge genomics.
