So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks.

2
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:02,082
Welcome back everyone to Barks remarks. I have here a returning guest host. I'm gonna ask him to introduce himself and also tell us The worst thing he's ever done in pursuit of rare butterfly.

3
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:13,900
Hello. My name is Eric Curt. I'll me back. And the worst thing I had is the done in the pursuit of we're butterfly, I would have to say is probably through some rocks Scrooge. We're trying to do

4
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,800
biology project in high school.

5
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:30,540
Where we had the cats do bug collection. I don't know if it was rare. I'm sure it chase butterflies. And when that failed i through some rocks they create because splash are fine. There you go. I didn't I didn't think you'd have an actual response to that. So awesome.

6
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,820
So yes, as alluded to,

7
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:38,168
regarding the butterfly, we are going to be talking today about darkest

8
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:39,047
Africa

9
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:41,500
of fairly unusual

10
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,179
Donald Ducktales adventure.

11
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,895
You know, it kinda reminds me of the, like, what would you do for a Ducktales bar. Right? These these Ducktales

12
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:50,315
and

13
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:55,295
and professor Mc are are gonna end up doing a lot and pursue this butterfly.

14
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:57,890
Yes. I have to say for

15
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,930
a very

16
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,810
poor

17
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,385
Ducktales. Donald gets around the world a lot. Yeah. Yeah. It helps when you're bank by

18
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:07,305
random

19
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:08,385
wealthy

20
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:11,145
butterfly collectors slash ben.

21
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:12,399
Yes.

22
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,873
Alright. So, yeah, Eric,

23
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:19,662
let's get into it. Again, we are talking about darkest Africa

24
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:21,751
And usually,

25
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:25,382
I mentioned when the story was published.

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,990
This is another of those kind of ne ones that was originally published in one of the weird

27
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,430
giveaway comics

28
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:51,025
called March of Comics or boys and girls, March of comics, to go into the full title. It was one of those that where they could publish it to be given away in, like, shoe stores or or wherever, and they would put the store's name would go on the comic. Right? So so they don't have...

29
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,972
I don't have the actual date for it. We just know that this was published

30
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:56,863
near the beginning of nineteen

31
00:02:57,242 --> 00:03:01,299
forty eight, and it was March of comics number twenty. And

32
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:10,777
Eric since the last time I had you on. I've started to mention how many printing are listed in total in English for this one. And

33
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,972
you know, we were last on for

34
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:16,265
Christmas on Bear Mountain and because that was,

35
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:28,712
you know, such an important one, that's had a a lot of printing. This one's pretty occasionally printed. Right? Including the original run. There only five printing total. Okay. And and

36
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:32,403
can can you guess why this one probably

37
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:36,578
was fewer than many. Just gonna guess the demand wasn't there.

38
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:37,957
Possibly

39
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:39,135
some of the art.

40
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:45,665
Yes well, yeah. There's there's a few... There's a few issues with this one that

41
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,790
have you know, stoked a little bit of controversy. It's it's a little bit of a darker.

42
00:03:51,329 --> 00:04:02,938
I would almost say a little bit cruel comic. Right? I I don't find character very likable in this one. But anyway, we'll we'll get into that. Let's see. This is a twenty two pager.

43
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:03,935
And

44
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:05,331
there is

45
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:13,425
some good background to go into for this one. But before we do that, Eric, would you like to offer us up your

46
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:16,991
synopsis for this story. Sure. It says

47
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:23,292
where Al and Duck help his net chase butterflies and runs into a

48
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:29,288
another collective butterflies and becomes becomes rival and then gets rope into

49
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:34,447
going to africa to catch the rarest of rare butterflies. Against this

50
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:35,404
sc

51
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:51,720
rival collector who sabotage them, they said touch him, Hygiene and sue, they catch the bug butterfly. And the wins. Yeah. That's right. And and I would say no one no one comes out of this one looking particular really good in my opinion.

52
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,680
No. So

53
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,660
I already mentioned that this is a March of comic story. This is our second march of comics.

54
00:04:59,353 --> 00:05:03,167
Giveaway story. Mah Donald was the first one. And

55
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:14,530
this story also has the distinction of being one of the times that Carl Barks is gonna go back and copy himself. Because he's gonna basically

56
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,985
reuse this plot you know, later donald dot com called called forbidden Valley. And

57
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:27,274
I like... I like that version, I think a bit better than this one. They're very similar, but

58
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:39,129
the big stampede at the end we get is a bunch of dinosaurs. So that's pretty cool. That's pretty good. Yeah. Although the elephant stampede pete in this is is definitely impressive. Yeah. This one

59
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:42,240
was subject to a lot of post

60
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:43,316
publications

61
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:44,169
censorship,

62
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:50,520
which is is pretty understandable because this one does traffic in some pretty unfortunate

63
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:51,494
stereotypes,

64
00:05:52,150 --> 00:06:02,960
which Eric, you you really didn't get to see too much of. I think you probably saw some of it because it it was really in the stories Dna, and it couldn't...

65
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,280
It couldn't be completely covered up, but they did

66
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:14,208
do some like, Disney censorship, you know, after the fact where they went back and kinda soften some of the racial

67
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:15,087
car

68
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:16,525
and

69
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:25,321
some of the the terms that were pretty questionable You know, the time frame as to when that happened? I think that it was

70
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:42,485
immediately after like, when as soon as they went back to reprint it, and I don't know exactly how many years. But I'm guessing was probably within the first decade or so. Okay. That's pretty good recognizing and changing it as soon as they can. So while still publishing something that's

71
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,160
questionable

72
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:49,460
for recognizing that I give... And that's that's something of. So when it get around for a few issues.

73
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:51,388
Right.

74
00:06:52,006 --> 00:07:03,105
And then, you know, as often happens, they probably will adjust it over the years and keep fine tuning it until I'm guessing this one's probably not gonna see a lot of reprint

75
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:09,840
anymore outside of, like, the the collections that they do. But it but it is worth noting right, that these attitudes

76
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:17,895
even though we're not gonna justify them they were totally in keeping with the time. Right? I don't know if you've read any other

77
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:25,338
comics from this era. I was actually exposed to one just not to... Recently, I got from a library called

78
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:27,013
involving a

79
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,482
superhero comic called the green turtle about a chinese.

80
00:07:31,313 --> 00:07:31,813
American

81
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:32,731
superhero

82
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:35,524
that I found very interesting and was very

83
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,466
kind of been compelling. So I thought that was Al interesting contrast to what reading this one as well.

84
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:55,130
And did that one... I mean, I'm I'm sure it had problems. Was it Oh, oh. Absolutely. What it what I read was it was a a new walker, a new asian American macarthur who had written and he brought it,

85
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,090
the the shadow zero, and so he created this backstory

86
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:09,179
to this Asian American hero that's featured in the in the forties and wrote about the Chinese American who had created the zero, but at the time could not

87
00:08:09,518 --> 00:08:21,811
portray him as a chinese hero And so this hero, you never saw his face in the comic. It was always his back or you always saw it was always hiding in face because couldn't show that he was in Chinese American

88
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,305
fighting, Japanese

89
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:36,943
enrolled in China world or two of the japanese were just horribly stereotype your tight. Know that Al as they were back then. So many were back then. Yeah. Having read that and now reading this one. Yeah. It's it's been an interesting

90
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,220
week and and a half for me reading those. Al all that. Yeah. To me the ones that come to mind,

91
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,610
you know, the ones that I'm most familiar with are, like the Asterisk

92
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:48,779
stories. And

93
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:59,182
ten ten or ten ten and those have kind of the same... Those are like almost the exact same era and are incredibly famous, well comics have some of these same stereotypes.

94
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,276
Again, we're not ex it, but we're like,

95
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:06,407
understanding. This wasn't unique to Carl Barks. This really was

96
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:14,171
just kind of the way you depicted savages at the time. So... And and we'll we'll see a little bit of growth from him

97
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:24,369
moving forward we'll also see some other problematic stories, but, you know, as always, I don't wanna be labor it too much, but, you know, we do have to recognize it no. I'll share

98
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:27,726
on the Facebook page, some of the panels

99
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:38,798
that we can look at to compare some of the changes that they've made. You know, some other interesting background for this one, I think is apart from, like, the racial stereotypes.

100
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:47,983
This one, it's almost like he went out of his way to make it awkward to reprint it because it has some like, some pretty brutal treatment of animals

101
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,253
in this one and and then that old, like saw of the the old trope of the comedic attempted

102
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:03,024
suicide at the end. Right? So there's there's some content here. And just times have changed. Yes. Yes. They.

103
00:10:03,782 --> 00:10:08,313
And and before we talk a little bit more about the historical backgrounds,

104
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:14,558
one of our newer features is trying to wrap our mouths around some of the titles

105
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:15,397
from

106
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:21,880
publication from around the world. So we've got we've got four of them today. Eric, I think you're gonna do

107
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:27,925
Spain and Italy. Right, which leaves me France in Germany. Alright. So

108
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:30,525
in French, the title is

109
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:31,365
Lars

110
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,019
o c, x stan,

111
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:40,712
which I'm thinking must be the chase of the almost as extinct quest or quasi extinct

112
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:46,525
I I'm going out on Limb. I didn't even look that one up. Go for go for Spain. In Spain

113
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:47,945
in at,

114
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:49,765
the Africa.

115
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,300
The heart of Africa.

116
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,140
Right.

117
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,740
And in Germany, we've got

118
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,300
d le

119
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,220
mori

120
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:07,705
and that's the last more bun. I think we're we're thinking that more must be the name of the almost six distinct in germany. And then go for Italy.

121
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,446
Sum Chase of the

122
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:15,281
pre purchased sixteen

123
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:21,215
which is part the name of the butterfly. Right. I think it's just Donald and the extinct. Oh, it's how

124
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:42,645
Patrick. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. That makes more sense. Like, the should be and. Right. I think it's just Donald and the extinct Cl. Yeah. So none of those titles really match English one, which is pretty interesting. Eric, do you know kind of switching to the historical context here? Do you know anything about the term Darkest Africa?

125
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:52,132
Only what I've seen in media where they would often call to remember this what's his name that famous

126
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:52,984
hunter

127
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:56,261
excuse me. He was played by Sean Conner in the movie

128
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,819
league of.

129
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:12,055
Oh, Al Quadrant, Is allen in quarter. Yes. They prefer going after Al the dark consonants. Yeah. Yeah. That's the other term. Right? It start this Africa where the dark content. Yeah. So I actually

130
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:17,295
just happened to learn about this a couple months ago in a podcast

131
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:21,710
about atrocities in the Belgian congo. It was

132
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:23,585
What's his name Ward

133
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:25,858
not Lord. It was Stanley.

134
00:12:26,235 --> 00:12:27,971
Henry Stanley, you know, famous

135
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:31,201
Explorer, the guy who said

136
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:33,291
supposedly said doctor Livingston

137
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,480
he he popularized that term in his

138
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:43,673
in one of his books. And you know, it... It's just what you think it's meant to, like, refer to Africa's

139
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:51,104
a very savage and mysterious place. So that's that's where we get that title. It's not really...

140
00:12:51,522 --> 00:13:04,993
Yeah. Certainly, it's certainly not not a good term. To use for Africa these days. I I also found interesting that this story has a lot of examples of what what I learned is called dog Latin. Right? So there's pig latin.

141
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:08,269
Sure and there's dog Latin. And Dog Latin,

142
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:11,240
Dog Latin is when you take

143
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,560
a word and you like fake latin. Right? So the almost

144
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,280
extinct is just the almost

145
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:21,835
that actually... There's there's a there's a term for that practice.

146
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:24,415
Okay. Yeah. So I like...

147
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:26,547
I like learning that. And then

148
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:28,940
just out of curiosity, I googled.

149
00:13:29,556 --> 00:13:41,277
I think I Googled like, Cut throat and butterfly collector or or butterfly collector and murder just to see if anything came up. And it came up with an Npr story from about

150
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:51,297
thirteen years ago about a dude I mean, the story was more about the fish and wildlife guy, But who he went undercover to trap an international

151
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:52,470
butterfly thief.

152
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:58,625
From japan. Yes. And the guy touted himself as the world's most wanted

153
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:03,956
butterfly smuggle. So. They can't leave his large competition, but should go for it. Yeah. Absolutely.

154
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:07,352
That sounds so we has a Barks side cartoon. Yep.

155
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:13,912
Let's see. I I kinda skipped over the value range for this one. For whatever reason I had trouble finding

156
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:21,862
the, like, top top value, but I found that there was an eight point o that sold for twenty one hundred dollars. So,

157
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,884
you know, expensive, but maybe not Al a range for some people. And

158
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,251
let's see notable appearances. We we have professor Mc.

159
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:48,722
I don't even remember the name of the the random ben manufacturer. I don't know if he's even named, but But no one in this one is ever going to really appear again. And then I like to talk about which version of the characters we get in here. And I would say this is a good example of our our very stubborn

160
00:14:49,099 --> 00:15:00,000
version of Donald. He's also very resourceful on this one now. And, you know, he's he's not quite a villain in this one, but he's definitely like, willing to kind of meet

161
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:16,583
professor Mc at his level I guess you could say. So and I I just I would get up and there's ben is sir that monthly. Oh, yes. Thank you. Because he does have a great Barks cnn name. Yes. Awesome son. Alright. I think

162
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:23,326
we are ready to dive into the story itself. Eric, you let me know if you have any reflections

163
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:24,219
after

164
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:28,330
talking about some of these pages. Sure time. Alright. So

165
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:33,315
darkest Africa you mentioned opens with the Ducktales

166
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:33,975
catching

167
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:43,540
butterflies, Donald is helping the nephews out with Al class project of theirs. And, you know, they're all they're all really into it. They seem to be having

168
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:45,313
some good clean fun.

169
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:55,322
I'm not sure about the fact that they're just kind of like tossing a bunch of butterflies loose into a big jumble in a cigar box, but, you know, it's a school project.

170
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,288
Donald seems pretty knowledgeable too about butterflies. Right? He

171
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:06,220
identifies the f fa from the tropics at the very beginning. And by the end of the page,

172
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:11,010
he is pursuing a new kind of butterfly that they've never seen

173
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:18,060
and he his net crosses with another net from an unidentified collector simultaneously.

174
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:37,640
That's gonna be interesting that these boys just have randomly i put place in the park and the funny clear ones and they just have across some... Like, there's some kind of butterfly magnet in this part, that which Al these heard better butterflies so those other collectors there. Yeah. Funny so. Popcorn. It's Duck berg butterfly district.

175
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,000
Here go. Alright. So

176
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,455
Donald and this this new collector get an argument

177
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:49,695
over this butterfly and the collector indicates that it's a very rare Pip

178
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:54,950
from Brazil and, you know, he's very determined to have him first his collection.

179
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,670
So they get in in a sc

180
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:02,680
And Donald kinda gets we see him get a bright idea. He

181
00:17:03,218 --> 00:17:05,675
removes his nets suddenly and

182
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:22,146
smash is the net over the head of the other collector grabs the collector's net and is able to scoop up the butterfly himself. And in the background, we see a very well dressed gentleman kind of taking in this seam. This is interesting because very rarely

183
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:26,238
Donald being more than somebody else. He normally...

184
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:29,032
Mean, he he did go to anger, but he actually

185
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,525
outside the guy to get ahead of him get you money, which

186
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:52,940
looking at and now nice you get a little bit of foreshadowing of what's gonna happen later on in the story, at least you guys going at it. Yeah. That's true. It's it's necessary in this story, I think for Donald to be more strategic than he usually would be. Yeah Alright. So on the next page, you know, donald is triumphant, the other collector

187
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,338
is fuming

188
00:17:54,677 --> 00:17:55,657
and the

189
00:17:56,036 --> 00:18:12,799
well dressed gentleman approaches him. And I like, I like his line. He just says young man, I like the way you did that dirty trick. You know, no one is no one is being shy about how under handed they're being. And this guy introduces is... As you said, he's got a great Barks name Sir

190
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:23,617
Mo, the famous butterfly collector. He wants to recruit Donald to help him complete his collect And specifically, he'd like to have him go to Africa

191
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:28,607
to bring back the butterfly that we're gonna know so much about by the end of the almost

192
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:29,979
six stink.

193
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:31,335
Donald,

194
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:45,385
upon learning that it's in Africa blanche, because that's very far away. And he's like, why why would you need me? And he indicates that, you know, Donald has just bamboo b one of the most cut throat butterfly collectors there is.

195
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:53,918
Professor argus Mc fe. And so, you know, he's probably gonna have another run with him if he chooses to go to Africa.

196
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:56,010
I like that he's a butterfly collector.

197
00:18:56,504 --> 00:19:00,054
But he has no net, like, he just came towards their butterflies.

198
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:03,506
Yes. Yeah. That's true. He he came to

199
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:11,000
scout for another butterfly collector to do his dirty work, I guess. But, you know, that's what you find in the butterfly district. Absolutely.

200
00:19:11,554 --> 00:19:13,730
So on the next page the f user

201
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:17,121
are kinda saying now, it would be pretty neat to go to Africa.

202
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:25,610
You know, Donald is right right fully talking about what a pain in the butt it would be all the things that he'd need to arrange while he's gone. And,

203
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,770
you know, they kinda give it up the nephews

204
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:50,988
say that they might as well take the butterflies to their teacher, and they walk past professor Mc hiding behind a tree and he just snatch the whole collection and catches the taxi and runs off. I've gotta to say I like the the the evil sn that is plastered across Mc mackenzie face in, like, ninety percent of his appearance.

205
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:52,207
Yeah. Absolutely.

206
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:57,136
But I mean, how evil can you be when you stealing butterflies with kids?

207
00:19:57,475 --> 00:20:04,378
I mean, it's just that's his name. What Al load levels of hell right there. Yeah. That's almost grinch. Right? Yeah absolutely.

208
00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:06,811
So

209
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:13,220
Donald learns from a random farmer who heard him take the taxi that he's on his way to Africa.

210
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,275
So that's that's all it takes. Donald is driven by his need to get

211
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:19,275
revenge.

212
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:24,995
He's gonna take that job and just midway through this page we transition

213
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:26,370
to Africa.

214
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:31,930
It's right. No transition per store for traveling, no adventures there, no t monsters,

215
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,581
or pirates just right africa?

216
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:35,856
Right. And,

217
00:20:36,273 --> 00:20:37,888
you know, we even transition

218
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:40,850
immediately to the butterfly, which

219
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,130
has a helpful arrow

220
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,105
pointing to where it is. It's a really a lovely scene of, like

221
00:20:48,643 --> 00:21:00,841
lagoon with a lot of cool wild but really, really great panel. So nice depth to it too. We see a native an African native who spotted it and it starts kind of a

222
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,117
a drumming

223
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:04,570
transmission of of the message.

224
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:13,495
And go ahead and comment whatever you'd like, Eric. I'm gonna take a moment to share the original panels here with you for some of these.

225
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:16,123
Well, I just looking at that

226
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:20,308
native and just... Yeah. That's really request.

227
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:21,961
And if that's been changed,

228
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:36,753
Yeah. Those are those are red drives. Right? So We're we're looking out at the original art. And and like to be fair, these these depictions are again totally within the standard of of the time. They have the kind of like,

229
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:38,292
oversized

230
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,185
lips. That we're we're drawn for many black characters.

231
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:58,931
But it it's gonna get a little bit worse for some of these. Yeah. That's that's this that the disturbing to say. Gladstone redid did them. Yeah. I I agree. It was it was the right call. You know, in the panel that we see, there is some

232
00:21:59,308 --> 00:22:04,593
sort of pigeon talk to communicate the transmission but in the original

233
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,430
panel,

234
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:15,772
you know, I don't have that part. I actually don't know if they just retained that or not. I I am glad to see that they at least like... Oh, it's not pigeon. I'm glad that

235
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:25,058
you know, making a made up language is, I guess, arguably, not as offensive as using, like a pigeon speak that you sometimes see. Yeah.

236
00:22:25,696 --> 00:22:26,570
That's there.

237
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,650
So on the next page, we see the rest of this transmission

238
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,530
and

239
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,730
donald,

240
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:41,738
you know, it gets back to Donald who's you know, at a camp. And in this panel that we see, he asks know you the voice of the drums, Moo

241
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:56,502
is the name of the native that he's talking too. And then in the original one, he's actually referred to as fuzzy Wu, which which is both offensive and and confusing to me. So... Yeah. But the the native says that the

242
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,617
butterfly has been spotted on the upper w Busy river.

243
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:09,582
And B is the... You hear that a lot in, you know, this kind of media. That apparently is sw Huey, for for, like, master

244
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:20,178
loss. Okay. And so the the du break for their camp and they launch a boat to be on their way. And as they as they lead their boat off,

245
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:21,656
it's clear that

246
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:23,973
holes have been drilled in their boat

247
00:23:24,312 --> 00:23:24,812
and

248
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:26,025
about sinks

249
00:23:26,484 --> 00:23:31,099
and they see a note floating on the water that says, welcome to Africa,

250
00:23:31,518 --> 00:23:32,338
professor Mc.

251
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:37,786
Yes. Did you wanna mention what you had found about

252
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:52,778
Lamb be z? Yes. I did some research on the Web Busy just thinking i don't think it's real, but let's look it up and what I misspelled it because in this one, it's spelled w h a m. When I was going after by memory I still did w m and it popped as a reference

253
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:56,648
to the old serial comic... The phantom, which

254
00:23:57,026 --> 00:24:01,534
involved heavily of the advent in the Ducktales. If you know anything about the phantom.

255
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:11,496
From what I could find, the reference was some created in the eighties. So I don't know if writers were pulling from other stuff or older stuff because the phantom has been around

256
00:24:11,954 --> 00:24:45,677
forever, and they had been lost the continuity excuse with the van. Was in Southeast asia was in Africa. But doing... Don't know it's coincidence. Don't know if it's i mind or if it's something maybe Barks heard when Huey, was when, you know, you mentioned in the original phantom of comments back back the day. But I just thought it was very interesting to have that very similar name in a similar site type of adventure comic that is the phantom. That's all about the the daring dew and the rescuing and fighting of pirates and evil treasure collected collectors I don't know Can... I fan everyone after butter butterfly collectors

257
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:53,325
who knows. I I think that's a good catch. I would I wouldn't be surprised, You know, the the phantom was a super famous

258
00:24:53,985 --> 00:24:54,485
serial

259
00:24:54,865 --> 00:25:06,328
strip. Right? And so I I would be shocked if Barks wasn't familiar with it. So I think that's a cool catch. So on the x page, the du power are patching up their boat, they agree that Mc

260
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:07,566
has one

261
00:25:08,104 --> 00:25:11,295
round one of their sperm here. And

262
00:25:11,915 --> 00:25:18,895
they managed to get the boat going again. Eventually, Donald is really thirsty, so he takes a big drink from his canteen.

263
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:33,606
And finds out that it has mud in it. The water has been doctor. And so they decide they need to check out their rations. So Tunnel throws a piece of hard attack to one of the crocodile dials that's near the boat. Eric do you wanna tell us

264
00:25:34,062 --> 00:25:35,638
what happens to that crocodile

265
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:36,650
Oh

266
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:41,165
look rapport to say crocodile just wanted have a snack and then he ended dying.

267
00:25:42,023 --> 00:25:45,415
Yeah. He open dies pretty thoroughly. So

268
00:25:46,073 --> 00:25:48,926
butterfly collecting is serious business

269
00:25:49,344 --> 00:26:01,970
cut throat. So i and, you know, I like that that pan. I don't... It's a little bit off putting the fact that, you know, they're just killing crocodile in this episode in this comic, but I like the

270
00:26:02,284 --> 00:26:07,643
crocodile, death throws in those two panels. That spreads it's pretty funny and pretty neat art.

271
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,389
So the Ducktales

272
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:15,073
journey down the river, they, you know, figure they have to live off the land. They get their water by mocking

273
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:24,218
a monkey and getting it to throw coconut that's at them. A nice lever touch. Yeah. And we transition to nightfall. There's really awesome

274
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:30,968
couple of silhouette panels of the ducks in their boat. One of these was adapted into the the cover

275
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:48,516
for the the issue, the reprint that I first read this one in which I think it's just a... Yeah. Really cool cover. I'll certainly have that up on the Facebook page, but they approach a fire. And when they get close, they see the silhouette of professor fe. And, you know, he's already

276
00:26:49,215 --> 00:26:54,924
sabotage them. So I guess it turned about is fair play, and they thoroughly

277
00:26:55,383 --> 00:27:00,038
wreck his campsite while he's sleeping, but as they're leaving donald trips,

278
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:00,997
waking

279
00:27:01,456 --> 00:27:02,196
the figure,

280
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:06,378
And as he gets up, it is revealed that it is not,

281
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:08,792
but it is

282
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,262
an unpleasant looking man with a German accent.

283
00:27:12,655 --> 00:27:15,555
Who claims to be a professor von

284
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:18,075
from their university of Rotterdam.

285
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:29,785
So professor Von tulip is looking at his reps boat and supplies a gas and the duck Scrooge just feeling incredibly guilty.

286
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:37,317
And, you know, Donald points out, you know you're here's your gun. It isn't her hurt. This is a bad idea because the professor

287
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:42,871
turns the gun on them and command years their supplies. And

288
00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:51,615
Eric, you wanna tell us what the ducks find out as he paddle off. It was a mask. It was professor Mc Al along.

289
00:27:53,663 --> 00:27:55,557
Yeah. Professor Mc is

290
00:27:56,014 --> 00:27:59,782
pretty prepared. He seems to have really thought about his nefarious.

291
00:28:00,454 --> 00:28:00,954
So

292
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:17,111
the Ducktales have lost round two and they... In in the morning they figure out there there's a couple of bad things. Right? They can't patch the boat. And they're not on a sand like they thought they were it's a it's a little island that is surrounded entirely by crocodile.

293
00:28:17,944 --> 00:28:19,401
So they they kinda brainstorm

294
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:20,876
what are their options

295
00:28:21,453 --> 00:28:21,953
and

296
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:26,897
they land on another plan that involves killing another crocodile.

297
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:46,170
You know, you go with what you Al and what they have is in the tons of crocodile. It's true. They've got poisoned heart attack and they've got crocodile. So So they feed another crocodile and they use its skin to disguise themselves to get away from the rest of them. And you know, Eric, you didn't get to

298
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:52,030
join us in the mystery of the swamp episode, but I think you read that story.

299
00:28:52,485 --> 00:28:56,540
This this whole page, you know, the du disco is d

300
00:28:57,478 --> 00:29:07,671
as the crocodile and the the sand Barks this this I felt like it was kind of a callback to history of the swamp. Sure. So on the next page the Ducktales,

301
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:14,225
you know, they see that they've got some easy grass land walking coming up ahead until they come to a very deep gu

302
00:29:14,565 --> 00:29:21,699
and it's necessary to cross on a suspicious looking boulder. You wanna tell us about the boulder the boulder

303
00:29:22,116 --> 00:29:22,616
is

304
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:24,865
elephant not done.

305
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,105
Yes. So

306
00:29:27,485 --> 00:29:28,825
they start an elephant,

307
00:29:29,205 --> 00:29:33,225
and this actually works out pretty well for them because the elephant

308
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:45,721
t off in the direction that they need to go. So they make some really great time. Well me think about they like, oh, look Al frequently that. That's not that's normal. Let's keep going. That's true. I didn't think about that.

309
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,135
You know, these are... I I like these panels with the elephant.

310
00:29:50,709 --> 00:30:04,763
Startled and running away. The backgrounds look really cool. Al elephant itself looks neat. I like them Al lot. Yeah. And then on the next page, I think are some of the the very pretty panels with the elephant crossing the river with the Ducktales still on their back,

311
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:07,476
the Ducktales grabbing, some bananas

312
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:09,965
to subs off of

313
00:30:10,303 --> 00:30:12,559
and eventually coming to

314
00:30:12,897 --> 00:30:14,953
near the W b River. I

315
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,680
that clark really enjoyed the

316
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:29,985
making him a key part in two parts of the story. And really just like maybe that's every turns of going, you know, writing on the back of Al office is... Hopefully, we're so than getting it crocodile out sure.

317
00:30:30,324 --> 00:30:33,440
But, you know, include that in the story so make it that's like, oh, that's, you know,

318
00:30:34,294 --> 00:30:37,112
right hell this. Yeah. It does look like he had fun

319
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:38,510
depicting the elephants.

320
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:42,586
It's a good thing because by the end of it, he's gonna have to draw a lot of elephants.

321
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:47,354
Just give us back that's what it was. Yeah. So still on this page, we

322
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,751
transitioned back to professor Mc

323
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:52,081
who almost immediately

324
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:54,675
spots the almost as ex extinct

325
00:30:55,132 --> 00:31:01,196
and as he's about to capture him, Donald pops up and trips him and intending to take his net.

326
00:31:01,575 --> 00:31:09,078
And on the next page, of course, Mc is shocked to see him this is a a fun exchange. You know, He asks

327
00:31:09,456 --> 00:31:16,416
how did you get here? Donald tells him I took the bus, and he says, well, you'll take the hears back pulling out a gun.

328
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:19,432
Fortunately, the nephew has a nice

329
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:20,765
late forties

330
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,845
slingshot every every kid needs to have a slingshot

331
00:31:24,225 --> 00:31:24,725
and

332
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:33,290
peg him right in the eye winning round three as he says, So they managed to run off professor Mc

333
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:38,329
who, you know, needs to plot and scheme and he ponder.

334
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:39,883
So in the version,

335
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:43,588
Eric that we're reading, he says, he thinks to himself.

336
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,960
There must be a native village around here where I can hire some assistance.

337
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,140
Al least see Donald about to catch the butterfly.

338
00:31:52,793 --> 00:32:02,165
Eric, can I share with you my screen again so you can see what that looks like on the original printing? I'm almost scared see. Yeah. This one's not great.

339
00:32:03,895 --> 00:32:04,812
Yeah. Yeah.

340
00:32:06,647 --> 00:32:11,294
So again, we've got... We've got the kind of African

341
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:12,211
savage

342
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:14,142
care share, but...

343
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,816
But even more so unfortunately.

344
00:32:17,314 --> 00:32:21,300
Yeah. Alright. So on the next page, we see him

345
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,500
having

346
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,340
encountered

347
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,035
the the narrator box says that Mc fe makes a deal with some very rough

348
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:31,915
savages. That's the term that he uses.

349
00:32:32,455 --> 00:32:36,475
And he says in in the version you and I read, it's he says now you

350
00:32:37,015 --> 00:32:41,843
understand for two false teeth. Oh, no. In the version you and I read, he says you

351
00:32:42,182 --> 00:32:58,714
understand for two confederate dollars here to capture these little boys and hold them until I tell you to let them go. And and in the original, he said for two false teeth here to capture these fat juicy little boys and hold them until I tell you to let them go. And

352
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:06,189
I'm not gonna read what they say, but it's implied that there just cited it, the prospect of eating them as cannibal.

353
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:11,536
And and if you look, if you compare Eric, it looks like there was some artwork

354
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:18,683
slipped in to kinda stretch this panel out. Yes and totally excise that panel referencing

355
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:19,535
cannibalism.

356
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:28,620
Yes. So the stakes are really high on this page. And we see we transition back to the Nephews use who have...

357
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,940
Donald is pursuing the butterfly,

358
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,580
they've gathered a big jar of caterpillars

359
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,820
that wanted an nephews

360
00:33:36,174 --> 00:33:38,891
would like to take home to their nature teacher.

361
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:44,798
While they're pondering how much they're looking forward to getting home we see them captured

362
00:33:45,415 --> 00:33:49,628
with spears point to at them. This is parallel. That's a kinda standard...

363
00:33:49,966 --> 00:34:00,715
Yeah. Although though usually, they're the ones kinda getting out of it. And you know, in this one, Barks hasn't really turned them into the junior wood ups that he would later. Right? That would that would

364
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:09,961
look up information about the place they're traveling to and probably would not harm any of the the local wildlife.

365
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:10,660
No.

366
00:34:11,872 --> 00:34:13,849
So meanwhile, Donald

367
00:34:14,347 --> 00:34:19,295
has been in pursuit of the butterfly for quite some time. This is a pretty cool series.

368
00:34:20,228 --> 00:34:27,472
How he gets the butterfly. The butterfly flies nearly off a cliff, but it gets... It gets puff backwards

369
00:34:28,144 --> 00:34:31,001
by an elephant Trunk right into Donald neck.

370
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:43,440
So he when he looks down, oh, I like the line that he says, and elephant blew him back to me. That's two favors, I owe them. And then he's shocked twenty season in this goalie. There's like a gathering of thousands of elephants.

371
00:34:44,693 --> 00:34:52,199
So Donald just journeys back to his to his camp. And I don't think elephants really do this. I don't think they gather on these numbers, but

372
00:34:52,820 --> 00:35:12,108
it's a it's a pretty cool image. Yeah. That's a wonderful plot device. Yeah. So Donald gets back and he doesn't see the kids and he realized to his horror that Mick fe must have them. So he goes to his camp and mc fe he's sure enough gloves that he'll trouble him for that

373
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:19,860
butterfly and he points out that they are over at that native village where there's some ominous drums in the background.

374
00:35:20,294 --> 00:35:23,384
And so he explains that he's gonna trade the nephews

375
00:35:23,761 --> 00:35:26,771
for that butterfly. So in the version,

376
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:27,927
we

377
00:35:28,479 --> 00:35:29,898
see it references

378
00:35:30,277 --> 00:35:36,550
their heads being shrunk, because I guess voodoo head shrinking is considered a little less offensive.

379
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:38,341
Well, cannibalism.

380
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:43,905
I think little the more when see there's the head you could interpret that head out of the village.

381
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,980
For Pet. I think you can let that's that that's a little more... I'm not justifying it. But I'm saying it's word I

382
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:55,195
as opposed to. Right. I do think where they are in a.

383
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:57,555
Yeah. Yep. There's the stew.

384
00:35:58,788 --> 00:36:10,724
So anyway, Donald has no choice but to give him the butterfly and he gets the nephews used back and I agree that the professor wins round four, and they're kinda doing

385
00:36:12,065 --> 00:36:19,565
just angrily, fortunately not literally. And they're they're noting that the professor is gonna beat them to the coast, and then

386
00:36:19,942 --> 00:36:26,199
Donald has a realization after one of the nephews make a joke about catching the ride on another elephant,

387
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:27,515
because that

388
00:36:27,933 --> 00:36:31,999
reminds him of that convention of elephants. And on the next page,

389
00:36:32,418 --> 00:36:41,324
he shows them where the river bends bends deeply where there's the opening of that pass. So he tells the Nephews

390
00:36:41,704 --> 00:36:43,244
to light a bunch of fires

391
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:44,324
which

392
00:36:45,344 --> 00:36:49,893
deeply alarms the smoke from the fires deeply alarms the elephants

393
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:50,930
who

394
00:36:51,268 --> 00:36:59,120
stampede and terror towards the gap where the river meets that big gu. And the way to repair your favorite.

395
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:03,067
Yeah. Exactly. This is this is

396
00:37:03,939 --> 00:37:12,755
another kind of example of the casual animal cruelty in this one because, like, they're not directly hurting these elephants, but I'm sure a bunch of them are

397
00:37:13,294 --> 00:37:15,651
worse for the wear after the stampede.

398
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:16,751
But

399
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:25,711
I can't argue with the fact that on the next page, we get one of the coolest panels that Barks has gotten to do so far. Oh, yeah.

400
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:29,261
As the stampede of thunder elephants

401
00:37:29,734 --> 00:37:31,510
crashes into professor and Mc.

402
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:40,586
Panel is boat across. It's a it's a great half page panel very detailed. Donald in the distance saying all that for a butterfly.

403
00:37:41,085 --> 00:37:41,585
And,

404
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:53,214
you know, Mc gets patched up. The ducks patch him up at least. They rescue they rec come near the butterfly from him and head back with the butterfly and the jar of caterpillars.

405
00:37:53,669 --> 00:38:00,334
Any other thoughts on on that one that's just that's such a cool panel. That that... you know, you guys spoke pivot a panel. I'm like, that's

406
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:03,426
anybody reads that's gonna be the paper panel that Al.

407
00:38:04,104 --> 00:38:32,474
I I sometimes wonder what I see our like comics is it's someone gonna draw that picture and then had to come up with the story to go around that picture. So just for an excuse to draw that picture because it's done with such detail and such such appreciation. That's really the shows stopper. Yeah. I agree. I I had the same thought. And this is a pretty low resolution one that I'm showing you, but you can see the when he's gonna go back to this well and show a dinosaur stampede.

408
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:39,959
It's a pretty cool panel. It's not quite as need is the elephant one I think. No. There's... Well, we're actually got the up one, but it's good. Yeah. Yeah.

409
00:38:41,038 --> 00:38:49,257
And, again, that's for Forbidden Valley. And this is that's like, ten years later, so we won't we won't do that for a pretty good span. But, anyway, we

410
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:52,761
transitioned to the boat to to the Ducktales

411
00:38:52,681 --> 00:39:10,873
on a return ship to the Us and the docs seemed to have reached a bit of a deterrent with Professor Mc because he's still sc at them, but they're not, like, actively trying to murder each other at least. But professor mc fe is just like, despair that his life's purpose. Is

412
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:27,499
done. He lost the butterfly that he was dreaming of finding and is is really down in the dumps. So Donald tells the kids to go off and play and he's gonna keep an eye on the old guy in case he tries something funny. And on the next page, this is where we get that like, suicide for

413
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,713
comedic purpose where

414
00:39:30,132 --> 00:39:35,125
he says that he has nothing to live for, so he plans to jump into the ocean.

415
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:39,234
But Al he about to jump in, He sees an almost

416
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:48,637
and then looking around, he sees even more and more and he and Donald point out that, wow, Now that butterfly is

417
00:39:49,016 --> 00:39:50,275
basically worthless.

418
00:39:51,149 --> 00:40:01,614
And they wonder where it's coming from and then the nephews around the corner and reveal that their jar of butterflies turns out to have been a whole brood of almost this ex extinct

419
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:02,774
and

420
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:08,589
how disappointed their teachers going to be. And that's the end of darkest Africa.

421
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:12,389
Yeah. Not not the longest of stories.

422
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:14,789
You know, this one, I

423
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:23,195
I only had this one issue of it. So i I didn't I don't think I read this one too much as a kid. But I definitely

424
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:27,276
remember enjoying this one more than I do

425
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:30,481
today. That's fair. And it's it's a good standard.

426
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:40,734
Or story, you know, they get put over by there like couple times times, and then they have to use their resources and like, all good adventure stories. You live by using a stampede.

427
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:48,111
You know? That the and end the putting he been and end it does become... you know, they're not the shiny heroes. It's like, oh, well, i victory

428
00:40:48,463 --> 00:41:03,122
more of a moral one because we didn't give what we wanted it. But the bad guy undefeated. Right. Yeah. So so you enjoyed this one? I enjoy aspects of it. Thought I I I... The eventually part of it dude was the elephants for good, but Mean, yeah, the lot of the depictions.

429
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,543
Even in the booth first, you know you a that version.

430
00:41:07,021 --> 00:41:08,397
Still questionable and

431
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:11,165
for that reason, i'm like, yeah, I'm not heard this one Al lot.

432
00:41:11,857 --> 00:41:19,110
Yeah. But I did like I thought that the title was good because it's kind of dark story. It's all about revenge.

433
00:41:19,683 --> 00:41:42,100
And and every it's all about revenge and it is called Barks africa, you know, revenge. This come from with our card you could think about it. Yeah. That's true. It ends up being a very fitting title. Yeah. I mean, I'm torn on this one because, like, Al lot of a lot of that doesn't sit well with me, obviously, but there's there is a lot to enjoy about this one. There's some neat adventure.

434
00:41:42,719 --> 00:42:01,087
I do think some of the transitions in this one are a little bit jarring. Right? I think maybe it could have stood to have been like, two to four pages longer or something because, like, it's not just the fact that they get where they're going very quickly. It's just that things happen almost too quickly in this one. But

435
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:07,849
there's there's certainly some neat artwork work in this one It it didn't I wasn't as bothered

436
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:08,889
by

437
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:11,529
some of the, like, racial stereotypes

438
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:15,544
as I was in like Volcano Valley where.

439
00:42:16,763 --> 00:42:20,100
That's fair. Yeah. Where I think it was like, more

440
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:33,340
important to the story. That's not to excuse these, you know. They don't no. But yeah the though those characters being the... The native characters were very much a background of the story. Right. To a degree, not like,

441
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:48,310
kind of valley where it was like, no their whole stereotype is the the stereotype of was pushing the story along. No. Right. You could have, like, taken them out of the story and just kind of changed it a little bit without really affecting it that much.

442
00:42:49,124 --> 00:43:01,069
Because, like, most of the danger came from, like, African wildlife and and the Ducktales fighting against Mc fin in this. So, you know, again, that's not to excuse it at all.

443
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:06,064
But but at least it wasn't like, the stereotypes were not fundamental to story.

444
00:43:07,103 --> 00:43:23,941
Yeah. So so this one this one's alright. This is kind of to me a middle Barks story. The the general consensus you know, we like to look on the index page to see where the community has rated this one. And I'm finding Eric that a lot of these stories

445
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:33,785
where there are these stereotypes that I might think would kind of pull down the rating, it isn't really pulled down. And I I

446
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:44,954
fact that that's because index is pretty ancient as far as the Internet goes. Mh you. So I... I'm pretty sure it's been around for I think since the nineties.

447
00:43:45,295 --> 00:43:46,234
That's the original

448
00:43:46,575 --> 00:43:50,529
there. Yeah. So like, many of the votes are

449
00:43:51,069 --> 00:43:53,849
from long enough ago that many people

450
00:43:54,390 --> 00:44:04,924
maybe are not taking these things into account. Or maybe they just don't care about it, and they're just enjoying the story the way they enjoyed it as a kid, and that's that's fine.

451
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:23,464
Maybe they were going up for printing and not the original printing. Yeah. That's true. Again, I I think it's hard to avoid some of the bones of this story. But... But yeah. So so for index, this one has a seven point seven out of ten, which is good enough for one hundred and fifty second.

452
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,936
Out of all about forty one thousand

453
00:44:26,274 --> 00:44:27,572
Disney comics,

454
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:34,254
placing it pretty high in the ninety nine percentile. As far as like relative to the other

455
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:40,959
stories we've read, that definitely places it in the upper half. Time tied with stories like

456
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:51,654
terror of the river and Raja Donald. You know, I think this one is, I guess well regarded by fans. It does have some pretty cool adventure and some pretty

457
00:44:52,034 --> 00:44:52,534
memorable

458
00:44:53,354 --> 00:44:53,854
panels.

459
00:44:54,274 --> 00:45:05,722
I would say that these these this version of the docs they're a little less developed. Right? I think Huey, doing and Louie are gonna evolve a little bit as we go along. Yeah. I can turn that one. We've we've already

460
00:45:06,193 --> 00:45:09,327
talked about what's dated or archaic in this one

461
00:45:09,744 --> 00:45:19,318
and what's retro grade? What's problematic? Obviously, the the kind of overall view of Africans as as savages and just the term darkest Africa.

462
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,410
So this one doesn't doesn't hold up.

463
00:45:23,064 --> 00:45:23,864
That well,

464
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:24,724
but,

465
00:45:25,304 --> 00:45:28,404
you know, has some has some fun pool elements.

466
00:45:29,504 --> 00:45:43,158
Unfortunately I don't feel like there's a ton of educational value either in this one. No. There there could have been an opportunity to learn a little bit about butterflies. Only one of them was even a real one. You know, the the dog Latin is is kind of fun. But

467
00:45:43,736 --> 00:45:49,164
but, you know, I I do really like it when I learned something cool from one of these Barks stories.

468
00:45:49,819 --> 00:46:04,402
We both... We kind of acknowledge that the elephant stampede is the clear winner for panels in this one. Where were there any other panels that came to mind for you? Oh like I like... I you pointed out the one with the where

469
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:40,019
see the butterfly originally put the arrow in it. Pointing it out. That was a really neat just background front panel. And, of course, Barks is really well with anything with silhouette spots to do some contrast with the color and the cover was just very impressive to me. Yeah. And that was a rei imagining that he didn't do the cover that I showed to you, but it did... It did re... It was repurposed from his panels. So... Okay. Yeah. Because the original March of Comment had, like Al totally un unrelated cover. But I agree those silhouette ones are really cool. And you know, look kinda randomly, I really liked the sequence where Donald is pursuing the

470
00:46:40,638 --> 00:46:41,696
butterfly and that elephants

471
00:46:42,074 --> 00:46:46,484
trunk pops it into his net. It was kinda weird that it was neat. Yeah. Any...

472
00:46:46,941 --> 00:46:50,809
Oh as as far as appearances, I don't wanna leave that out,

473
00:46:51,586 --> 00:46:58,048
not really any appearances and any... He didn't use this one as inspiration for an oil painting. Or lit

474
00:46:58,546 --> 00:47:09,170
And as far as I know, this didn't really inspire any of the Duck tales episodes in either of the two series. Any any closing thoughts, any final thoughts for this one?

475
00:47:10,087 --> 00:47:25,131
No. I mean, it was it was a good standard adventure story. A flu different for me to donald or, you know, he's out for money or he's gets wrapped into something by accident or he yeah I was greed or his anger gets carried away. This one's is just about revenge

476
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,050
down

477
00:47:26,389 --> 00:47:46,057
don't kinda hero this one, which is i again, a little bit different than a lot of the comics where donald is the one who comes up with the plan, even if he doesn't find a better front better her butterfly the end, for me, he he had done on top the building. His own his own thinking. And amazon planning not by accident or the nip is pulling his standing on the fire. And you know, I had characterized

478
00:47:46,369 --> 00:48:02,360
him Al being kinda ro in the beginning. And he definitely... He definitely was, but you're right. He's he he is the resourceful one. Too much of this one. And he does end up being very heroic by the end, you know, saving nephews and even taking care of Mc

479
00:48:02,737 --> 00:48:08,169
you know, patching them and trying to stop him from killing himself. Yeah. So

480
00:48:08,509 --> 00:48:14,451
that's at least some somewhat of an arc for him. Excellent. Well, Eric, I really appreciate you

481
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:19,369
joining us again coming back. Yeah. No problem. I hope

482
00:48:19,987 --> 00:48:27,999
everyone will join us next time when we get to talk about a very famous and very well regarded

483
00:48:28,393 --> 00:48:30,751
story, the old castle secret.

484
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,929
Yeah. Should be a good one. This is...

485
00:48:33,308 --> 00:48:37,264
I I like to say Eric that this is the true origin story.

486
00:48:37,878 --> 00:48:38,378
Frustration.

487
00:48:38,755 --> 00:48:45,955
Yeah. If anyone would like to reach out, we have our Facebook page for Barks remarks as well as
