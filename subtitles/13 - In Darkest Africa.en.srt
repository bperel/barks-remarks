00:00:21,382 --> 00:00:22,820
Hello, and welcome to Barks

2
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:37,861
The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer Al artist of the greatest Donald and unscrew comments of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological

3
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:48,545
publishing or order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,660
Welcome back everyone to Barks remarks. I have here a returning guest host. I'm gonna ask him to

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,024
introduce himself and also tell us the worst thing he's ever done in pursuit of rear butterfly.

6
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,540
Hello. My name is Eric Currently. Patty be back. And the worst thing I have is to done in the pursuit of,

7
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,720
I would have to say is probably Through some rocks and creek. We're trying to do biology project in high school.

8
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:30,500
Where we had to cats do a bug collection. I don't know if those are rare I'm sure it change butterflies. And when that failed after some rocks they agreed because scratches are fine. There you go. I didn't I didn't think you'd have an actual response to that. So awesome.

9
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,860
So yes, as alluded to,

10
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:34,573
Regarding the Butterfly,

11
00:01:34,952 --> 00:01:38,168
we are going to be talking today about darkest

12
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:39,007
Africa

13
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,460
fairly unusual

14
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,159
Donald Inducks adventure.

15
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,435
You know, it kinda reminds me of the, like, what would you do for a Inducks bar. Right? These these Inducks

16
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:50,275
and

17
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:55,195
and professor Mc are are gonna end up doing a lot and pursue this butterfly.

18
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:58,930
Yes. I have to say for a a a very

19
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,770
poor

20
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,190
duck. Donald gets around the world a lot.

21
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:06,345
Yeah. Yeah. It helps when your bank rolled by

22
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:07,265
random

23
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:08,345
wealthy,

24
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:11,105
butterfly collector slash ben.

25
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:11,979
Yes.

26
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,873
Alright. So, yeah, Eric.

27
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:19,622
Let's get into it. Again, we are talking about Barks Africa.

28
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:21,712
And usually,

29
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:25,281
I mentioned when the story was published,

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,990
This is another of those kind of ne ones that was originally published in one of the weird

31
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,330
giveaway comics,

32
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,930
called March of comics or boys and girls March of comics,

33
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:50,985
to go into the full title. It was one of those that where they could publish it to be given away in, like, shoe stores or or or wherever, and they would put the store's name would go on the comic. Right? So so they don't have...

34
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,932
I don't have the actual date for it. We just know that this was published

35
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:56,863
near the beginning of nineteen

36
00:02:57,242 --> 00:03:01,339
forty eight and it was March of call number twenty. And

37
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:12,932
Eric since the last time I had you on, I've started to mention how many printing are listed in total in English for this one. And, you know, we were Gladstone for

38
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:16,265
Christmas on Bear mountain and because that was,

39
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:28,712
you know, such an important one that's had a a lot of printing. This one's pretty occasionally printed. Right? Including the original run, there were only five printing total. Okay. And and

40
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:32,403
can can you guess why this one probably

41
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:36,678
has fewer than many. Just gonna guess the demand wasn't there.

42
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:37,877
Possibly

43
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:39,175
some of the arts.

44
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:45,626
Yes Well yeah. There's there's a few... There's a few issues with this one that

45
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:50,750
have you know, stoked a little bit of controversy. It's it's a little bit of a darker

46
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:53,247
I would almost say Al little bit cruel.

47
00:03:53,646 --> 00:04:02,938
Comic. Right? I I don't find character is very light on this one. But anyway, we'll we'll get into that. Let's see. This is a twenty two pager

48
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:03,816
and

49
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:05,331
there is

50
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:13,425
some good backgrounds to go into for this one. But before we do that, Eric, would you like to offer us up your

51
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:16,991
synopsis for this story. Sure. This says

52
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:23,292
we're donald and duct, help is Nephew chase butterflies and runs into a

53
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:29,288
another collective butter butterflies and becomes it becomes survival and then gets rolled into

54
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:34,447
going through Africa. To catch the rarest of rare butterflies. Against this

55
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:41,026
rival collector who sabotage them. They sent potassium him Paging into

56
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,462
they catch the butterfly.

57
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:43,354
And.

58
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:51,680
Yeah. That's right. And and I would say no one no one comes out of this one looking particular really good in my opinion.

59
00:04:52,460 --> 00:05:03,127
No. So I I already mentioned that this is a March of comic story. This is our second march of comics. Give giveaway story. Mah raja Donald was the first one. And

60
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:14,530
this story also has the distinction of being one of the times that Carl Barks is gonna go back and copy himself. Because he's gonna basically

61
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:20,945
reuse this plot. You know Al later donald dot com called called Forbidden Valley. And

62
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:23,065
I like... I like that version,

63
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:27,234
I think a bit better than this one. They're very similar, but

64
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:39,129
the big stampede at the end we get is a bunch of dinosaurs, so that's pretty cool. That's pretty good. Yeah. Although the elephant stampede in this is is definitely impressive. Yeah. This one

65
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:42,200
was subject to a lot of post

66
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:43,316
publications

67
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:50,520
sensor ship, which is is pretty understandable because this one does traffic in some pretty unfortunate

68
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:51,454
stereotypes,

69
00:05:52,150 --> 00:06:02,960
which, Eric, you you really didn't get to see too much of. I think you probably saw some of it because it it was really in the stories Dna, and it couldn't...

70
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,240
It couldn't be completely covered up. But they did

71
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:14,208
do some like Disney censorship, you know, after the fact where they went back and kinda soften some of the racial

72
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:15,047
care

73
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:16,445
and

74
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:25,321
some of the the terms that were pretty questionable You know the time frame as to when that happened? I think that it was

75
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:33,169
immediately after, like, when... As soon as they went back to reprint it, and I don't know exactly how many years. But

76
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:42,485
I'm guessing he was probably within the first decade or so. Okay. That's pretty good recognizing in changing it as soon as they can. So while still publishing something that's

77
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,160
questionable.

78
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:50,075
We're recognizing the I give them and that's that's not. So gonna it's around for a a few issues few me things.

79
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:51,309
Right.

80
00:06:52,006 --> 00:07:03,065
And then, you know, as often happens, they probably will adjust it over the years and keep fine tuning it until I'm guessing this one's probably not gonna see a lot of reprint

81
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:09,360
anymore outside of, like, the the collections that they do. But but it is worth noting right, that these

82
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:25,617
attitudes even though we're not gonna justify them, they were totally in keeping with the time. Right? I don't know if you've read any other comments from this era. I was actually exposed to one just not to... Recently, I got from a library called the

83
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:30,442
involving a super comment called the green Turtle about a Chinese.

84
00:07:31,273 --> 00:07:32,691
American super superhero

85
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:59,050
that I found very interesting and was very in fact kind of Al. So I thought that was a an interesting contrast to what reading this one as well. Mh And and that one... I mean, I'm I'm sure it had problems. Was it some. Oh, oh, absolutely. What I what I read was it was a a new walker, a new agent american doctor who had written and and he brought correct called the the shadow. And so he created this backstory

86
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:21,750
to this asian American hero that's featured in the in the forties and wrote about the Chinese American who had created the zero, but at the time could not push him as a Chinese hero. And so this hero, you never saw his space in the comic. It was always his back or you always saw he was always hiding a space because couldn't show that he was in Chinese American.

87
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,265
Fighting Japanese

88
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:36,903
involved in China and World too and the japanese were just horribly so kind. Know that Al as they were back then. So many were back then. Yeah. Had read that and now reading this one. Yeah. It's a it's been interesting

89
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,180
week and a half for me reading those. Along that. Yeah. To to me the ones that come to mind,

90
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,570
you know, the ones that I'm most familiar with are, like, the asterisk

91
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:47,865
stories.

92
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:48,819
And

93
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:59,142
ten ten or ten ten. And those have kind of the same... Those are, like, almost the exact same error and our incredibly famous well of con have some of these same stereotypes.

94
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,236
Again, we're not using it, but we're, like,

95
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:06,407
understanding that this wasn't unique to Karl Barks. This really was

96
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:09,457
just kind of the way you depicted savages

97
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:14,132
at the time. So... And and we'll we'll see a little bit of growth from him

98
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:24,329
moving forward we'll also see some other problematic stories, but, you know, as always, I don't wanna be labor too much. But, you know, we do have to recognize that no. I'll share

99
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:27,646
on the Facebook page, some of the panels

100
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:28,844
that

101
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:38,798
we can look at to compare some of the changes that they've made. You know, some other interesting background for this one, I think is apart from, like, the racial stereotypes.

102
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:55,213
This one it's almost like he went out of his way to make it off to reprint it because it has some like some pretty brutal treatment of animals in this one. And and then that old, like, saw of the the old trope of the comedic attempted

103
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,157
suicide at the end. Right? So there's there's some content here. And

104
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:02,984
times have changed. Yes. Yes. They have.

105
00:10:03,822 --> 00:10:07,874
And and before we talk a little bit more about this historical,

106
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:15,318
one of our newer features is trying to wrap our mouths around some of the titles from

107
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:21,800
publication from around the world. So we've got we've got four of them today, Eric, I think you're gonna do

108
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:27,885
Spain and Italy. Right? Which used me France, in Germany. Alright. So

109
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:31,325
in French, the title is la,

110
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:33,979
x stan,

111
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:37,644
which I'm thinking must be the chase of the almost

112
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,712
extinct because for quasi extinct

113
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:46,525
I... I'm going out on limb. I didn't even look that one up. Go for... Go for Spain. In Spain

114
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:47,485
in

115
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:48,565
Cora,

116
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:49,765
the Africa.

117
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,060
The heart of Africa. Right?

118
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,660
And in Germany, we've got

119
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,220
Mori,

120
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,075
and that's the last

121
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:04,498
more abundance. I think we're we're thinking that Mori must be the name of the almost

122
00:11:05,592 --> 00:11:07,705
in German. And then go for Italy.

123
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,446
Chase of the

124
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:14,643
purchase

125
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:16,935
which is probably the name of the butterfly.

126
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:23,395
Right. I think it's just Donald and the extinct. Oh, it's not buddy know? Don, Patrick. Yeah. Yeah. Oh,

127
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:42,645
okay. That makes more sense. Like the edge should be in. Right. I think it's just Donald and the extinct Al Patrick. Yeah. So none of those titles really match English one, which is pretty interesting. Eric, do you know kinda switching to the historical context here. Do do you know anything about the term Barks Africa?

128
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:46,071
Only what I've seen in media

129
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:48,583
where they would often call

130
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,092
to remember this. What's his name that famous

131
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:52,944
hunter

132
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:56,261
excuse me. He was played by Sean Conner in the movie

133
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:12,055
league of officially general. Oh, Al K? Allen Court. Yes. They offer refer going after Al the dark continent. Yeah. Yeah. That's the other term. Right? Start this Africa or the dark content. Yeah. So I actually

134
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:18,015
just happened to learn about this a couple months ago in a podcast about

135
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:21,710
about atrocities and the Belgian Congo. It was

136
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:23,545
what's his name? Word

137
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:25,818
not lord. It was Stanley.

138
00:12:26,235 --> 00:12:27,932
Henry Stanley, you know, Famous

139
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:31,201
Explorer the guy who said

140
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:33,291
supposedly said doctor Livingston.

141
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:37,440
Presume he... He popularized that term in his

142
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:38,815
in one of his books.

143
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:43,673
And, you know, it... It's just what you think it's meant to, like, refer to Africa

144
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:51,104
a very savage in mysterious place. So that's that's where we get that title. It's not really...

145
00:12:51,522 --> 00:13:04,953
Yeah. Certainly. It's certainly not not a good term. To use for africa these days. I I also found interesting that this story has a lot of examples of what what I learned is called dog latin. Right? So there's pig latin.

146
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:08,229
Sharon and there's Dog Latin. And Dog Latin,

147
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:11,240
Dog Latin is when you take

148
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:17,480
a word and you like fake latin. Right. So the almost extinct is just the almost

149
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,795
stink That actually... There's there's a there's a term for that practice.

150
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:24,375
Okay. Yeah. So I like...

151
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:26,547
I like learning that. And then

152
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:28,900
just out of curiosity, I Googled.

153
00:13:29,556 --> 00:13:32,449
I think I Googled like, cut throat and Butterfly

154
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:41,237
collector or or Butterfly collector and murder just to see if anything came up. And it came up with an Npr story from about

155
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:44,546
thirteen years ago about a dude

156
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:52,470
I mean, the story was more about the fish and wildlife guy. But who he went under undercover to trap an international butterfly thief.

157
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:53,245
From.

158
00:13:54,405 --> 00:14:03,956
Yes. And the guy touted himself as the world's most wanted butterfly sm. So. They can't leave as load competition, but should go for it. Yeah. Absolutely.

159
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:06,932
That sound like somebody have a Barks side cartoon. Yeah.

160
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:13,872
Let's see. I I kinda skipped over the value range for this one. For whatever reason, I had trouble finding

161
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:26,684
the, like, top top value, but I found that there was an eight point o that sold for twenty one hundred dollars. So okay. You know, expensive, but maybe not Al a range for some people. And

162
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:29,094
let's see notable appearances.

163
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,251
We we have professor Mc.

164
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:48,722
I don't even remember the name of the the random ben manufacturer. I don't know if he's even named, but but no one in this one is ever going to really appear again. And then I like to talk about which version of the characters we get in here. And I would say this is a good example of our our very stubborn

165
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:59,960
version of Donald. He's also very resourceful on this one though. And, you know, he's he's not quite a villain in this one, but he's definitely, like, willing to kind of meet

166
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:05,535
professor Mc at his level I guess you could say. So I I I just I looked at up.

167
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:11,739
This hector is sir that bug monthly. Oh, yes. Thank you. Because he does have a great

168
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:16,503
Barks name. Yes. Awesome. Alright. I think

169
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:23,286
we are ready to dive into the story itself. Eric, you let me know if you have any reflections

170
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:24,219
after

171
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,290
talking about some of these pages. Sure thing. Alright. So

172
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:32,695
Darkest Africa as you mentioned opens with the du

173
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:33,935
catching

174
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:43,540
butterflies. Donald is helping the nephews out with the class project of theirs. And, you know, they're all they're all really into it. They seem to be having

175
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:45,353
some good clean fun.

176
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:55,322
I'm not sure about the fact that they're just kind of like tossing a bunch of butterflies loose into a big jumble in a cigar box, but, you know, it's a school project.

177
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,249
Donald seems pretty knowledgeable too about butterflies. Right? He

178
00:15:59,588 --> 00:16:01,606
identifies the f F

179
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:04,842
from the tropics at the very beginning. And

180
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:10,930
by the end of the page, he is pursuing a new kind of butterfly that they've never seen,

181
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:17,540
and he... His net crosses with another net from an unidentified collector

182
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:37,420
simultaneously. That's gonna be interesting that these boys is have randomly... I butterflies in the park and the fair ones, and they just have cross some... Like, there's some kind of butterfly magnet in this part. That which withdrawal these referred butterflies. So those the collectors there. Yeah. But so pop. It's Ducktales, Butterfly district.

183
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,960
You. Alright. So

184
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,455
Donald, and this This new collector get in an argument

185
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:54,910
over this butterfly, and the collector indicates that it's a very rare pip con from Brazil. And, you know, he's very determined to have him for his collection.

186
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,630
So they get in in a sc

187
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:02,600
And Donald kinda gets... We see him get a bright idea. He

188
00:17:03,218 --> 00:17:05,675
removes his net suddenly and

189
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:14,101
smash the net over the head of the other collector, grabs the collector's net and is able to scoop up the butterfly

190
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:26,198
himself. And in the background, we see a very well dressed gentleman kind of taking in this scene. This is interesting. Because very, rarely you see all being more headed than somebody else. He normally

191
00:17:26,736 --> 00:17:32,525
I mean, he he did kurt anger, but actually out outside the guy to get ahead of and get what he wanted, which

192
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:41,258
looking at and now you get a little bit of foreshadowing of what can i happen later on in the story at least you guys going Al it. Yeah. That's true. It's it's necessary

193
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:44,254
in this story, I think for Donald to be

194
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:52,940
more strategic than he usually would be. Yes. Alright. So on the next page, you know, Donald this triumph and the other collector

195
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,298
is fuming

196
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:55,657
and the

197
00:17:55,996 --> 00:18:10,125
well dress gentleman approaches him. And I like, I like his line. He just says young man, I like the way you did that dirty trick. You know, no one is No one is being shy about how under handed their being. And this guy introduced

198
00:18:10,425 --> 00:18:23,578
as you said, he's got a great Barks see a name sir Nat bug Mo, the famous butterfly collector he wants to recruit Donald to help him complete his collect And specifically, he'd like to have him go to Africa

199
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:28,847
to bring back the butterfly that we're gonna know so much about by the end of the almost

200
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:29,979
stink.

201
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:31,255
Donald,

202
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:45,465
upon learning and it's in Africa blanche because that's very far away. And he's like, why why would you need me? And he indicates that, you know, Donald has just been boo Gladstone of the most cut through Butterfly collectors. There is.

203
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:47,497
Professor Vargas Mc.

204
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:53,897
And so, you know, he's probably gonna have another run with him if he chooses to go to Africa.

205
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:55,971
I like him. He's a butterfly collector.

206
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:59,815
But he has no net. Like, he just came towards your butterflies.

207
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:03,467
Yes. Yeah. That's true. He he came to

208
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:11,000
scout for another butterfly collector to do his dirty work, I guess. But, you know, that's what you find in the butterfly district. Absolutely.

209
00:19:11,554 --> 00:19:13,690
So on the next page the f user

210
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:17,082
are kinda saying now, it would be pretty neat to go to Africa.

211
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:25,530
You know, Donald is right right fully talking about what a pain in the butt. Would be all the things that he'd need to arrange while he's gone. And,

212
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,770
you know, they kinda give it up... The nephews

213
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:35,177
say that they might as well take the butterflies to their teacher, and they walk past professor

214
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:47,313
hiding behind a tree and he just snatch the whole collection and catches the taxi and runs off. I've gotta say I like the the the evil sn that is plastered across

215
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:52,087
Face in like ninety percent of his appearance. Yeah absolutely.

216
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:57,056
But, I mean, how you what can you be? When you stealing butterfly butterflies for kids?

217
00:19:57,475 --> 00:20:04,378
I mean. I just... That's just man. One the lower levels of hell right there. Yeah. That's almost Grinch. Right? Absolutely.

218
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:13,180
So Donald learns from a random farmer who heard him take the taxi that he's on his way to Africa.

219
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,275
So that's that's all it takes. Donald is driven by his need to get

220
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:19,235
revenge.

221
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:24,995
He's gonna take that job and just midway through this page we transition

222
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:31,890
to Half f. That's right. No transition per store for traveling. No adventures there. No team monsters

223
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,025
or pirates

224
00:20:33,762 --> 00:20:34,541
right Africa.

225
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:35,856
Right. And,

226
00:20:36,273 --> 00:20:37,888
you know, we even transition

227
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:40,850
immediately to the Butterfly, which

228
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,090
has a helpful arrow

229
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,444
pointing to where it is. It's a really a lovely scene of, like, Al

230
00:20:48,603 --> 00:21:02,117
lagoon with a lot of cool wild by really really great panel. Some nice depth to it too. We see a a native Al African native who spotted it, and it starts kind of a a a drum

231
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:04,570
transmission of of the message.

232
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:13,495
And go ahead and comment whatever you'd like, Eric. I'm gonna take a moment to share the original panels here with you for some of these.

233
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:16,083
Well, I just looking at that

234
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:21,921
native and just... Yeah. That's really question large. And if that's been changed,

235
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:23,074
yeah

236
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:36,713
those are red draws. Right? So we're we're looking out at the original art. And and, like to be fair, these These depictions are again, totally within the standard of of the time. They have the kind of, like,

237
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:38,252
sized

238
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,145
lip. That were we're were drawn for many black characters.

239
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:58,891
But it it's gonna get a little bit worse for some of these. Yeah. That's that's just better the disturbing the say. I'm glad did them. Yeah. I I agree. It was it was the right call. You know, in the panel that we see, there is some

240
00:21:59,308 --> 00:22:15,732
sort of pigeon talk to communicate the transmission But in the original panel... Oh, you know, I don't have that part. I actually don't know if they just retained that or not. I I am glad to see that they Al least, like, oh, it's not pigeon. I'm glad that

241
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:26,570
you know, making a made language is, I guess, arguably, not as offensive as using, like, the pigeon speak that you sometimes see. Yeah. Hey. That that's there.

242
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,650
So on the next page, we see the rest of this transmission

243
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,490
and

244
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:32,650
donald,

245
00:22:33,030 --> 00:23:00,577
you know, it gets back to Donald who's you know, at a camp. And in this panel that we see, he asks know you the voice of the drums, Mu jaw is the name of the native that he's talking to. And then in the original one, he's actually referred to as fuzzy was. Which which is both offensive and and confusing to me so... Yeah. But the the native says that the butterfly has been spotted on the upper w busy river

246
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:10,201
wan. And one is that... We you hear that a lot in, you know, this kind of media. That apparently is sw for for, like, master or loss.

247
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:20,178
Okay. And so the the Inducks break for... Their camp and they launch a boat to be on their way. And as they as they leave their boat off,

248
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:21,616
it's clear that

249
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:23,933
holes have been drilled in their boat

250
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:26,025
and about sinks

251
00:23:26,524 --> 00:23:31,059
and they see a note floating on the water that says, welcome to Africa

252
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:32,338
professor Mc.

253
00:23:32,837 --> 00:23:33,337
The.

254
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:33,875
Yes.

255
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:37,746
Did you wanna mention what you had found about

256
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:38,625
Lamb?

257
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:56,648
Yes. I did some research on the web bc just thinking I don't think it's real, but let's look it up. And what I misspelled it because in this one, it's spelled w h a n. When I was going and memory, I spelled it w a m. And it popped as of reference to the old serial comic... The phantom, which

258
00:23:56,986 --> 00:23:57,806
involved heavily

259
00:23:58,902 --> 00:24:01,353
in the jumble. If you know anything about the phantom.

260
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:03,372
From what I could find

261
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:11,456
the reference was some college created in the eighties. So I don't know if writers were pulling from other stuff older stuff because the phantom has been around

262
00:24:11,954 --> 00:24:45,837
forever, and they had that lost the top newly with the Fan. Was in Southeast asia was in Africa, which doing... Don't know if it's coincidence. Don't know if it's homage, or if it's something maybe Barks or when used when, you know, you mentioned in the original fan how Barks that back in the day. But I just thought it was very interesting to have that very similar name in a similar site type of the adventure comic that is the phantom. That's all about the the daring due and the rescuing and fighting the pirates and you will charge requested collectors I don't know You can I was just fan and never everyone after but of like, like there's.

263
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:53,245
Knows. I I think that's a good catch. I would I wouldn't be surprised, you know, the the fan was a super famous

264
00:24:53,985 --> 00:25:03,354
serial civilized strip. Right? And so I I would be shocked if Barks wasn't familiar with it. So I think that's a cool catch. So on the next page, the Inducks

265
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:06,328
are patching up their boat. They agree that Mc... Mc

266
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:07,566
has one

267
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:11,335
round one of their sperm here. And

268
00:25:11,915 --> 00:25:18,855
they managed to get the gut boat going again. Eventually, Donald is really thirsty, so he takes a big drink from his canteen.

269
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:33,606
And finds out that it has mud in it. The water has been doctor. And so they decide they need to check out their rash. So Donald throws a piece of hard attack to one of the crocodile dials that's near the boat. Eric, do you wanna tell us

270
00:25:34,062 --> 00:25:35,638
what happens to that crocodile?

271
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,690
All

272
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:40,945
rapport to saint Crocodile just wanna have a snack and then he ended up dying.

273
00:25:42,023 --> 00:25:45,400
Yeah. He dies pretty thoroughly. So

274
00:25:45,714 --> 00:25:48,865
Butterfly collecting is serious business.

275
00:25:49,304 --> 00:26:01,930
Top wrote. So I and, you know, I like that that pin. I don't... It's a little bit off putting the fact that, you know, they're just killing crocodile in this episode. In this comic, but I like the

276
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:07,422
crocodile eval death throws in those two panels that's spread it's pretty funny and printing art.

277
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:08,838
So the decks

278
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:15,073
journey down the river, they, you know, figured they have to live off the land. They get their water by mocking

279
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:24,178
a monkey and getting it to throw up coconut at them. And nice lever touch. Yeah. And then we transition to night. There's a really awesome

280
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:27,265
couple of silhouette panels of the Inducks in there boat.

281
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:30,928
One of these was adapted into the the cover

282
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:45,679
for the the issue, the reprint that I first read this one in I think is just a... Yeah, Really cool cover. I'll certainly have that up on the Facebook page. But they approach a camp fire. And when they get close, they see the silhouette of professor fin.

283
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:48,516
And, you know, he's already

284
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:54,884
sabotage them. So I guess it turn about is fair play, and they thoroughly

285
00:26:55,343 --> 00:26:59,998
wreck his campsite while he's sleeping. But as they're leaving donald trips

286
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:00,997
waking

287
00:27:01,456 --> 00:27:02,196
the figure,

288
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:06,439
And as he gets up, it is revealed that it is not

289
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:12,262
but it is a an unpleasant looking man with the German accent.

290
00:27:12,655 --> 00:27:18,295
Who claims to be a professor von Tulip from their University of Rotterdam dom.

291
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:29,745
So professor Von Tulip is looking at his reps boat and supplies a guest, and the Ducktales just feeling incredibly guilty

292
00:27:30,085 --> 00:27:37,277
and, you know, Donald points out, You know, your... Here's your gun. It isn't a hurt. This is a bad idea because the professor

293
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:42,831
turns the gun on them and common years their supplies and

294
00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:50,517
Eric, you wanna tell us what the Inducks find out as he paddle off. It was at mask. It was professor

295
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:51,615
yellow along.

296
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:52,728
Done.

297
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:55,597
Yeah. Professor Mc is

298
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:59,742
pretty prepared. He seems to have really thought about his nefarious.

299
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:00,914
So

300
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:09,485
the Inducks have lost around two, and they... In in the morning, they figure out there there's a couple of bad things. Right? They can't patch the boat.

301
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:17,071
And they're not on a Barks like they thought they were it's a it's a little island that is surrounded entirely by crocodile.

302
00:28:17,944 --> 00:28:19,361
So they they kinda brainstorm

303
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:20,876
what are their options

304
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:21,873
and

305
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:26,897
they land on another plan that involves killing another crocodile.

306
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:39,206
You know, you go with what you what they have is and the of Ducktales, it's true. They've got poisoned heart attack and they've got crocodile dials. So so they feed another crocodile dial and they use it skin

307
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:46,170
to disguise themselves to get away from the rest of them. And, you know, Eric, you didn't get to

308
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:51,950
join us in the mystery of the swamp episode, but I think you read that story.

309
00:28:52,485 --> 00:28:57,019
This this whole page, you know, the Ducktales d sizing is dinosaur as

310
00:28:57,478 --> 00:29:07,094
as the crocodile and the the sand Barks. This this I felt like it was kind of a callback to mystery of the swamp. Sure. So on the next page, the deduct,

311
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:14,225
you know, they see that they've got some easy grass land walking coming up ahead until they come to a very deep gu,

312
00:29:14,565 --> 00:29:21,659
and it's necessary to cross on a suspicious looking boulder. You wanna tell us about the boulder that folder

313
00:29:22,155 --> 00:29:23,032
is Al

314
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:24,225
stun.

315
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,065
Yes. So

316
00:29:27,485 --> 00:29:28,825
they start an elephant,

317
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:33,225
and this actually works out pretty well for them because the elephant

318
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:45,681
t off in the direction that they need to go. So they make some really great time. Well, maybe think about, Like I'll look Al through that. That's not. That's normal. That's good y'all. Yeah. It's true. I didn't think about that.

319
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,135
You know, these are... I I like these panels with the elephant.

320
00:29:50,709 --> 00:30:04,723
Start and running away. The backgrounds look really cool Al elephant itself looks neat. I like them a lot. Yeah. And then on to the next page, I think are some of the the very pretty panels with the elephant crossing the river with the duct still on on their back.

321
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:07,437
The duck grabbing, some bananas

322
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:09,925
to subs off of

323
00:30:10,303 --> 00:30:12,439
and eventually coming to

324
00:30:12,857 --> 00:30:14,953
near the W River. I

325
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:29,985
that Barks really enjoyed the elephant making him a key part in two parts of the story and really just like maybe that every kid turns are going, you know, writing on Barks from office. Hopefully, we're still than getting it dropping out. Sure.

326
00:30:30,324 --> 00:30:33,440
But, you know, include that the story so make it... That's like, oh, that's, you know,

327
00:30:34,174 --> 00:30:34,794
go right...

328
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:37,072
Yeah. It does look like he had fun

329
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:38,510
depicting the elephants.

330
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:42,565
Yeah. It's a good thing because by the end of it, he's gonna have to draw a lot of elephants.

331
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:47,354
Give us Barks that's was. Yeah. So still on this page, we

332
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,751
transitioned back to professor Mc.

333
00:30:50,504 --> 00:30:52,041
Who almost immediately

334
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:53,518
spots the almost

335
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:54,635
extinct,

336
00:30:55,172 --> 00:31:01,157
and as he's about to capture him donald pops up and trips him and intending to take his net.

337
00:31:01,535 --> 00:31:08,817
And on the next page, of course, Mc is shocked to see him. This is a a fun exchange. You know, he Barks

338
00:31:09,456 --> 00:31:16,676
how do you get here, Donald tells him I took the bus, and he says, well, you'll take the horseback back pulling out a gun

339
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:19,432
Fortunately, the nephew has a a nice

340
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:20,765
late forties

341
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:24,765
sling shot. Every every kidney needs have Al sling shot. And

342
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:33,250
peg him right in the eye winning round three as he says. So they managed to run off professor Mc

343
00:31:33,707 --> 00:31:38,289
who, you know, needs to plot and scheme, and he ponder...

344
00:31:38,865 --> 00:31:39,843
So in the version,

345
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:43,549
Eric that we're reading, he says, he thinks to himself

346
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,920
there must be a native village around here where I can hire some assistance.

347
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,960
Al see Donald about to catch the butterfly.

348
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:57,042
Eric, can I share with you my screen again so you can see

349
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,165
what that looks like on the original printing? I'm not scared to see. Yeah. This one's not great.

350
00:32:02,978 --> 00:32:03,478
Oh

351
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:04,533
Yeah. Yeah.

352
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:08,184
So again, we've got...

353
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:11,294
We've got the kind of african

354
00:32:11,672 --> 00:32:12,172
savage

355
00:32:12,524 --> 00:32:14,102
karat sure, but

356
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,816
but even more so, unfortunately.

357
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:21,300
Yeah. Alright. So on the next page, we see him

358
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,260
having encountered

359
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,035
the the narrator box says that Mc makes a deal with some very rough

360
00:32:29,735 --> 00:32:31,855
savages. That's the term that they uses.

361
00:32:32,455 --> 00:32:36,475
And he says in in the version you and I read it's... He says now you

362
00:32:36,935 --> 00:32:41,843
understand for two false teeth. Oh, no. And the version you and I read, he says you

363
00:32:42,182 --> 00:32:58,714
understand for two confederate dollars here to capture these little boys and hold them until I tell you to let them go. And and in the original, you said for two false teeth here to capture these fat juicy little boys and hold them until I tell you to let them go. And

364
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:06,508
I'm not gonna read what they say, but it's implied that there just decided at the prospect of eating them as cannibal animals.

365
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:11,496
And and if you look, if you compare Eric, it looks like there was some artwork

366
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:18,643
slipped in to kinda stretch this panel out Yeah. And totally excise that panel referencing

367
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:19,495
cannibalism.

368
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:27,385
Yeah. So the steaks are really high on this page. And we see... We transition back to the nephews,

369
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,540
who have...

370
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,500
While Donald is pursuing the butterfly,

371
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,540
they've gathered a big jar of caterpillars

372
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,930
that one of the nephews used would like to take home to their nature teacher.

373
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:44,758
While they're pondering how much they're looking forward to getting a home, we see them captured

374
00:33:45,415 --> 00:33:47,132
with Spears pointed to Al them.

375
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:49,588
Kind of standard...

376
00:33:49,966 --> 00:34:00,715
Yeah. Although, usually, they're the ones kinda getting out of it. And, you know, in this one, Barks hasn't really turned them into the junior wood checks that he would later. Right? That would that would

377
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:05,246
look up information about the place they're traveling to

378
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:09,921
and probably would not harm any of the the local wildlife.

379
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:10,580
No.

380
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:13,769
So meanwhile, Donald

381
00:34:14,306 --> 00:34:19,356
has been in pursuit of the butterfly for quite some time. This is a pretty cool series

382
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:22,922
how he gets the butterfly fly. The butterfly

383
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,472
flies nearly off of cliff, but it gets... It gets pushed backwards

384
00:34:28,104 --> 00:34:30,961
by an elephant trunk right into Donald snack.

385
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:43,440
So he when he looks down... Oh, I like the line that he says an elephant blew him back to me. That's two favors I owe them. And then he's shocked twenty sees in this gu, there's, like a gathering of thousands of elephants.

386
00:34:44,653 --> 00:34:52,199
So Donald just journeys back to his to his camp. And I don't think Elephants really do this. I don't think they gather these numbers. But

387
00:34:52,780 --> 00:35:07,575
it's it's a pretty cool image. Yeah. It's a wonderful product device. Yeah. So Donald gets back and he doesn't see the kids. And he realized to his horror that Mc must have them. So he goes to his camp and

388
00:35:07,994 --> 00:35:12,428
phoenix sure enough gl that he'll trouble him for that butterfly,

389
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:19,860
and he points out that they are over at that native village where there's some ominous drums in the background.

390
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:23,384
And so he explains that he's gonna trade the nephews

391
00:35:23,761 --> 00:35:24,779
for that butterfly.

392
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:26,732
So in the version,

393
00:35:27,347 --> 00:35:27,847
we

394
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:29,898
see. It references

395
00:35:30,277 --> 00:35:36,550
their heads being shrunk because I guess Voodoo head shrinking is considered a little less offensive.

396
00:35:37,363 --> 00:35:37,442
Well.

397
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:43,865
I think little more and say there's the head you could interpret that head of the village.

398
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:55,195
Or pet. I think that... That's that... That's a little more I'm not just verifying it, but I'm saying it more ambiguous. As opposed to. Right. I do think. There they are in a.

399
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:57,575
Yeah. Yep. There's the two pot.

400
00:35:58,788 --> 00:36:03,437
So, anyway, Donald has no choice but to give him the butterfly.

401
00:36:03,974 --> 00:36:10,724
And he gets the nephews back and They agree that the professor wins round four, and they're kinda doing

402
00:36:12,065 --> 00:36:12,565
just,

403
00:36:13,025 --> 00:36:19,525
fortunately not literally. And they're they're noting that the professor is gonna beat them to the coast, and then

404
00:36:19,862 --> 00:36:26,199
Donald has a realization after one of the nephews makes the joke about catching the ride on another elephant.

405
00:36:26,576 --> 00:36:27,435
Because that

406
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:31,959
reminds him of that convention of elephants. And on the next page,

407
00:36:32,378 --> 00:36:41,284
he shows them where the river benz ends deeply where there's the opening of that pass. So you tell the Nephews

408
00:36:41,704 --> 00:36:43,164
to light a bunch of fires

409
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:44,324
which

410
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:49,893
deeply alarms the smoke from the fires deeply alarms the elephants

411
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:50,890
who

412
00:36:51,228 --> 00:36:59,120
stampede peed and tear towards the gap where the river meets that big gu. And way to repair your favorite.

413
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:03,067
Yeah. Exactly. This is this is

414
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:04,399
another

415
00:37:04,737 --> 00:37:12,755
kind of example of the casual animal cruelty in this one because, like, they're not directly hurting these elephants, but I I'm sure a bunch of them are

416
00:37:13,294 --> 00:37:15,651
worse for the wear after the stamp.

417
00:37:16,211 --> 00:37:16,711
But

418
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:25,251
I can't argue with the fact that on the next page, we get one of the coolest panels that bark has gotten to do so far. Oh, yeah.

419
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:29,261
As this stampede of thunder elephants

420
00:37:29,654 --> 00:37:31,470
crashes is into professor Mc,

421
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:40,066
pad is boat across. It's a it's a great half page panel very detailed. Donald and the distance is saying all that for a butterfly.

422
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:41,625
And,

423
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:50,154
you know, mc fee gets patched up. The Ducktales patch him up at least. They rescue they rec recall and near the butterfly from him

424
00:37:50,454 --> 00:37:53,194
and head back with the butterfly and the jar of caterpillars.

425
00:37:53,709 --> 00:38:00,334
Any other thoughts on on that one. That's just that's such a cool panel. That that is... You know, you guys spoke paper panel on like that's

426
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:03,426
anybody who that could be the paper panel that is Al

427
00:38:04,104 --> 00:38:32,455
I I sometimes wonder when I see our like that economics is the someone wanna draw that picture and then had to come up with the story to go around that picture. So just for excuse to draw that picture because it's done with such detail and such such appreciation that's really the show stopper. Yeah. I agree. I had I had the same thought. And this is a pretty low resolution one that I'm showing you, but you can see the when he's gonna go back to this well and show a dinosaur stampede.

428
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:39,599
It's a pretty cool panel. It's not quite as need is the one Anything think. No. There's what we're actually going one, but it's good. Yeah. Yeah.

429
00:38:41,038 --> 00:38:49,257
And, again, that's for Forbidden Valley, and this that's like, ten years later, so we won't we won't do that for a pretty good span. But anyway, we

430
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:51,784
transition to the boat to to the docks

431
00:38:52,681 --> 00:39:09,960
on a return ship to the Us and the docs seem to have reached a bit of a detox with professor Mc because he's still sc at them, but they're not, like, actively trying to murder each other at least. But professor Mc find is just like despair that his life's purpose.

432
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:10,913
Is

433
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:35,085
done. He lost the butterfly that he was dreaming of finding and is is really down the dumps. So Donald tells the kids to go off and play he's gonna keep an eye on the old guy in case he tries something funny. And on the next page, this is where we get that like, suicide for comedic purpose where he says that he has nothing to live for, so he plans to jump into the ocean.

434
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:39,794
But Al he's about to jump in, he sees an almost a.

435
00:39:40,732 --> 00:39:48,637
And then looking around, he sees even more and more and he and Donald point out that... Wow. Now that Butterfly is

436
00:39:49,016 --> 00:39:50,235
basically worthless.

437
00:39:51,189 --> 00:40:00,734
And they wonder where it's coming from and then the nephews around the corner and revealed that their jar of butterflies turns out to have been a whole of almost

438
00:40:02,314 --> 00:40:02,814
and

439
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:08,589
how disappointed their teachers going to be. And that's the end of Darkest Africa.

440
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:11,189
Yeah. Not not the longest

441
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:12,389
of stories.

442
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:14,749
You know, this one I

443
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:23,155
I only had this one issue of it. So I I didn't I don't think I read this one too much as a kid. But I definitely

444
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:27,196
remember enjoying this one, more than I do

445
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:30,702
today. That's fair. And it's it's a good standard

446
00:40:31,294 --> 00:40:40,734
story, you know, they get put over whether the they're like a couple times, and then they have to use the resources and like all good adventure stories. You wouldn't by using a spare.

447
00:40:41,308 --> 00:41:03,083
You know, that and then end up putting a hand, but and end, it does become... You know, they're not the Shiny heroes. It's, like, oh, well, my victory victories more of a moral one because we didn't get we want it, but the bad guy heated. Right. Yeah. So so you enjoyed this one? I Al aspects of it. I thought I I I... The eventually part of the business is the elephants we're good, But I mean, yeah the lot of the depictions

448
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,901
even can in a boot versus, unit Gottfredson.

449
00:41:07,021 --> 00:41:08,397
Still questionable. And

450
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:11,165
for that reason, like, yeah, I'm not gonna just wanna a lot.

451
00:41:11,817 --> 00:41:19,110
Yeah. But I did like... I thought that the title was good because it's kind of dark story. It's all about revenge.

452
00:41:19,723 --> 00:41:21,738
And and ever talked about her revenge,

453
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:42,060
and it it's called Barks said, you know, Revenge this come through with our card. You could think about it. Yeah. That's true. It ends up being a very fitting title. Yeah. I mean, I'm torn on this one because, like, a lot of... A lot of that doesn't sit well with me obviously, but there's there a lot to enjoy about this one. There's some neat adventure.

454
00:41:42,719 --> 00:42:01,046
I do think some of the transitions and this one are a little bit jarring. Right? I think maybe it could've have stood to have been, like, two to four pages longer or something because, like, it's not just the fact that they get where they're going very quickly. It's just that things happen almost too quickly in this one. But

455
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:03,840
there's there's certainly some meet artwork

456
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:07,809
in this one It it didn't I wasn't as bothered

457
00:42:08,269 --> 00:42:08,769
by

458
00:42:09,229 --> 00:42:11,529
some of the, like, racial stereotypes

459
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:15,544
as I was in, like, Volcano Valley where

460
00:42:16,363 --> 00:42:20,100
where that's fair. Yeah. Where I think it was, like, more

461
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:48,310
important to the story. That's not to excuse these, you know? Oh no. Put together the those characters the the the native characters were very much a background of the story. Right. To a degree, not like, an kind of ballet where it was like, no their whole stereotype the the stereotype type that was pushing the story along know Right. You could've have, like, taken them out of the story and just kind of changed it a little bit without really affecting it that much.

462
00:42:49,124 --> 00:42:59,789
Because, like, most of the danger came from, like, the African wildlife and and the Ducktales fighting against Mc in this So, you know, again, that's not to excuse

463
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:00,609
it at all.

464
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:03,829
But but at least it wasn't, like the

465
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,324
we're not fundamental to the story.

466
00:43:07,103 --> 00:43:37,274
Yeah. So so this one this one's alright. This is kind of to me a middle bark story. The the general consensus you know, we like to look on the index page to see where the community has rated this one. And I'm finding Eric that a lot of these stories where there are these stereotypes that I might think would kind of pull down the rating. It isn't really pulled down. And I I assist fact that that's because index is pretty ancient

467
00:43:37,652 --> 00:43:44,914
as far as the Internet goes. You? So I'm pretty sure it's been around for I think since the nineties.

468
00:43:45,295 --> 00:43:50,529
That's original internet they're... Yeah. So, like, many of the votes are

469
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:53,809
from long enough ago that many people

470
00:43:54,390 --> 00:44:04,524
maybe are not taking these things into account. Or maybe they just don't care about it and they're just enjoying the story the way. They enjoyed it as a kid and that's that's fine.

471
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:23,464
Maybe they're going up the reprint and the original printing. Yeah. That's true. Again, I I think it's hard to avoid some of the bones of this story. But... But... Yeah. So so for index, this one has a seven point seven out of ten, which is good enough for one hundred and fifty second.

472
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,896
Out of all about forty one thousand

473
00:44:26,274 --> 00:44:27,472
Disney comics.

474
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:34,254
Placing it pretty high in the ninety nine percentile. As far as, like, relative to the other

475
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:40,959
stories we've read, That definitely places it in the upper half. Ty tied with stories like

476
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:52,494
chair of the River and Mah raja Donald. You know, I think this one is, I guess, well regarded by fans. It does have some pretty cool adventure and some pretty memorable

477
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:53,774
panels.

478
00:44:54,234 --> 00:45:05,722
I would say that these these this version of the docks they're a little less developed. Right? I think Huey, doing and Louie are gonna evolve a little bit as we go along. Yeah. I can turn that one. We we've already

479
00:45:06,154 --> 00:45:09,327
talked about what's dated or archaic in this one

480
00:45:09,744 --> 00:45:19,278
and what's retro grade? What's problematic, obviously, the the kind of overall view of Africans as as savages and just the term Barks Africa.

481
00:45:20,215 --> 00:45:22,604
So this one doesn't doesn't hold up

482
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:24,644
that well, but,

483
00:45:25,304 --> 00:45:28,304
you know, has some has some fun cool elements.

484
00:45:29,264 --> 00:45:43,118
And for I don't feel like there's a ton of educational value either in this one. No. There there could've been an opportunity to learn a little bit about butterflies. Only one of them was even a real one. You know, the the dog Latin is is kinda fun. But...

485
00:45:43,696 --> 00:45:49,124
But, you know, I I do really like it when I learned something. Cool from one of these Barks stories.

486
00:45:49,739 --> 00:46:04,043
We both... We kind of acknowledge that the elephant stampede is the clear winner for pants and this one. Were were there any other panels that came to mind for you. I don't like I like... I you put it out the one with the...

487
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:46,484
See the butterfly original through arrow in it. Putting it out. That was a really neat just Barks panel. And, of course, Barks is really well with anything with so last and to do some contrast for the color polarization and the cover was just very impressive to me. Yeah. And that was a rei imagining that he didn't do the cover that I showed to you, but it did... It did re... It was repurposed from his panels. So... Okay. Yeah. Because the original March of Come had, like, a totally unrelated cover. But I agree those silhouette ones are really cool. And you know, look kinda randomly, I really liked the sequence where Donald is pursuing the butterfly and that elephant trunk pops it into his net. It was kinda weird but it was neat. Yeah. Any...

488
00:46:46,941 --> 00:46:50,769
Oh, as as far as appearances, I don't wanna leave that out

489
00:46:51,586 --> 00:46:53,164
not really any appearances

490
00:46:53,502 --> 00:47:04,609
in any... He didn't use this one Al inspiration for an oil painting or lit graph. And as far as I know, this didn't really inspire any of the Ducktales episodes in either of the two series.

491
00:47:05,063 --> 00:47:09,170
Any any closing thoughts, any final thoughts for this one?

492
00:47:10,087 --> 00:47:25,131
No. I mean, it was it was a good standard of adventure story. It's a little different for me to donald or, you know, he's out for money or he's gets wrapped into something by accident or he I was need. Or his anger gets carried away. This one's is just about prevention

493
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,050
dongle.

494
00:47:26,389 --> 00:47:31,005
Don't kinda of hero this one, which is like in Al little bit different than a lot of the

495
00:47:31,318 --> 00:48:01,820
where Donald is the one who comes up with Al plan. Even if he doesn't find a better front but fighting end, for mean, he he had out and have the building. His own his own thinking. And is alvin planning, not by accident or the netflix is pulling his standing on the fire. And you know, I had cherokee characterize tim's as being kinda rubbish in the beginning, and he definitely... He definitely was, but you're right. He's he he is the resourceful one. Too much of this one. And he does end up being very heroic by the end, you know, savings nephews and even taking care of,

496
00:48:02,737 --> 00:48:08,129
you know, patching them and trying and to stop him from killing himself. Yeah. So

497
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:14,411
that's at least some somewhat of Al art for him. Excellent. Well, Eric, I really appreciate you

498
00:48:14,947 --> 00:48:19,328
joining us again coming back. Yeah. No problem. I hope

499
00:48:19,987 --> 00:48:27,959
everyone will join us next time when we get to talk about a a very famous and very well regarded

500
00:48:28,393 --> 00:48:30,731
story, the old castle secret.

501
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,929
Yeah. Should be a good one. This is...

502
00:48:33,308 --> 00:48:38,138
I I like to say, Eric, but this is the true origin story. For.

503
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:45,955
