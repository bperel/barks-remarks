Hello, and welcome back to Barks remarks I'm Mark Sever. A grown man who enjoys du comics and who

4
00:00:56,505 --> 00:01:01,047
still doesn't have an intro that he's totally happy with. But what are you gonna do?

5
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:05,948
I am here with a new guest c.

6
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:07,797
And we're gonna be talking

7
00:01:08,214 --> 00:01:13,240
today about a very fun story. We're gonna be going over Barks

8
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:22,435
serpent tail, no such var. But first, let me have my guest introduce himself. Hi. I'm Austin and Kelly.

9
00:01:23,268 --> 00:01:31,664
It's not much interesting about me. I guess I'm just like you and and everyone listening. I mean, I'm a big Barks fan. And you know, I've been talking to a mark for a while

10
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:55,395
about Barks comics, disney comics in general, and I'm very happy to be here to talk about you know, a very cool, very fun Barks story. Excellent. Yeah. Thanks for thanks for being here. It's it's one of the neat things about doing this project is that I'm finally getting to meet people who really enjoy these comics. So so it is fun. When people reach out. And I know that you've got your own

11
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:58,155
interests in in other non

12
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,130
comics and cartoons.

13
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:11,113
Right? Do you wanna give a quick plug to what you do? Sure. So for while I collaborated with Anthony Coat on his great Anthony's animation talk channel on Youtube,

14
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:16,997
We were doing a lot of stuff during the pandemic. Common live commentary over, great one of brothers cartoons

15
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:18,607
I was doing a series

16
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:20,922
called the magic of freeze framing highlighting

17
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:23,814
some of the great warner animators and their work.

18
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:25,791
But as the pandemic

19
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:41,814
sort of cool down. I sort of got busier and I haven't done a lot with Anthony in a while, but, you know, I've done dozens and dozens of videos and you can find them all up on his channel, and Anthony animation talk, And, you know, beyond that, that's pretty much it, but that was all very fun. And this is sort of the first comics related podcast,

20
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:51,320
video, any sort of thing I've, you know, ever really done. So this is Al like a new experience, but also sort of something that I'm familiar with at the same time. Excellent. Yeah. Some of that

21
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:52,916
classic loo

22
00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:26,540
stuff. From about this same era is just wildly entertaining and and beautiful to watch. Oh, yeah. So Austin, you, you are pretty familiar with this issue with no such pharma. Mh. I... It's actually one of the first four colors I ever read that I had Barks embark adventure in it. So I read it a few times and you know, it's not the greatest Barks story, but that's only comparing it to his absolute masterpieces. It's a it's a great, you know, fun adventure. Yeah. I I'd agree. This is this is a lot of fun. This is

23
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:34,915
probably pretty mid considering it's in is what most people would call his golden age. But it is. It's it's a good time and and you have the fourth color.

24
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:37,875
Yeah. I collect the original dell books

25
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:49,841
so I have the original copy and a lot of other original copies for a lot of the original printing of the great Barks stories. So that's all fun. Nice. So we should you you mentioned that it was a dell

26
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,527
publication here in the Us. So let's let's talk about this actual

27
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:59,716
original issue. Oh, yeah. So I think this was originally published

28
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:04,114
you can correct me if I'm wrong, but there's... I think four color three eighteen,

29
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:25,040
so it was a one shot in a series of, you know, this this line of books that Dell would use for characters that, you know, they didn't think we're good enough for their own title yet. Put out in nineteen fifty one and usually Barks with your Al cover for the story. But the comma for this book was actually done by someone named. I don't know if I'm pronouncing is properly. Carl B,

30
00:04:25,374 --> 00:04:28,826
something like that. He did a lot of great work with the ducks.

31
00:04:29,363 --> 00:05:01,504
The big bad wolf and the other disney titles that Dell was doing. So Yeah. I I think it's Carl B. That's how I've always pronounced it in my mind. Although I realized now that I've never heard it said out loud. He was kinda the western like, in house artist. And yeah, You're right. He did this cover. He he got to do a lot of Barks covers for a while until they finally gave it to him for old Castle secret. It is nineteen fifty one, early fifty one, January is the publication date, and I I talk austin and usually about how many

32
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:03,824
reprint these have.

33
00:05:04,364 --> 00:05:08,624
This one has kind of the average number in the Us. It's good for eight

34
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:40,365
printing counting this one. But I noticed something pretty interesting about one of the reprint. For this one. I don't know if you encountered this at all, but this is something that I learned about. And you heard of the Dino bright comments by chance Mh. The the late seventies Whitman line. Yeah. Have you ever seen one of those? Well, I buy a lot of the, like, the old dell Barks. So I actually see those like, i ton around. They're not, you know, particularly of interest to me. But I know that that printing

35
00:05:41,105 --> 00:06:06,748
when they reprinted no such Barks, there's a covered that's the same one that B, you know, B whatever you wanna pronounce name as did, but it's sort of like traced over. It's sort of like a red wrong, I think. Right. So when I think of Whitman, there was kind of a dark era for the American Disney comics. There's a lot of... I would call junk stories. They were still doing a lot of the re reprint. The color was pretty ga that, like, late seventies.

36
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:16,476
They they really clogged the back issue bins. And I mean, this one still looks kind of ga, but I think the idea is that it was supposed to be much more premium.

37
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:19,249
Right? It had, like a a much nicer

38
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,220
cover I gather more like cardstock

39
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,820
with some gloss or pages

40
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:40,581
inside and it would be a lot longer. I think this one, they didn't do very many of these and about half of them were Disney comics. I think there were only like one to two dozen of them released though in, like nineteen seventy eight. So I I thought that was kinda neat. I I also

41
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:46,900
researching this, I I learned from reading my glad back issue that apparently Barks

42
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:52,517
had to kind of evade a dictate that Western Publishing had against

43
00:06:52,854 --> 00:06:55,205
showing snakes in their comics.

44
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:58,114
And and that just cracked me up. The

45
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:01,147
letter or the the little paragraph basically

46
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:28,731
implied that the only way he got around it was that his snakes were just like so so dang cute looking that they didn't really trip the sensors. Yeah. Well, that actually is pretty interesting. I know in the mid fifties around around fifty five Dell crackdown on a lot of that stuff and they had they, you know, had a strict set of rules that know, their artist and writers had to follow. That affected Barks, it affected everyone that we're working with. But they didn't really strictly follow that stuff

47
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:35,180
before that point, but I guess the snake thing does sort of make sense. Yeah. Any any

48
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:47,400
interesting trivia or anything you came across that you wanna share at this point. I think there's something interesting is like, c serpents come up a lot in Barks work. I mean, not a whole ton, but

49
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:59,190
some like, somewhat often. This is the second of five times that he used, like a serpent creature like coming out of, like, a body of water. There was the famous terror of the river. Is this one,

50
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:03,465
there's a later day... Latter day ten page or called mystery of the log.

51
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:06,494
A gold key ten pager called Instant Hercules,

52
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:45,171
and then something that he only wrote didn't draw for gold key called a B lee of Lake Erie the junior wood shocks that was done in the early seventies. So... And and there's also... There was a cool... A bunch of cool covers done for this one. Probably most notably, the the Don rosa one. You showed merely on your Donald like adventures reprint. Yeah. I... I'm a big fan of that that rose one. I think it's a great attention get. I think I think you're right. I think it's fair to say that it's a lot of sea serpent. When you when you consider that I I remember I talked about this when I did the episode on terror of the river. It seems weird to me like c serpents are kind of a famous

53
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:50,891
you know, arch monster. And yet there's not a ton of like, pop culture famous

54
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:56,788
representations of that. Like Barks has his and, you know, he's not, like, super famous.

55
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:59,721
But you got the lock ness monster

56
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:10,962
but it gets pretty obscure pretty quick if you if you're really struggling. You're a fan of the old cartoons, Maybe you know Bin and Ce. Oh, yeah. Totally. Then that's an interesting one.

57
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:20,456
So you still the c six c serpent. But Yeah. Barks like sea serpents obviously. Because this was just five years

58
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,470
after terror of the river.

59
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:23,489
And

60
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:31,053
I... It's hard to, like, kind of escape the fact that the the creature design is very, very similar

61
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:33,110
for for the two of them. Mh.

62
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:52,862
Yeah. It's interesting in my mind, a terror of the river and no such var. When I was, like a very casual Barks fan. Like, they sort of blended together in my mind because his four color adventures with Donald from the forties have this all very unique flavor to them and, you know, in the mommy's he's ring you've got you know, this this mommy, you know,

63
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:56,858
in frozen gold, you've got this very distinct, like, art setting.

64
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:42,259
But like the c serpent that sort of serves as the major plot point in this one and tear the river. Like, they they kinda blend together in the minds in a way. Yeah. I agree. They they look so similar. But there's, like, a big difference in that. This one is so it's really goofy when it comes down to it. Mh. And of course and, of course, you know, spoiler, it is real. So anything else you wanted to share before I transition into our our titles from around the world. That should be it. I I do think it's cool looking on, like Ducktales and then seeing all the covers that have been done for this one around the world, you know, throughout, you know, the past seventy years whatever. So I would suggest the viewer to, you know, go on and check those out. Those pretty cool. Yeah. Absolutely, man. I'll I'll make sure to

65
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:55,227
share him on on the facebook a page as well. Yeah. I I definitely have some other stuff I wanna talk about, but I don't like to drag out the intro too long, because Boy, there's a lot to say about, like, snake charming and and some other

66
00:10:55,966 --> 00:11:01,354
interesting subjects for this. But I I do like to pan Austin to my

67
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:05,904
international audience. And I imagine they get a kick out of me butchering

68
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,577
titles in different languages.

69
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:16,045
So I've I've given you a couple, and I've got a couple here. Why don't I start us off with

70
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:19,214
French? So in French, this one's called

71
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:25,429
So that's pretty straightforward, Donald Charms the

72
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:29,469
serpent of the c. That's that's actually a pretty cool one.

73
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:37,124
In Germany, they call this one and this is like like a crazy word I don't know if I'm gonna pronounce it right, but like, they call it

74
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:38,324
sc

75
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:40,044
well

76
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:45,939
or something like that, which roughly translates just a snake charm, which is, I guess, fairly straightforward.

77
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,539
Yep. Yep. It's one of those

78
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:49,699
big German

79
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:51,079
combined nouns.

80
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:54,232
Let's see. And then I'm gonna do

81
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,706
Norway and in Norwegian. It's no Ducktales

82
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:01,578
c... Okay. Donald Ducktales,

83
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:08,271
which is Donald Duck and the c worm. Got it... I gotta assume that's worm kinda like w

84
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:14,124
r m. Think a Norse word for Dragon or something. That's a cool one And then in Italy,

85
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:15,804
they call this one

86
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:18,737
of pent

87
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:19,613
dim

88
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:24,884
which is donald and the snake charm, which is you know, fairly bland, but

89
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:33,909
more descriptive than the German one, I guess. Yeah. And you know what? I am gonna throw in one other because I realized there is a weird one. In Spain, this was

90
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:39,727
and Donald has a flute, kind of kind random.

91
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:40,843
So

92
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:48,405
as we transition into discussing the the kind of story Arc here austin, I'm always kind of thinking

93
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:57,734
with these stories about what is the iteration, the the type that Donald and the Nephews are. Right? Because he he famously

94
00:12:58,114 --> 00:13:03,894
makes Donald in every man. So, you know, sometimes his appearance is her heroic, sometimes it's coward

95
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:09,663
that's something that I like to think about. So I'm gonna kick it off by

96
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:23,359
talking about page one and the set up for no such var. This is really interesting to me. It's a neat little book end. Right? I guess, before we get to the book, we have this really quick drawing in the reader to a

97
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:27,419
a ship rack. There's a ship out at c and Barks

98
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:30,652
introduces it as being very mysterious.

99
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,370
Right? One of

100
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:34,328
sc Mc ships

101
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:44,139
that is full of gold from his last minds strikes a mysterious object and sinks And in just two panels, we've got the

102
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:45,791
crew escaping

103
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:54,264
and just kind of puzzling over how mysterious that is. And then we quickly trans addition to Duck where we've got the Nephews

104
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,898
and they are just pondering

105
00:13:57,396 --> 00:14:05,559
sort of the the greatness of men. And how some men are great and some men are bumps.

106
00:14:06,318 --> 00:14:08,536
And this is this is a really interesting

107
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:10,909
characterization I think of the nephews

108
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,706
because they're not usually

109
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,984
so like, high minded.

110
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:21,994
But but this is the story that Barb wants to tell. And so they're they're pointing out these

111
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:36,800
different great men who all happen to be walking by and they point them out by name and they point them out by eye q occupation, and they're all very, like, clever puns on their names. They they list off flynn hide, the banker,

112
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:38,811
who's rich and successful,

113
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:40,887
shy the lawyer,

114
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:43,042
famous for his wit or.

115
00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:48,404
Go ahead on the next page Austin. Oh, yeah. On the next page, we have

116
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:50,958
grown bombs, the great doctor,

117
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:53,671
Barks up a millionaire merchant

118
00:14:54,144 --> 00:15:00,297
This is a good one scribble the great writer. This one actually might be like one of my favorite Barks names ever.

119
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:02,755
Trial n error

120
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:08,797
the mighty chemist who walks by in crutches and, like, multiple bandages over his face.

121
00:15:09,214 --> 00:15:13,724
Yeah. I really like this little opener. This this really

122
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:53,658
is memorable to me this, like, parade of great men. This this was one of the things I hadn't read this in well over a decade, and I remembered this vividly. Yeah. It's a it's a really nice opening And I have to say I i I think what's cool about Barks is work is that a lot of the characters aren't really portrayed is just, you know, like, dumb animals as a lot of people kinda made them. But I think there's like a real, like, bit of human nature and the fact that just randomly one day like, these nephews are just sitting around and thinking like, you know, there's so many great men and our uncle uncles a total failure. I think like random spurt of, like, that sort of thinking,

123
00:15:54,116 --> 00:16:12,145
really reflects, like, how, like, you and I would think, Like someday, we would... You know, almost like a midlife crisis where you kind of get up and you're like you know, what do I amount to? Right. So go ahead and tell us about the contrast with the the great man on the rest of this page. Oh, yeah. This this great bit.

124
00:16:12,823 --> 00:16:18,672
Donald shows up with a basket and a flute hand and one of the nephews goes and there comes

125
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,040
donald and they all turn

126
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:34,740
sad and grim, and they're all sitting on this brick wall. And Donald, you know, coming along, he's very happy and I've finding interesting because he's rarely this displeased and just immediately happy in the Barks stories. And in the ten pager

127
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:40,314
you know and he's got some sort of new profession. He's got this sort of optimism and positive

128
00:16:40,694 --> 00:17:07,674
look to his like, new job, but you know, that all is shot down very quickly. But he starts out like, very happy here. So he's just walking along and his nephews he's just attack Al Donald, Aren't you ashamed your yourself. And what I really like is is the next panel is him just going... What have I done now? Like, he knows? They're just getting him for some, you know, something. Right. And I I think that's a great point. You know, we don't usually get to see him this, like, content

129
00:17:08,254 --> 00:17:14,645
that on that next page, you know, they're just... They're roasting him basically for not amount to much.

130
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:24,613
And they're they're conveying to us that they they feel ashamed of him. And and this is pretty striking. Right? Because, like, the nephews not usually,

131
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:30,836
like I said, they're not usually this sort of like status conscious, I would say. And

132
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,162
they're they're really feeling

133
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:34,654
ashamed of their uncle.

134
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:38,040
It's also interesting that we don't usually get to, like,

135
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:39,593
talk overt

136
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:55,342
about his success. Right? I think it's just kind of a given that he's kind of a general failure. He has another job every week. But they don't usually like, highlight that fact. Like, what what should we tell our classmates? What do we tell our teacher

137
00:17:55,721 --> 00:18:06,296
that you do? And and so by the end of this page, he's setting them up that he's saying finally found something that he can do really well. As

138
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:14,522
great. And then the next page, he shows up and he know go be seated gentlemen and I'll show he's all being very classy. And and nephew you start re,

139
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:17,412
he's got dignity. He's gonna be a great musician.

140
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:26,215
So he sets up and Donald just ends up being a snake charm. He plays a little something on his flute and the snake pops out of the basket,

141
00:18:26,594 --> 00:18:28,532
and the nephews are immediately

142
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,830
ashamed.

143
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:32,744
Which I find interesting because,

144
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:46,732
you know, if we're supposed to assume that, like, everything that's happening in Barks stories before this one, is like something that happened in the past and this, like, individual universe. Like, you would think the nephews user are happy get Donald finally

145
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:57,729
grasp onto something, he can do well after so many failures is, you know, so many so many different occupations that, you know, he's taken up in the past. And I find there, like,

146
00:18:59,049 --> 00:18:59,549
dissatisfaction

147
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,329
very, like, odd and out of character.

148
00:19:02,904 --> 00:19:13,661
Right, especially since they're usually that sort of little boy mold of of thinking creepy crawl stuff is cool. But But again, this is the story that Barks wants to tell.

149
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:14,719
Austin,

150
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:30,561
do you like the ten pager that are they've been called before like, the brittle mastery of Donald Duck where he he masters an occupation and then it goes horribly wrong. Oh, yeah. Those they're good. I think the later ones can get a little,

151
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:42,507
you know, you get a little deja vu with them, especially if you, you know, red a lot of Barks work. But I think the ones done up to this point and fifty one, we're really good. The one that sticks out in my mind is

152
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:50,190
I think it's from nineteen forty eight. I don't know what people call it because, you know, these were all the ten are.

153
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:58,344
It's called wired where he's up against the Nephews uses as a telegram boy. I always thought that one was great. Yeah. I remember that vaguely.

154
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:07,235
I tend to love those stories. Like you said the earlier ones. It's interesting that this is almost like a an adventure length version of those.

155
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:13,368
I I love the snake so much. This this little snake that he says, you know,

156
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:20,549
don't don't smear at me this outfit, including the snake cost five bucks. I'll have, you know, and the snake looks all hot.

157
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:26,289
It's hilarious to me. It's one of my favorite parts of the story. And so on the next page,

158
00:20:26,744 --> 00:20:30,993
you know, the nephews are despair that he's just gonna be a snake charm.

159
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,517
And he wants to prove himself you know, that he can't... He can do more than just

160
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:39,554
charm this train snake out of a basket.

161
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:41,392
And so he

162
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:44,722
he goes ahead and charms a bunch of wild snakes.

163
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:51,475
And again, it's it's very funny. They look weirdly adorable for snakes and the nephews are just totally revolt.

164
00:20:52,049 --> 00:21:00,950
Yeah. I I think this is like all very appealing. I mean, like we said, he's Donald never really just this fully satisfied in any

165
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:11,328
point in any Barks story. So I really like the image in the bottom right where he's just kind of happily going along with the state the the snakes. So anyway, on on the next page,

166
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:20,168
we have, you know, him trying to sneak some more, and the nephews walk away and and, you know, discussed and whatever. And they find

167
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:37,692
newspaper with the want ads open. And they pick it up and they read the ad let professor and make dome, read your dome. He can tell you what you're good for. So they rush to get donald there so they can find out, you know, what he can finally do with him self. And I have to say I I like

168
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:42,166
having the nephews pick up the newspaper and the reader being able to see

169
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,896
the headline about Sp

170
00:21:45,513 --> 00:22:00,445
sunk gold chip, you know, kind of tying it all back to, like, don't forget that bit at the beginning because we're about to go deeper into that in a few pages. I kinda like how Barks subtly does that there. Yeah. I agree. That wasn't... That was a nice little nudge.

171
00:22:01,398 --> 00:22:09,571
And and this was such a a classic, like, plot device having someone spot something on a newspaper, which just feels hopeless outdated now.

172
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:18,935
So on the next page, we get this this experience in Mcdonald's office in this doctor or this professors office.

173
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:21,849
And, you know, the way they talk about

174
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:29,579
how he can tell what what someone should be by the feel of their head, it just instantly made me think of,

175
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:38,049
you know, the like debunked science where someone is supposed to be able to feel the contour and the shape of someone's head and

176
00:22:38,386 --> 00:22:43,353
and know about their characters. So this is this is some great, like, quack

177
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,782
that that you kinda saw a lot in this era of storytelling.

178
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:54,329
And and the idea here is that the professor is gonna attach all these sensors and it's gonna display a number on

179
00:22:55,027 --> 00:22:55,527
screen,

180
00:22:55,905 --> 00:23:07,906
which corresponds to something that he's gonna look up in his book. And we get this great Barks gag where the professor adjusts his glasses, and he misses a little fly that lands on

181
00:23:08,284 --> 00:23:11,057
the the number one hundred and fifteen

182
00:23:11,728 --> 00:23:20,922
and appears to be a decimal point. And as I recall, this was a plot point in one of those brittle mastery

183
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:23,614
stories. The one where he was

184
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:30,944
the master wreck. There was, like a a little bug that totally messed him up by posing as

185
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:33,814
a decimal in a in an address or something.

186
00:23:34,191 --> 00:23:37,101
So one of those elements he uses multiple times.

187
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:40,087
Interesting. Yeah. The master

188
00:23:40,424 --> 00:23:55,002
one... Is that a... Like, is that a sixties ten pager? I think that's a way i I think it's definitely a later one. I think it's one of the better later ones. This the one with the wrecking ball where he's like an artistic building demolish.

189
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:57,296
Yeah. I've it's haven't things.

190
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:13,015
I I definitely wanna check that out. It's it's fantastic. It's a great one. Is a nice one. I do wanna bring up one thing before I move on to the next page. I I like the way Barks structures is stories, but I think just the convenience of the fly

191
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:17,575
landing on the the one hundred and fifteen is sort of like, oh,

192
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:30,933
lucky the fly was there that very moment. Like, almost a cool coincidence of sorts. I mean, he would take it's, like more of an extreme level and, like, I think the ending of the gil man comes to mind, that's it's sort of, like a weird one where it's like,

193
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:46,021
you know, how's... I I can't remember how that story goes, but, like, oh, how's Donald gonna, you know, get the money for this stamp that, you know, he just, like, traveled around the world for. There's a lot of that in the stories that have glad stone, right? A lot of a lot of massive coincidence.

194
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:54,856
Mh. But yeah. I forgot about those. Those are those are pretty good though. I think. I just like... I'm always like Glad Al a character especially.

195
00:24:55,392 --> 00:24:58,620
I think he works great in, you know, the short ten pages.

196
00:24:59,993 --> 00:25:02,370
On to the to the next page

197
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:06,585
where the professor looks up what eleven point five means.

198
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,490
And apparently means that Donald is this great detective. And

199
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:12,648
the nephews

200
00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:24,299
immediately start re and and donald, you know, walking away and discussed. And what I find. Interesting is, like, I I feel like nephew is this point have been characterized is almost like, these

201
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:26,615
mature adult figures.

202
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:29,147
I feel like they should know at this point.

203
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:37,297
Knowing Donald, he's not gonna be able to latch onto any sort of profession no matter how easy are hard like right away.

204
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:40,547
But anyway, they walk away into the park and

205
00:25:41,018 --> 00:25:55,957
you know, They asked donald what they're gonna do. You know, what you gonna do now? Are you're gonna rent an office? Start solving mysteries and then he just pulls down his flu it goes back to charming snakes, which I find really funny he he walks off into the distance. Yeah. I I really like that image of him.

206
00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:01,583
You know, stubborn pulling the the little flute out. That's a great that's a great visual.

207
00:26:02,382 --> 00:26:04,960
So we we transition now to

208
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:12,605
sc mc dot. And this is a pretty neat view of his office. You know, we're we're still transitioning into, like, Barks.

209
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,636
Figuring out how much he likes this character.

210
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:19,910
And kind of what are the rules of his his richness

211
00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:21,084
And

212
00:26:21,741 --> 00:26:25,154
at this point, he's got the huge vault behind him.

213
00:26:25,532 --> 00:26:42,874
He's still in an office. We don't have a bin yet. I don't believe. But the office is just completely flooded with money. His his secretary is walking through it waiting through it. As he tells him about the the disappearance of the ship that the reader already knows about.

214
00:26:43,314 --> 00:26:43,814
And

215
00:26:44,114 --> 00:26:50,380
Sc is just, you know, demanding results he wants the secretary to hire the world's greatest

216
00:26:50,718 --> 00:26:51,218
detective.

217
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:57,384
So very conveniently, the secretary is and find the want to add that the boys have

218
00:26:57,964 --> 00:26:59,984
have put up in, you know, hyper

219
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:06,130
referring to Donald as the best detective in the world. And they've got the very cute, like,

220
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:08,546
kid setup

221
00:27:08,924 --> 00:27:10,022
detective agency

222
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:18,330
that you know, you've seen in things like encyclopedia Brown and other kids books for years. And and they answer the phone and they

223
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:19,286
they

224
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:37,347
accept the job. Yeah. It's interesting. I I like this little detective setup, but, you know, I just mentioned how I I feel like q doing that we were supposed to be sort of like, mature and then smarter than even like the average all way. I like to think they could spell detective properly.

225
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:39,076
Al it

226
00:27:39,414 --> 00:27:54,304
d e t e c k t i f on the sign here. But I I still think it's it's kind of funny how Barks through that in. I I I know what you mean. There's a little bit of whiplash there. Right? Because they've got this, like, really principled

227
00:27:54,978 --> 00:27:59,107
sn attitude and then they're like, super excited and a detective,

228
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:04,224
which a kid would probably get excited about. And Al adult would probably know that

229
00:28:05,002 --> 00:28:09,491
detectives are usually not talked about the same way that, like, judges

230
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:11,166
or bankers.

231
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:18,997
Are they're, you know, they're usually kind of on the outs. Definitely. I definitely agree with that. But anyway, on the next page, the Nephews

232
00:28:19,893 --> 00:28:27,895
get all excited to just got the call and and, you know, they've got a mystery lineup up for Donald, then we cut back to Donald charming snakes in the park as he is.

233
00:28:28,469 --> 00:28:31,009
And he's yelling at this tiny snake for

234
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:53,457
not being in step with whatever Marge donald on flee. And as he's yelling in the middle of yelling and nephew show up and start, you know, getting all excited about the detective job they found. And all the meanwhile, Donald to totally tuned down and he's just staring down like this tiny snake. Go go ahead and finish the the sequence onto the next page.

235
00:28:54,732 --> 00:29:12,614
And, you know, they fit... The nephew finished talking and and Donald hasn't been listening a bit and he goes. I just figured out why that little snake never keeps in step with the others. He's nothing put a dog on to worm. I which I I kinda of find funny. I also have to say, I really, like the face Donald pools when he's

236
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:15,705
nothing but a dog on worm. I like that drawing.

237
00:29:16,263 --> 00:29:23,479
I I love this sequence. I... This is one of my favorite parts. The... He's got the snakes like marching and formation

238
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:26,073
with the little worm looking all sheep.

239
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:31,661
And it's... They all they look so hilarious to me. It's it's such a ridiculous

240
00:29:32,014 --> 00:29:34,632
this is like a this is a super high concept

241
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:44,295
story. Right? This is all about this is the snake charming story that he wanted to tell. And he really is milk it here. You know? What kind of, like,

242
00:29:45,094 --> 00:29:49,450
ridiculous funny things can I do with snake charming?

243
00:29:49,944 --> 00:30:12,134
I I love it. This part totally works for me. So so we transition just really quickly. But I like the b transition sometimes we're in barn Bay where the ship went down. We get this really cool half page panel of the scenery. It's very clearly like the Pacific Northwest somewhere probably between, you know, Oregon and Al alaska

244
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:19,605
somewhere on the Pacific coast there. It's it's just it's it's great art. It's definitely a contender for one of the best panels in this story.

245
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:24,154
It's funny you say between Oregon Alaska is in my mind, I was

246
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:26,269
saying this feels like something

247
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:30,057
between oregon and Alaska. So I I kind of find that funny.

248
00:30:30,514 --> 00:30:33,659
You know, Barks was reading a lot of national geographic. So

249
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:38,788
Yeah. Probably thinking back to that when he was drawing that really cool panel at the bottom.

250
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:46,323
And and love the Pacific northwest, you know, we've got quite a few stories already at this point set there. Mh.

251
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,548
So you know, we're in B Bay and, you know, Donald

252
00:30:51,339 --> 00:31:15,866
in the back and he's got flu hand. He's he's sort of looking out and looking away. And and the nephew already, you know, hard on the case and they're thinking about, you know, where the boat could have sunk or, you know, what happened to the boat. And then they realized that, you know, they've gone all this way into, you know, possibly discovering what happened and donald just totally disappeared. And then they find them in the back, just charming this really nice looking

253
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:23,105
pair of snakes. I really like this this character of of the, you know, the nephews already being like well underway with the mystery

254
00:31:23,563 --> 00:31:35,641
and Donald just being in the back goof off. I find that really funny. Yeah. I agree. And and this is the dynamic that we're gonna get for most of the rest of the story. Right? The Nephews are gonna be focused

255
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:44,855
on solving the case and and trying to nudge Donald to approving his worth as a great detective. And Donald is is never gonna really

256
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:49,505
break his character for this issue of just being dedicated

257
00:31:50,004 --> 00:31:59,140
to being a great snake charm. And so on the next page they're kinda checking out their supplies, they're figuring out, you know, that they seem to be pretty well provisioned

258
00:31:59,636 --> 00:32:04,897
of note they have a glass bottom boat for looking for looking for clues

259
00:32:05,636 --> 00:32:07,374
underwater, which I thought was pretty neat.

260
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,052
Radio to

261
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:14,018
to get support. And then we get this neat little bit where Donald

262
00:32:15,114 --> 00:32:23,363
says that, you know, he needs to send us a fresh box of apples because this one has worms in it. And he... He charms them

263
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,761
all out of the apples and and we we see all these worms doing this little w

264
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:30,800
dance.

265
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:34,695
And and I like the loose snake charming rules.

266
00:32:35,228 --> 00:32:53,739
Austin that that Barks has set up here that basically Donald charm anything that is snake shaped. Yeah. That's funny. I I was about to say like, I I kinda find interesting that... He's a snake charm, but he's also a worm charm because I guess, worms will look like tiny snakes.

267
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:54,819
Right.

268
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:13,879
Right. So they they go out to the bay to look for some clues and and, you know, Donald kinda silence them because he's getting inspiration. So, you know, they're out in the sea and then, you know, he's he's, like, you know, shu to the nephews because he's thinking and they all get excited.

269
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:17,574
And Donald, you know, has a spurt of genius seemingly and

270
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:32,208
You know, he pulls out his flu and he just starts playing and he goes a way to be a way to play Be and snake rhythm. And we, you know, just starts blowing off these notes and there's some nice, you know, expressions of the nephews just sitting there utterly disgusted.

271
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:49,349
So they're going along and they find a dent in the water, you know, they're looking through from the, you know, glass bottom boat. And they say it looks just as if a giant hand had picked up the ship and carried it away. Which is, you know, obviously weird because you can't just pick this thing up like it was a piece of paper.

272
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:59,816
And all the meanwhile tonal, this is still in the corner and and playing away on that flute. Right. Yeah. It's it's very ominous little panel where you see, you know, the disappeared

273
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:01,508
ship where it rested.

274
00:34:03,245 --> 00:34:08,433
So so on the next page, this this is a great page. This is This is the serpents

275
00:34:08,971 --> 00:34:12,703
reveal. This is what we've been waiting for since we saw one of the covers.

276
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:16,096
And and Donald is again getting inspiration

277
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:19,420
and he starts to practice a number

278
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:26,849
that is designed for charming big snakes. And we see a little quest and Barks rising from the depths.

279
00:34:27,306 --> 00:34:29,521
And then the the absolutely

280
00:34:30,617 --> 00:34:31,117
massive

281
00:34:31,788 --> 00:34:32,288
serpent

282
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:33,405
appears.

283
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,717
Just looking kinda curiously

284
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:39,067
at the docs who who are, of course terrified.

285
00:34:39,523 --> 00:34:42,374
And austin i I think that Barks

286
00:34:43,134 --> 00:34:46,894
serpent designs. May maybe it's maybe it's because I love sea serpents.

287
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:50,967
But I I just I love the designs of his two big

288
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:53,521
adventure c serpents here. The

289
00:34:54,019 --> 00:35:04,244
terror of the river fake serpent and and this real one. I think they're I just think they're great. Yeah. This... I mean, this one in particular, this is a great panel.

290
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:06,285
I I really do like also

291
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:31,792
and and not only Barks stories, but in general just like dell comics Al the time, there would usually be, like, a lot more for foreshadowing, like preceding the serpents appearance, you would see something like, you know, maybe, like, Al like a footprint or something or like, something that the serpent had left behind or they would be left thinking like, oh, what what could have left that? But I do like that it just shows up out of nowhere and we get this

292
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:32,631
really

293
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,204
great panel that people don't talk about when when they're highlighting

294
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:43,659
favorite Barks panels. This one doesn't come up as often as, like, this meeting octopus from ghosts of the g or

295
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:53,166
the dam breaking and only a poor man. But I think this is great. It's a really and nice drawing. Yeah. I I agree. Yeah. Sounds great. So on the next page,

296
00:35:54,004 --> 00:35:55,781
I really like this first panel.

297
00:35:56,638 --> 00:36:05,400
The nephews are screaming. It's a giant sea serpent and all the wild Donald is diving directly onto the boat just head first hiding away.

298
00:36:05,934 --> 00:36:33,862
I found really funny. So they start to speed away and they say there's no such farm which, of course is a callback for the title. And the serpents in the distance and their getting away from it and they're looking back. And they're like, is that real and they're kind of debating amongst themselves? Like, did we really just see that And one the nephew you says, well, for something that isn't real, that imaginary serpent makes an awful solid splash, which is you know, sort of interesting because there's and in tear the river, the creatures

299
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:48,126
serpent whatever isn't real, but this one is... I'm sure they're pretty, like shocked by that. Al first, And then Donald shows up from the bottom and there's a little wise crack out of him and, you know, we segue to the next page with a nice transition. Yeah. You know it?

300
00:36:49,058 --> 00:36:58,212
Now that you mentioned that about terror of the river, I think there's an almost identical line in that one about, you know, for something so imaginary.

301
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:15,280
It dripped real water or something. I've it's it's been recent enough that that I'm remembering that. So this isn't... This doesn't quite qualify as one of Barks like remakes of one of his stories, you know, that he likes to do sometimes, but it definitely has a few of the same beats.

302
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,954
So the next page is basically

303
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:36,905
an acknowledgment that, well, you know, we've solved the case. We figured out what happened. We just can't really do much about it. It's clear that the serpent is what sank the ship and that he must have taken it away. And so they're still wondering where it be. They they speculate that he's got a nest somewhere

304
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:42,927
and, you know, they they try again to get Donald, but Donald is is acting, like, he doesn't

305
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,855
doesn't quite hear them because he's clearly terrified

306
00:37:46,192 --> 00:37:48,289
to get anywhere near and he's bus

307
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:49,247
charming

308
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,134
worms again out of logs for fish bait.

309
00:37:53,434 --> 00:38:00,109
And so the nephew resolved that they're gonna wait until Donald is asleep and that they're gonna swipe his

310
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:14,355
the pic, I think they call it and so that they can charm it themselves. Yeah. And we get that really nice nice pair of images at the bottom with another nice donald charming worms or I guess, tiny snakes that.

311
00:38:15,268 --> 00:38:21,529
Fall for the charming and then, like, the disgusted nephews, like soaking in the boat. So on the next to page,

312
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:31,844
they they take the pic flu whatever you wanna call it. And they go off into the water and they're looking for the serpent, and they don't really find anything and one of the nephews takes the pic.

313
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:46,936
And starts blowing into it and playing it tune. And I really like that drawing of of the the, like, the puff up cheeks. I thought that was cool. And this is a really cool panel too at the bottom. But they actually end up serena or just calling attention to electric eels

314
00:38:47,568 --> 00:38:52,204
start zap them with, you know, classic cartoon comic logic of them, like,

315
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:56,719
shooting out physical thunderbolts and kind of like electro executing them.

316
00:38:57,332 --> 00:39:10,219
Right really cool visual down there. Yeah. It is a neat visual. And and it's interesting to me for a few reasons, Like, first we don't often see the nephews getting, like, violence inflicted on them. Right? That's usually

317
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:13,239
more for donald. It... It's not that it never happens.

318
00:39:14,053 --> 00:39:15,432
But that looks like it hurts.

319
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:23,916
And and then this is another example of eels are not snakes. Right? They're just they look like snakes, so they can be charmed.

320
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:38,914
And and I think they look... They actually look quite scary. Right? They're like, very, very sinister, very for ferocious just looking. And he's got the little... If you look closely he's got, like, actual, like, sharp teeth on them. Which is very scary actually.

321
00:39:39,288 --> 00:39:51,770
And they're coming... Seeming like, the lightning bolts are seemingly coming directly out of that mouth, look with teeth. So it's all very creepy, very cool. Yeah. You know, i'm I'm kinda reminded to of the the Nephews,

322
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:53,209
like animal

323
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:54,407
call whistles

324
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:56,485
later on in

325
00:39:57,038 --> 00:39:59,612
what is it the minds of King Solomon and

326
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:07,724
so far I know Safari, how they can summon they play different tunes to some in different animals. So this is kind of another

327
00:40:08,024 --> 00:40:12,164
another play on that. So on the next page, you know, the nephews are

328
00:40:12,664 --> 00:40:24,429
stuck speculating at where he could be supposing that you must be in the deep water. And then meanwhile, Donald is seeking out safe places to charm snakes. And I I really like this sequence.

329
00:40:25,004 --> 00:40:31,664
Where he's imagining the kinds of snakes that he'd liked to charm, including a hoo snake for Va,

330
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:35,899
or some musical rattle for a rattle snake band.

331
00:40:36,459 --> 00:41:00,205
Again, it's it's just Barks trying to think like what what kind of gag can you do with snake charming? Have you ever heard of a hoo snake? I actually haven't. Not that was like a little bit of a weird term when I when I was reread this one. Yeah. It's it's a mythical, like animal. It's it's a legendary thing. There aren't really hoop snakes but it was told and, like the the the my wild bill Pe

332
00:41:01,221 --> 00:41:02,299
bill, wild bill...

333
00:41:03,057 --> 00:41:05,108
One of those old like, Ducktales.

334
00:41:05,348 --> 00:41:28,512
They they talked about them there and they're just kind of a generic legend of snakes that roll around and hoops. But they're it's not real. So it's just funny that it's presented like a real one. And and so Donald approaches is a crater that was highlighted. I I I didn't mention it earlier, but there's this, like, old volcanic crater on one of the sides of this bay. And the reader instantly

335
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,004
recognizes it as

336
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:37,457
probably where the serpent lives. But Donald just sees it as a good source of, like echoes and acoustics sticks to practice.

337
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:57,359
To practice his his charming. Yeah. And this is... I think this is a super cool page. I I like the idea of Donald just kind of wandering off and letting his mind roam like he's like a kid and you're thinking about these snakes like, perfectly shaking and rhythm and, like nice top pads.

338
00:41:57,739 --> 00:42:02,139
I think it's all very cool. And I like that big fat smile he has when he's doing this Al.

339
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:03,439
Anyway,

340
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:10,968
we get to the bottom here, And I think something about, like this tin than the other panels in the bottom right corner

341
00:42:11,307 --> 00:42:35,763
sort of four shadows this big build up on the next page where the water starts to trim and, you know, Donald blows it off and he goes back to playing. And then the serpent shows up. And Donald yells out not w, but walk, w u k. I like that because I I don't where that's coming from. And he he tries to run off and the serpent tail launches out of the water and pulls him back in

342
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:53,299
serpents eyeing him and Donald, you know, some nervous rack just starts you know, shooting out all these notes of the flu pic and... You know, I really like these drawings. I think all the panels with the serpent in them are like super cool looking visually. I I think this is a really nice story in that sense.

343
00:42:54,098 --> 00:42:59,803
The these couple of pages are just bonkers. They're they're great this is the meat of the story.

344
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:04,317
When I think about Barks drying these, you know, some of these stories

345
00:43:04,936 --> 00:43:08,089
have the moment. That I think he really

346
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:11,529
decided. I wanna draw this and I wanna make this

347
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:12,329
story

348
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:31,491
work. So I'm gonna lead up to this. And I I see this on on on the page that you talked about and on this next one, you know, we've got this serpent and con comp himself and sway doing a hula dance as Donald is is backing away ever so slowly while he still plays

349
00:43:32,244 --> 00:43:33,865
and makes a break for it.

350
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:38,105
And and this imagery just this cracks me up. It's wonderful.

351
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:45,630
Don't think there's any question in my mind that the panel that has the serpent like looking gi

352
00:43:45,944 --> 00:43:46,444
while

353
00:43:46,943 --> 00:43:49,601
itself is is the winner for this

354
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:59,337
this particular story in in my book. It's just so over the top and hilarious. And And this is setting us up, right, for the next couple of pages where Donald.

355
00:43:59,895 --> 00:44:08,470
Don wants to escape, but the the serpent is in love with just dance to his his charming and music, and he can't.

356
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:12,026
Yeah. I I agree on the, like the hula

357
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:25,163
dancing image. I I just think that is so cool. And it isn't that the panel that that rosa sort of to took as its inspiration for his cover for this one It it is. With good reason, I think he... Yeah.

358
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,974
You figure that out. Yeah. It looks

359
00:44:28,311 --> 00:44:38,624
great. So we get to the next page and the serpent kind of snatch donald up and you get a really nice panel with him next to the serpent eye of clothes and

360
00:44:39,284 --> 00:44:55,880
it's really creepy looking, and he plays stuff into the the eye and the serpent just drops him on the floor. So dawn one's got no choice, but, you know, just to keep playing and he's sitting there. It keeps playing them in meanwhile, then nephew are looking around and and they're trying to find out where the serpent is, and they come across the crater.

361
00:44:56,314 --> 00:44:58,528
And they find the serpent dancing

362
00:44:58,985 --> 00:45:01,719
in the water just to Donald playing.

363
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:18,715
And Donald just playing in the back and then he just randomly screams out help, which I I kind of found funny. I do want I would do wanna add on the previous page, I really like sort of the old school use of the word jerk as like, in the... A s for idiots.

364
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:24,423
I always kinda liked that Barks and others use that. I agree. I I like that. It's a nice touch.

365
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:29,271
So on on the following page, you know, the nephews figure out

366
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:31,325
what's going on pretty quickly.

367
00:45:31,785 --> 00:45:33,165
And so they

368
00:45:33,744 --> 00:45:40,777
they use that radio to communicate for some supplies that they need and they briefly debate telling

369
00:45:41,316 --> 00:45:41,816
sc

370
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:49,459
about the situation, but they kinda decide that they'd like to kind of but they they decide to hold off on telling him

371
00:45:49,996 --> 00:45:55,566
exactly what's going on so that they can hand him the serpent and the ship in in one

372
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:02,831
in one. And so we get this neat transition where Donald is stuck for for at least a couple of days,

373
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:03,930
just

374
00:46:04,443 --> 00:46:10,084
tortured. And the nephews are like, building him little props to to hold up his

375
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:16,195
his instrument and fanning him and doing everything they can to keep him going

376
00:46:16,612 --> 00:46:18,865
until finally, the the hell

377
00:46:19,282 --> 00:46:19,782
helicopter

378
00:46:20,334 --> 00:46:26,234
dumps the supplies they requested. I I think this is a really really powerful

379
00:46:26,574 --> 00:46:28,434
few set of panels at the bottom

380
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:35,584
Like, the Barks is skill as Al as an artist really helps here where you really feel donald

381
00:46:36,123 --> 00:47:04,219
pain and like, you can feel your mouth like, drawing up as you look at him blowing and, you know, all the detailing is eyelids. I find that really cool. And I don't know this turns out in the Gladstone reprint you have, but in the in the original one at the bottom, the helicopter Barks draws it is if it's just literally dropping the stuff out of the plane, which I would like to think is sort of damaging it all beyond for repair, whatever it is. Right. So I thought that was sort of interesting.

382
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:08,299
Yeah. Thanks for... Thanks for highlighting it. Because because you're absolutely

383
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:35,674
right. The those those panels are just painful to look at. And in in the kind of way that, you know, speaks to how effective it is. Oh, yeah. And and it's definitely largely because those the drawings are so powerful. I mean, that's kinda why Barks in particular stands out among his conte at Western because you know, a lot of people weren't drawing their own work that they were writing and and when you're

384
00:47:35,974 --> 00:47:39,474
writing a script and giving it to somebody else, you know, you're not getting

385
00:47:39,908 --> 00:47:58,099
someone who has your full vision in your mind when you can illustrate your own work, you can keep whatever thing you have in your mind. If you have the skill and just go, okay. I want this to look like this. You know, I want this to be exactly like this. And I think that was also a reason it's still like why Barks in general is was superior to

386
00:47:58,598 --> 00:48:04,221
people work on the other material and the dell books Al the time. But anyway, on the next page,

387
00:48:04,779 --> 00:48:09,285
she we doing in Louie are looking over the... What they got from the helicopter.

388
00:48:09,665 --> 00:48:16,585
And they ordered blasting powder, but it ends up being barrels and barrels of pepper, which... I mean,

389
00:48:17,399 --> 00:48:26,545
is interesting. And I guess it it sort of makes sense. But in a way, i'm I'm kind of left thinking like how in the world could they screwed up the order for

390
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:40,000
for, like, tap. I mean, it's another one of those, like, crazy coincidence so, lucky this happened here. But, you know, you go along with it because at this point, you're probably so enamored with the story, you wanna see what happens.

391
00:48:40,494 --> 00:48:43,786
Yeah... This is definitely like our cartoon logic

392
00:48:44,123 --> 00:48:46,158
segment of the of the comic.

393
00:48:46,676 --> 00:48:46,955
Yeah.

394
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:48,229
So

395
00:48:48,807 --> 00:49:09,338
what they do is they load a bunch of the barrels of pepper onto a log that's, you know, tilting towards the ground and they go up on a cliff and throw a big boulder down on it, and it shoots all of the barrels into the serpent mouth and you go ahead with the next page because this is absolutely. This is spectacular. Like, the the catapult

396
00:49:10,116 --> 00:49:16,575
pepper into a creature mouth. Is a little bit hack meat but it's such a great outcome. The the serpent

397
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:31,026
swallows the barrels of pepper, and he has the kind of reaction you expect and you hope. And and that dead on perspective of the serpent kind of cotton on to what he's just eaten and and just feeling

398
00:49:31,642 --> 00:49:35,714
horrible is is hilarious. I love that so much.

399
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,755
And And the serpent basically levi

400
00:49:39,214 --> 00:49:42,605
out of his crater. In Agony and and the nephews

401
00:49:43,501 --> 00:49:47,051
get off Al line that I think they say a few times brother,

402
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,517
that's action. And we get this little

403
00:49:50,974 --> 00:49:51,474
panel

404
00:49:51,812 --> 00:49:55,861
that interestingly Barks. He doesn't show the action. He has the nephew

405
00:49:56,917 --> 00:49:57,417
describing

406
00:49:57,809 --> 00:49:58,549
the serpent

407
00:49:58,888 --> 00:49:59,388
drinking

408
00:50:00,087 --> 00:50:05,421
water to put the fire out and and and he ends up nearly drinking the crater

409
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,080
dry.

410
00:50:07,332 --> 00:50:10,704
Exposing the ship and leaving the serpent, just

411
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:12,260
w and agony

412
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:13,856
with a bloated

413
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:30,315
belly and torso so looking very funny. I I wonder if it was just too if Barks thought it would have been looked too ridiculous to show him drinking it all up or or maybe he was worried about his page count, but it was an interesting little gloss.

414
00:50:31,247 --> 00:50:43,253
But it but it's it's a fantastic. It's definitely a standout page. And and and if this story, this story has to work for you, I guess, to appreciate these. Because it's just so ridiculous.

415
00:50:43,631 --> 00:50:48,797
I I totally agree. It's it i... For me, it is the standout page.

416
00:50:49,389 --> 00:50:54,399
You know, you got four of five panels that are just brim with action.

417
00:50:54,856 --> 00:51:00,044
Well really full. You can feel the you know, the energy coming out of those, then.

418
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:06,724
What's interesting? I don't know if if... Because I figured you would've have mentioned it, but you didn't. I was immediately drawing comparisons to

419
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:24,699
dose of the g where the nephews are putting Chili pepper over the the, you know, the hun of meat and the octopus shoots out of the scene. We get another cool splash panel. I was thinking Barks to that one when they yeah. The pepper into the service mouth. Yeah. I'm I'm I'm ashamed of myself to

420
00:51:25,198 --> 00:51:31,730
gloss over it, especially since ghost of the g is one of my all time favorites. So so, yeah, this is

421
00:51:32,682 --> 00:51:39,078
another iteration of that gray bit. Yeah. I I would be hard pressed to choose which one's my favorite

422
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:41,524
version of the gag, but

423
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:53,354
this one's pretty cool, but I haven't read coast of the g in a long time. So I I remember vividly, I I would have read the two of them, you know, because they were in... They were both Donald Ducktales adventures

424
00:51:54,414 --> 00:52:10,367
published within about a year and a half of each other. And I I read both of these over and over or I've got these dog ear copies. But I I'm not sure I've ever laughed as hard as I did the very first time I read the op... The that octopus sequence. But

425
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:17,479
that's a digress. Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely great sequence. But anyway, on the next page,

426
00:52:17,936 --> 00:52:25,278
then nephews run off, and they get all excited. They assume that the the the serpent either, you know, passed out or dead or led to bare minimum

427
00:52:25,897 --> 00:52:33,333
unconscious. So one of them runs off gets excited, they're gonna go get uncle Scrooge and show them what happened. But the serpent gets up,

428
00:52:33,971 --> 00:52:36,204
hiccup and and almost like drunk away.

429
00:52:38,013 --> 00:52:56,841
So he runs off, trying to get more water and he grabs the boat with him. And he sinks back into the sea or the river or whatever you would wanna call it and I I do kinda like in the bottom. We we get donald in the background. Just kinda reminding you Donald is too. It's not just cool soap been drawing. What, I find interesting

430
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:01,250
is the ending where, you know, it it reminds me of

431
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:14,660
twenty four carrot moon, that story is ending. I think that's a great story. That's a later food adventure. But in that one, you know, I I don't wanna spoil anything, but obviously, there's a moon made of solid gold that Scrooge

432
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:34,331
trying to get to and, you know, he gets to it, but something happens where he's there and he kind of contemplate at the end like it worked really hard for this and I'm here and it's what I wanted, but is it what I wanted? And that's it's kind... It's not that deep here. But it's kind of in that case,

433
00:53:34,948 --> 00:53:50,474
you know, Scrooge works very hard, like long endless days to get to the moon and at this point, the nephews have been working very hard long endless days to, you know, find out what happened to the ship and they have the ship there for evidence and this, you know, crazy,

434
00:53:50,813 --> 00:53:58,265
you know, mythical creature And the ship and the creature, just both sink back into the sea where, you know, probably no one will ever

435
00:53:58,618 --> 00:54:17,490
find out about them again. So I found that interesting and then on the next page, which you're gonna cover obviously, you kinda you're kind of return to the status quo. Yeah. I I like that comparison. It it strikes me that there... It feels like there's a lot of panels like that near the in the end of some of the stories with the Ducktales kind of looking

436
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,355
after something, you know, una.

437
00:54:22,823 --> 00:54:26,515
What a great page that was too. I I love Donald like

438
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:30,746
sigh of relief at the end when the serpent is finally

439
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:33,839
finally left him in peace,

440
00:54:34,499 --> 00:54:37,099
and he can be real. He can be, like human again.

441
00:54:37,659 --> 00:54:48,914
And the and the drunk looking serpent, it that one cracks me up as well. So so you mentioned it. It's that's exactly right. We're going back to the status quo. And this is where we get the little book and.

442
00:54:49,848 --> 00:54:53,903
No. I guess not yet. We don't see that great men. Yet. We get we get the Nephews

443
00:54:55,001 --> 00:55:01,807
acknowledging again that, you know, we we can't even bother telling uncle Scrooge because we know what he'll say,

444
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:04,305
there's no such var

445
00:55:05,298 --> 00:55:19,904
i I like that use of the word environment. And they go back to their rut. They kind of acknowledge for the reader, They voice out loud that, yeah, mcdonald's solved it, but he wasn't even trying to. And then we get this convenient moment where that

446
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:20,980
professor

447
00:55:21,356 --> 00:55:25,261
runs up saying that he's been looking for them and that he needs to

448
00:55:25,837 --> 00:55:34,008
fix the terrible mistake that he's made and take us home. Yeah. So the professor shows up, you know, seemingly out of nowhere, and

449
00:55:34,704 --> 00:55:46,266
it's funny, and we get some good bits out of it, but even when I first read this story, At the beginning, when Donald brain is being examined in the one fifteen shows up, I immediately knew

450
00:55:46,724 --> 00:56:03,851
what that one fifteen correspond with but it was still interesting Al the ending. The professor shows up and says Donald got a very rare Al that he should become the world's greatest snake charm, which I I think some people could have seen coming a million miles away like I did, But, you know,

451
00:56:04,704 --> 00:56:15,346
still, I I I do think it's kinda funny, especially the panel that follows where Donald just totally shaken up. And we go back to the same park that hugh doing in Liu were in at the beginning, you know, Al,

452
00:56:16,342 --> 00:56:24,599
great men of their time. There's gold, the great engineer rich and famous. One of them reiterate that yes, Rich and famous.

453
00:56:24,978 --> 00:56:32,206
And then mick Owl, the great judge wise and respected. And another one reiterate yeah wise and respected.

454
00:56:32,585 --> 00:56:46,694
I think that drawing is is a little weird looking. It's it's almost like a Huey, Al hybrid, more so then most of his owl judges that he had drawn at the past or in the future. So then one of the nephew he's sitting at the training goes, people are funny,

455
00:56:47,308 --> 00:56:53,471
Some are great, and some of them are like donald and we end on a really nice visual of the donald.

456
00:56:53,928 --> 00:57:02,584
Just picking up trash in the park, totally three of his flute and then not doing any sort of charming and, you know, just happily going along humming a tune.

457
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:06,749
Yeah. I look looking very content. And i I'm glad that you

458
00:57:07,248 --> 00:57:18,934
I'm glad that you read what the Nephews were saying there because it's it's very poetic. Right? That, like, little colin or response, they have rich and famous? Yes, Rich and famous.

459
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:29,049
It's it's a really elegant way to have closed out the story and then in a neat book end and It's striking how happy he shows Donald just

460
00:57:29,389 --> 00:57:37,104
picking up litter. I I do really like the payoff. You're right. It's it's we see it coming from a million miles away, but his little

461
00:57:37,404 --> 00:57:37,904
panic

462
00:57:38,244 --> 00:57:38,744
panel

463
00:57:39,244 --> 00:57:39,744
at

464
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:46,799
at being told he should be a snake Charm. That definitely lands for me. That one is is really funny. Mh.

465
00:57:47,179 --> 00:57:48,359
It's a great drawing.

466
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:54,290
Yeah. So So this one has a really cool structure, you know, the the book ending

467
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:56,527
with the fantastical

468
00:57:57,186 --> 00:57:58,965
adventure in the middle. I

469
00:57:59,398 --> 00:58:05,518
I really like this story. I I read this a ton as a kid. I think some of it was just my general

470
00:58:05,855 --> 00:58:09,302
fascination with c serpents and how much I loved Barks

471
00:58:10,341 --> 00:58:12,199
design for serpents.

472
00:58:13,178 --> 00:58:30,355
It it kind of lands in an interesting place because I mentioned it is in his like, what what most people agree is his golden age of comics. And so you get these, like, pretty good comics mixed in with these just absolutely legendary ones. And I feel like maybe this one gets

473
00:58:30,709 --> 00:58:36,549
gets a little bit less attention for that reason. I don't know. What what what are your impressions of this one Austin?

474
00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:39,064
Yeah. I I sort of agree

475
00:58:39,604 --> 00:58:40,784
I think in general,

476
00:58:41,204 --> 00:58:44,024
the Barks fans are more attracted to

477
00:58:44,324 --> 00:59:07,385
something that's like all around very, like, whim and and fan fantastic stick and where they go away off into some far land. But what I found interesting about this one is that I couldn't really get into the mindset of this being sort of faraway away land because for all we know, like, what was it called Barn Bay? I mean, that could've have just been a few miles, you know, north or south of wherever the Ducktales live. So you know,

478
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:12,335
in that sense, it it feels a little weird a little off, but

479
00:59:12,754 --> 00:59:43,898
I think it's got some great visuals, some great art. I mean, obviously, the the panels with the serpent are all equally great, narrative wise, like story wise. It's not one of his greatest, but I mean, obviously, it's still a fantastic story. Right. I'll I I would probably put this one in in, like, my top fifteen or twelve Barks stories. I don't know if it would make the top ten, but it would definitely be up there somewhere. So that's that's pretty high praise. Right? Considering the number of them. That he's got.

480
00:59:44,437 --> 00:59:51,064
This one obviously sticks with you. There's a lot about it. That's really interesting and I think generally

481
00:59:51,564 --> 00:59:52,904
how weird it is

482
00:59:53,204 --> 01:00:24,811
is what stands out to me. It's also interesting there's no human characters once they get to the that barn bay area. Right? It's just it's just them in the serpent. That's a big part of the dynamic of this one. Mh. Yeah. That's actually an interesting point. I can't think of many, you know, ten pager adventures Scrooge adventures whatever where they're they're totally on their own. I'm sure there's one or two, but, you know, even in the very eerie ominous and and fantastic ghost of the g,

483
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:28,726
you know, there's always some sort of creatures, some

484
01:00:29,065 --> 01:00:29,565
or

485
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:30,619
something

486
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:35,679
that's kind of there beside them are in their midst. And in in this one,

487
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:48,592
I mean, they're totally alone. Minus serpent and themselves, of course, know, it's they're totally isolated from the rest of the world. And I find that really interesting. Right. And and he has such a parade of notable,

488
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:49,288
like,

489
01:00:50,086 --> 01:00:51,303
drive by characters

490
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:55,664
at the beginning and end that maybe he was like, I don't need more humans

491
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:11,782
in this one. Because, like, they're really great character designs for all of those, like quote, great men that walk by the nephews. I think they're they're really memorable considering they each get one panel. Mh. And they all look pretty great. I already said Nick Al,

492
01:01:12,462 --> 01:01:17,156
the great judge in particular, looks looks pretty funky but cool I have to say.

493
01:01:17,615 --> 01:01:31,240
Right Yeah, they all look great. He he great at Al character designs, a unique character design with that. So you and I both both really enjoyed this one. I wouldn't i I'd would probably put this one kind of in my high middle

494
01:01:31,779 --> 01:01:38,649
tier. I would say not like not like all time great, but but quite great or or at least very good.

495
01:01:39,189 --> 01:01:47,184
As far as the community goes, I'm sure you know that I like to check on index and and how the community has rated

496
01:01:47,523 --> 01:01:48,023
these

497
01:01:48,801 --> 01:02:03,141
compared to the others. This one is pretty well regarded as you might expect. It's about a seven point seven out of ten, which is good for one hundred and fifty seven ranked out of all forty one thousand

498
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,039
etcetera.

499
01:02:04,534 --> 01:02:12,177
Disney comics that have been ranked on index. So, you know, even for Barks, that's that's pretty high. Right? Because there's probably

500
01:02:12,969 --> 01:02:15,629
there's probably a good seventy or eighty

501
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:23,224
stories in that top hundred and fifty that are not even Barks. So this one's probably somewhere in the top, like,

502
01:02:23,984 --> 01:02:28,576
ten percent of Barks story by the community. Yeah. I was...

503
01:02:28,994 --> 01:02:32,246
I was looking at Ducktales earlier and I was actually shocked to see

504
01:02:32,584 --> 01:02:40,437
like, the majority of his four color mcdonald's are in the top a hundred. Yeah. And just... I mean, I I don't like to

505
01:02:40,934 --> 01:02:57,839
solely judge a a story popularity or or people's preference based off of the index thing, especially because there are a lot of weird stories in the top one hundred. But... Yeah. No. It's weird because a lot of what I would consider to be his weakest stuff as far as the four Al on go,

506
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:13,293
are very high in the top one hundred. And, you know, I think this one definitely just deserves something in you know, maybe even just the bottom half of the hundreds, maybe something like seventy or seventy five. If I had to pick one, I guess it could swap places with. I would say, the insanely

507
01:03:13,671 --> 01:03:14,171
overrated

508
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:46,502
adventure down under, which I think Actually talked to you about a while ago that we were both kind of shocked that that was as high as it was. Yeah. There are a few. I mean, I I've kind of said my theory before that some of them just stand out more in people's minds. Right? Like, that's that's his big Australia adventure, and it's definitely got its stuff to like, but But I agree. It's not a it's not a top ten story. Yeah. I mean... I mean, index is obviously not perfect, but it's the hand thing that I've got to get an idea

509
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:53,446
of what the community thinks. And they've generally got a pretty good number like statistically

510
01:03:54,158 --> 01:03:56,252
of people voting for the stories

511
01:03:56,708 --> 01:04:00,436
to to give you a good idea But there are definitely some some weird

512
01:04:00,972 --> 01:04:01,472
anomalies

513
01:04:02,063 --> 01:04:10,377
I think I remember from our our initial chat. I think you were rag a little bit on terror of the river. Right? Oh, yeah. It's

514
01:04:11,009 --> 01:04:11,908
see it's interesting

515
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:17,421
with a lot of Barks is earliest stories or rather the the adventures

516
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,034
what I find is that

517
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:30,224
before what... I guess, the benchmark would be golden Christmas tree. That's the earliest one I can think of that's you know, sort of goof and and lighter than anything he had done before.

518
01:04:30,683 --> 01:04:32,222
They're all very serious,

519
01:04:32,681 --> 01:04:40,514
like seriously toned and you know, not to say that his fifties stories didn't have a genuine stakes in them. But here there are, like, genuine

520
01:04:40,894 --> 01:04:47,769
stakes like you know, ghost of the g if, you know, if you don't find, you know, the the nephew that's disappeared, you know, he's

521
01:04:48,069 --> 01:05:00,509
disappeared for good. Right You the old castle secret for all, you know, I mean, you know, those those ghosts and skeletons are real and they're out to get you. I mean... Yeah. We had actual actual skeleton in that one too. Mh.

522
01:05:00,929 --> 01:05:02,109
Yeah. But I I

523
01:05:02,409 --> 01:05:07,869
I've read a lot of those. And probably most of them But tariffs the river always felt like

524
01:05:08,383 --> 01:05:11,752
a little too serious for me. It almost felt like

525
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:13,505
some of Barks is

526
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,669
later, not later work, but

527
01:05:16,368 --> 01:05:25,834
we work, which is, I guess, is late fifty stuff. And almost like some of the worst Don Rosa stories where they're just pages and pages of Talk talkie.

528
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:38,405
Know, there's decent action in it. But all I remember from reading it is just... There's so much dialogue and and when Donald gets... I I... It's like kidnapped. Right? And he's underground with, like this crack in the submarine.

529
01:05:38,944 --> 01:05:58,903
They're just pages and panels and panels that this guy talking and talking. I mean, obviously, you know, that's great potential with the c serpent as we saw with this story, but between the two, I would always choose this one, but I I I don't know I would be interested to hear what you have to say if you think that one's better than this one. See I I love this because these stories are like, almost

530
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:04,947
engineered to be compared. To each other. Right? There is is two big c serpent adventures.

531
01:06:05,525 --> 01:06:06,025
And

532
01:06:06,523 --> 01:06:10,256
the the design is so similar. So I was I was kind of

533
01:06:10,928 --> 01:06:14,098
chomp at the bit did the opportunity to to

534
01:06:14,634 --> 01:06:33,111
advocate more terror of the river. Because I do think terror of the river is much stronger and I do like that one better. I like them both for different reasons, of course, but that one just stands out in my mind even though the serpent in that one ends up not being real, there's like such a neat pal

535
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:43,644
terror and and fear in that one, you know? And then the serpent just looks so men. And I just love that bonkers villain. And I love the idea of a guy who's

536
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:48,299
kinda twisted in that he he just gets his jo by

537
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:50,479
by wanting to scare people.

538
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:54,234
So that one is one that I consider

539
01:06:54,734 --> 01:07:01,241
wildly under underrated. So it's it's interesting. Everyone's got you know, that Barks had so many stories

540
01:07:01,578 --> 01:07:03,452
that everyone's gonna have their own favorite.

541
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:11,785
Everyone's gonna have their their stories that they feel are under underrated or over overrated. And I love hearing what people think

542
01:07:12,563 --> 01:07:17,627
is especially under underrated. That that really fascinating me me. It's

543
01:07:18,044 --> 01:07:24,780
interesting though. I told you that this one gets a seven point seven good for a hundred and fifty seven. Terror of the river.

544
01:07:25,394 --> 01:07:26,773
Seven point seven

545
01:07:27,152 --> 01:07:29,469
hundred and thirty six. They're like,

546
01:07:30,468 --> 01:07:35,378
clustered right there with each other and terror, the river just gets the slightest edge.

547
01:07:36,235 --> 01:07:48,534
Oh interesting yourself. Yeah. Yeah. I I like that. I don't I don't like to pin stories against each other usually, but I Almost feel like you can't avoid it with with this pair of stories. Yeah.

548
01:07:48,954 --> 01:07:53,581
I I I agree. I mean, they both have their merits. Right? Personally,

549
01:07:54,078 --> 01:08:04,599
I might say I would prefer the visuals and tear of the river more. I mean, the style overall Barks is mid forty style, I think it's kind of cool.

550
01:08:04,937 --> 01:08:08,786
Visually, I I think I would have to give it to no such farm

551
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:32,955
you know, they're both cool. But, you know, personally, I I I think no such farm cooler. Yeah. Excellent. So just to wrap things up, a few elections. I do like to mention how the story holds up in general. It's nice. This one doesn't have anything that's like really problematic to talk about I mean, other than the fact that snake charming is is now widely seen as

552
01:08:33,732 --> 01:08:40,743
as cruel treatment. I I I looked a little bit into it, apparently, a a lot of snake charm

553
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:52,252
would do things to to the animals that resulted in, like, their early death to to make them safe to charm. But and it's worth mentioning too that snakes can't hear

554
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:53,291
the way

555
01:08:54,149 --> 01:09:12,124
the way we do. So they're not like responding to music, the way that that it's poor trade. It's more like a a a reaction to the movement, I guess, of the instrument instruments itself. So so that's interesting. But in general, this one holds up, I think pretty well. Let's see. There are

556
01:09:12,821 --> 01:09:21,040
there there's no oil paintings or lit graphs for this one as far as I'm aware. And and what a shame, wouldn't it have been great to see that

557
01:09:21,697 --> 01:09:25,529
to see a lit though of the serpent swing? Yeah.

558
01:09:26,103 --> 01:09:36,006
Wow that would have been really great. No. I I totally agree. I think when I was again, when I was, like it's like the, you know, the casual Barks fan that I once was

559
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:41,159
I would see the painting Barks did for terror of the river

560
01:09:41,474 --> 01:09:46,734
which Gladstone used for the cover of their album with that one or like a version

561
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:48,214
by somebody

562
01:09:48,528 --> 01:09:51,555
I always saw that and I thought that was four no such permanent.

563
01:09:52,232 --> 01:09:53,329
But you know, they're both

564
01:09:53,706 --> 01:09:55,002
great pieces. But

565
01:09:55,634 --> 01:09:58,614
That he's interesting in this sense that I think in old California

566
01:09:59,114 --> 01:10:03,414
also is is like another Barks adventure where, you know, he didn't do the cover

567
01:10:03,808 --> 01:10:17,456
and then he didn't do any paintings or lit photographs. So he kinda did the story and and that was sort of it, which is interesting, I think. Yeah. That's true. And then I I mentioned, you know, sometimes the stories will have been adapted into

568
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:24,860
tails as far as I'm aware, you know, that that never happened for this one, although there were a few c serpents stories.

569
01:10:25,233 --> 01:10:26,252
Any any

570
01:10:26,748 --> 01:10:29,919
contenders for favorite panel that we didn't already

571
01:10:30,775 --> 01:10:33,925
talk about or or one that you wanna give a little bit of love to again?

572
01:10:35,659 --> 01:10:39,839
Okay. This is interesting. I would say it's a three way tie

573
01:10:40,619 --> 01:10:41,119
between

574
01:10:41,714 --> 01:10:42,214
maybe

575
01:10:42,834 --> 01:10:44,974
the... When the serpent first emerges,

576
01:10:45,434 --> 01:10:50,434
right? And he's looking over the boat from the right side. At the end when Donald shit shook,

577
01:10:51,127 --> 01:10:56,891
shaken up whatever. You know, and he's got all those eye multiples. And the third one would probably be...

578
01:10:57,229 --> 01:11:02,212
When he's wandering through the woods and he's thinking about the three snakes in the tele tat,

579
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:07,007
I think that's a really cool one too. Oh, yeah. Those those are all strong choices.

580
01:11:07,426 --> 01:11:12,055
I'm a sucker for the, like stand out panels. So it's hard for me to resist.

581
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:13,653
Any of the really

582
01:11:14,391 --> 01:11:16,329
spectacular shots of the serpent

583
01:11:17,241 --> 01:11:32,178
itself. But if I force myself to talk about some non ones, I I do love the the panel where the little worm is looks so ashamed of himself. And I think Donald reaction shot that you pointed out when the nephews are just out of nowhere.

584
01:11:32,552 --> 01:11:59,665
Telling him he should feel ashamed of himself. Anyway, there this one, more than many has just a a huge number of of great great panels in it. Any any additional thoughts any anything that you really wanted us to talk about that we didn't get to? There is there's one tiny point that I was kind of leaving in the back of my mind, but what I find, interesting is that Donald in a lot of like a Barks stories sort of is easily

585
01:12:00,123 --> 01:12:06,930
influenced by, like, whatever fad going on or, you know, if he sees an ad for like, a job. He's very easily

586
01:12:07,484 --> 01:12:12,703
his views will change the snap of a finger if, you know, you talked him about something.

587
01:12:13,043 --> 01:12:14,543
But in this story, he

588
01:12:14,884 --> 01:12:36,857
maintains this very strict uniqueness to his character. Right? Like, he's himself who is a, you know, a snake charm as weird as that is when he's supposed to be you know, for all he knows this great detective. But he just wants to be a snake charm, you know? And and I don't think Barks would have usually kept that like that. I think that's interesting.

589
01:12:37,356 --> 01:12:43,449
Beyond that though, that that's sort of it, we've talked about the great panels a ton, you know, It's a great story visually.

590
01:12:43,883 --> 01:12:55,526
Bit of a weaker story narrative wise, but I think overall, it's a really nice piece of work. Yeah. Those those are good thoughts. And I agree with you. It's interesting to see It's interesting to see him so content

591
01:12:56,264 --> 01:12:57,324
sort of with his humble

592
01:12:57,703 --> 01:13:01,379
here. Well, I think we had a really good conversation.

593
01:13:02,072 --> 01:13:13,615
About this story Austin I really appreciate it. It it'll it'll be great to have you on for another the... It sounds like you're a big fan of the ten pager. Too. I and would be fun to have you on, I think from one of those.

594
01:13:14,175 --> 01:13:37,878
Like. And you're you're coming up on... What would essentially be, I think the golden age of those ten pages. I mean, you had some great ones in in the late forties, some of which I you might, have actually covered Sunken yacht with this a great one. But, you know, the the the sc centric ones like, you know, tariff the Beagle boys. I mean, these are these are all really great on par with the best of the adventures. Oh, yeah. You're you're right. There's like

595
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:44,977
one to two dozen in a row coming up right around this time that are just spectacular. And and you mentioned

596
01:13:45,609 --> 01:13:47,106
our our next

597
01:13:47,445 --> 01:13:53,452
episode is gonna cover the story that you mentioned. We get to talk about Donald Duck in old California.

598
01:13:53,950 --> 01:14:01,064
So I hope hope people will join us on the show for that one because that that is another very notable,

599
01:14:01,444 --> 01:14:06,899
very memorable story. People are welcome to reach out if they have a comment, Barks

600
01:14:07,139 --> 01:14:08,579
remarks at gmail dot com.

601
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:17,134
Mostly people reach out on the Face book page, which is fine. Still kinda kinda trying to think of a good way to end these gracefully.

602
01:14:17,434 --> 01:14:17,934
But

603
01:14:18,394 --> 01:14:19,494
no such environments

604
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:25,469
Flirt with greatness here and there. So thanks, Austin. Any time. Great story.
