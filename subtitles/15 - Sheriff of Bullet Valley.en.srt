00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:59,228
Welcome back. I am excited to be back with another returning guest host for the classic story sheriff of bullet Valley, but

3
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:06,225
introductions first. Guest host. Who are you? My name is Eric Hart, Al lover of Ducktales and Western.

4
00:01:06,838 --> 00:01:12,241
Awesome. So that was gonna be my first question, Eric. Are are you a western fan because

5
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:12,738
boy,

6
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:14,771
it's it's gonna help with this one.

7
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:20,325
Yeah. I I grew up on Western as a kid. I have had to do

8
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:21,445
projects

9
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:34,884
on hop cassidy, some versed in the old era. Big fan of the lessons of the air is from this cop as well. Nice. So even specifically this era, right? And and we are talking sheriff of bullet valley in the late forties.

10
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:44,280
So let's see we've got what... I think treasure of the Sierra Andre came out the same year as this one. Yeah. I don't know that is qualified as a western.

11
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:56,604
It's it's the that time frame. Yeah. But... Yeah. John Wayne was in his his heyday around this Mh. So I'm glad to hear it. I thought you might have been western fan. I'm I'm not a big western fan,

12
00:01:57,102 --> 00:01:57,602
but

13
00:01:58,658 --> 00:01:59,637
you're you're gasping.

14
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:14,095
But I do like... I mean, I like some western adjacent stories. And I I mean, this one, I I think I introduced it as Al classic. I I love this story. I'm so excited to talk about this one.

15
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,990
So so let's get into it.

16
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,090
Hey, really quickly though. What what are some of your favorite western?

17
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,330
Winchester seventy six with Jimmy Stewart very good.

18
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,243
This some classic

19
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:27,681
man with donate

20
00:02:28,779 --> 00:02:29,857
clint east.

21
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:31,795
There was some early

22
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:35,222
I've seen some really telling. The the sons of Katie elder is one of his good ones.

23
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:36,380
True grit,

24
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:44,401
later ones in the eighties, I grew up on the one called Silver silverado with Kevin Kevin Klein and then just so many

25
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,799
western novels

26
00:02:46,258 --> 00:02:55,803
from Ou moore when we do Road trips as a kid, just all sorts of them. Wow. So so... Yeah. So you're like, the the target audience for this one, basically.

27
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:57,820
Yes. Yes.

28
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:01,935
So do you like... Do you think you like like, the spaghetti West,

29
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:06,475
the classic aero ones, the like later era revision ones?

30
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:16,725
Well, the they'll have place. I think of those three, the later revision ones, I'm not the big fan of because the Western

31
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:21,685
growing up and how they are modeled in society was always the

32
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:24,125
lone hero or the

33
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,796
struggling farmer against the the the land Barks.

34
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:28,815
And

35
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:30,014
when

36
00:03:30,353 --> 00:03:34,264
they brought them up the new one, the revisions wants that a week. Late

37
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,726
always all on the x... Just a lot more file lot more gritty which certainly has its place

38
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:47,124
but it's just very different western they grew up with so I'm not the biggest fan. I guess.

39
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:50,970
The original Magnificent seven was fantastic. Yeah. The remake,

40
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:57,906
Not so much. It was it was an entertaining movie. But far as Western go, it just... It didn't do it for me. So

41
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,995
sheriff from bullet Valley is a real love letter.

42
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:04,978
To Tv and movie western. Right? This is

43
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:06,950
incredibly of its time.

44
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:13,605
This this is gonna be fun to talk about. So the story is published in

45
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:19,746
October of nineteen forty eight in the comic four color number one hundred and ninety nine

46
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:31,885
I checked number of reprint. This one's been reprint quite a lot in the Us ten ten different prints were listed. And this is one of our longer stories that we've looked. This is a thirty two pager.

47
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:33,085
And

48
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:37,885
Eric, I didn't talk to you about this, but you wanna you wanna give the synopsis

49
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,695
or do you want me to go for it? I got this...

50
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:45,150
Essentially, this story is donald in and nephews.

51
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:47,543
And they come across a

52
00:04:48,282 --> 00:05:06,134
town area called both valley you see a poster saying you know, rust in the area, big reward available and Donald does love with Western besides the angles. I know Hud beings for cut us. I'm gonna go assignments up up those deputy convince this year that he should be good deputy goes up to trying to find the the

53
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:07,131
Wrestlers

54
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:08,847
and then

55
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:11,121
comes across individuals

56
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:20,409
who say, no. We're getting russell. Turns out that they are the real rust, and they've got a quite the neat trick as to convince everyone the brand

57
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:25,130
they're... Their their cat actually hit. Once the net couldn't,

58
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,663
show up to say the day,

59
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:36,302
convince Donald that he was wrong. The bad guy gets away and Dom has to track him for the badlands and use his gum if you will to

60
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:44,905
beat the villain and capture capture the evil catalyst foot. Right on. Yeah. So his his knowledge of the angles is gonna pay off eventually.

61
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,051
Yeah. So this this is really about Cowboy cliches.

62
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:56,329
Right? And about the the idea of the west and the idea of the Hollywood wild West.

63
00:05:56,746 --> 00:05:58,484
And is interesting

64
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:03,208
how we're meant, I think at the beginning to think of Donald

65
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:04,961
as you know, foolish

66
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,393
and wrong headed and

67
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,795
then we're really supposed to regard him as

68
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,195
heroic by the end. So

69
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:14,195
this is

70
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:16,195
an interesting love letter

71
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:22,923
to what I I've heard called the horse opera. Yes. The the proper term for Domino's be green horn.

72
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,919
Right. Yeah. Excellent.

73
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:28,650
So here's Al little bit of background trivia about this story.

74
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:35,469
I read a pretty good article by the editor Jeffrey Blu in in my reprint of this. And

75
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:43,943
Blu talks about how Carl Barks was well known as being a fan of horse opera, you know, it it's very obvious and this one that he

76
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,992
wanted to create this kind of love letter.

77
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:55,037
I did learn some new stuff from this one. I found that this story it uses some elements from a a Mickey mouse cartoon

78
00:06:55,416 --> 00:07:00,090
that Barks had had story boarded back when he was working for the film division.

79
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:02,957
That that never ended up being

80
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:05,727
completed. It was called Northwest mounted,

81
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:09,350
it had pete as the villain. So, you know, black snake

82
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,230
kinda of fits nicely

83
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,590
into that villain slot in this one. And the little yoyo

84
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:22,933
segment, the treatment that he gives black snake at the end is taken straight from that story board. And what... Don't don't waste a good idea.

85
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:27,026
Right. And Bo is gonna go back to this well a few times

86
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:32,430
for his stories. You know, there's gonna be a few of these wild west sort of dude ranch

87
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:33,787
themed stories.

88
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:35,163
It's a setting that he likes.

89
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:41,106
He doesn't do it too much in the adventure length ones. I can think of in old California

90
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:45,616
offhand and then a few like old mining town ones

91
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:55,660
oh the one, the good mystery of the ghost town railroad, I think it was called. But... Yeah, he he does... He definitely enjoys... Enjoys this genre.

92
00:07:57,071 --> 00:08:10,693
I thought it was interesting that right in the beginning of this one, it seems to be one of a small number of times that Donald is gonna break the fourth wall where he kind of addressed is the reader directly. And then there is a fun little car of Barks

93
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:15,324
himself on the very last page of this. That people can keep an eye for.

94
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:19,824
He's I think he's in a wanted poster or something like this that he drove himself.

95
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:22,044
A few of the

96
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:32,242
I didn't share with you the titles from around the world. Can I send it to the chat real quick? Here. This is this will be fun just doing it like,

97
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:36,487
right off the top. Alright. I've sent you some of the titles

98
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,297
oh, the top one is Denmark.

99
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:44,904
Let me let me do Denmark. So the Danish title from Denmark, this one is Cher

100
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:46,885
e six Logo Al

101
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:52,645
where the sheriff of the six Gun Valley, I believe is the pronunciation. Wow.

102
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,360
Do you wanna do...

103
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,040
You wanna try France? Do you wanna try Spam?

104
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,180
Start Friends. Alright.

105
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:01,493
Louie.

106
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,230
Alright.

107
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:14,713
Who calls the shots. Yeah. And that one is like I think a eu in french. Right? Who's Who's the shock collar? Alright. And then in Spain, this one is El cher, D la the last.

108
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,920
Share valley of the bullets. Yeah.

109
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,301
Let's see you wanna do the Dutch title there for Netherlands.

110
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:24,015
Hang on dishes

111
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:26,146
google Al,

112
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,657
Yep. Direct. You're

113
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:30,774
Valley. Awesome awesome.

114
00:09:31,513 --> 00:09:33,810
And then I'll do... I'll do Italy and Leave you Mexico.

115
00:09:34,602 --> 00:09:35,621
Italy is

116
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,730
mit

117
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,803
sheriff of

118
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:44,290
machine gun valley, I think is is actually the

119
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,570
translation in Mexican awesome.

120
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,410
Mexico.

121
00:09:48,470 --> 00:10:02,018
By at least the sheer happy bell. Yeah. I I don't know why that printing calls it happy valley. But but there you go. Alright. So we've got our background trivia. We've got our titles from around the world.

122
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:03,257
So

123
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:11,105
value wise, I found a nine point two edition of this that was sold for two thousand five hundred dollars.

124
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:11,765
So...

125
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:14,825
Yeah. These are getting a little bit more affordable.

126
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:20,540
There there may come a point where we don't where we're not really interested in the value anymore. But.

127
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,800
Yeah. Still fun to know. So the background

128
00:10:24,314 --> 00:10:38,115
I'm not gonna talk too much right now about this because I think we can touch on it naturally throughout the story. But to me, like the sub of this, the cultural sub is like the collision of the old West and the new west.

129
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:38,890
Right?

130
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:51,585
We've got... We've got kind of the the cowboys, the the ranch hands that have been doing this the old way and the story versus the new modern way and then we've got

131
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:52,919
Of course,

132
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:58,570
all of the Hollywood cliches and how that intersect with the reality of the west.

133
00:10:59,265 --> 00:11:02,165
And then, of course, you know, we've got this this era

134
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:03,365
consistent

135
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:13,921
fascination with like ray gun. Are gonna show up in this one. Right? Radar, it's the same thing with, like, uranium and and atomic energy.

136
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:17,843
How it's kind of this catch all. Right? And it can do anything.

137
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:28,780
I mean, I I love it. I love it. As a Mac ago in this story, I think it I think it feels very natural, but, you know, it's it's definitely a little bit of, like, magic story juice.

138
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,534
Sure. It's just...

139
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:38,975
It's that error right after the Wall war and, you know, and radar was a big thing, and it was just says okay. Well, let's do rays.

140
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:44,099
Yeah to discover all this aspect to like traumatic from Al that scale.

141
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:50,705
Yeah. Exactly. A notable appearances in this one. You know, he's a one off villain, but Black snake

142
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:57,225
To me is very notable. He is one of the cooler villains I think Barks has ever used.

143
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,780
Yeah. He he has a good development

144
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,900
and good

145
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:15,295
come up in a really good actual really good plan for ben he's a solid day yeah. Yeah. It's true. And and do you know what I really like about him unlike a lot of Disney villains,

146
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,930
I I never

147
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,690
have any doubt that he will straight up murder Donald.

148
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:48,295
Yes. He is yes. He an intense frightening going to me. So as far as Donald goes, which version of him we've got this is the one where he starts out is very over confident and then he kinda of calibrate and and and switches into that sort of determined get it done version of don. Yeah. We don't really see the cow version of him from that we saw in Bear Mountain. Yeah. That's true. That's the most recent one.

149
00:12:49,467 --> 00:13:02,240
Apart from from Barks Africa. We did that one recently where, you know, Barks needed him to be a coward in this one he needs him to be brave. So that's that's what he does. He's Donald as his every man. Alright. Eric...

150
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:06,835
Any any other pre story comments before we talk about the actual

151
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:08,088
part of this one?

152
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:16,685
Well, I I just quickly on when your last comment was. Donald is... Yes, he's not coward but in this aspect, he's so

153
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:18,845
inundated and obsessed with Western

154
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:33,378
that he's convinced himself. I've watched them all. I can do this. This is what I am. So that kinda overcomes that typical coward to stop him even those nephews are like really? He's like, absolutely. I can do this and that never really waivers.

155
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:51,965
Yeah. Yeah. That's a good... That's a good sum submission of it. Right. Alright. So the Sheriff of bullet Valley opens with a kind of sol on the old west. We've got Donald and the Nephews driving through the west, but the the focus is more on the scenery first. And the Barks is

156
00:13:52,305 --> 00:14:00,527
describing the classic west of cinema. With some really, like flo language about des autos and rust and rim lift sheriff.

157
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:20,870
And the Ducktales drive passed Al classic boot hill and then they enter a small western town where the narration box abruptly halt to let them investigate a wanted poster that promises two thousand dollars for the capture of the gain of rust that are now cleaning out what we learn is bullet Valley. And one nephew you mentions

158
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:25,115
thinking that he thought cattle wrestlers only came to life in the movies.

159
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:28,866
And this is the part where Donald actually wink at the audience

160
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:36,630
and he informs them of his intention to collect that reward stating that he's seen enough western movies to know all the angles.

161
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:42,325
And we get a quick initial look at bullet Al, which really is straight out of the movies.

162
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:44,720
The both Al great

163
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,956
I love the little things in the sides, the

164
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:51,912
cow running and then a random gun just lying somewhere

165
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:53,090
in the dirt.

166
00:14:53,703 --> 00:14:55,998
Is is a great depiction of this law

167
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:59,047
tough value that people live in. Yeah.

168
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:03,155
Alright. And so Donald goes in to meet the sheriff of bullet Al.

169
00:15:03,848 --> 00:15:25,469
And he strides in confidently and tells him that he'd like to clean out those wrestlers for him. The sheriff seems to be a very relaxed man with a sleepy look who favors a pipe. He tells Donald, these rust are a job for the Us marines. But Donald isn't discouraged, and he describes a bunch of scenarios that Hollywood heroes like sage brush, savage,

170
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:31,044
wild bill carson and trigger true shot used to capture the bad

171
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:34,417
again, claiming that it's all in knowing the angles.

172
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:41,837
And the sheriff decides to take him on. And Eric, I can't figure out, you know, if the sheriff was like humor him

173
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:44,630
because he thinks it's gonna be harmless,

174
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:52,590
or if he's looking to have a little bit of fun with him, i can't quite place a beat on it because the sheriff seems like a very, like kind

175
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:54,128
understanding man, you know?

176
00:15:54,687 --> 00:16:15,054
I get the sense that he's just two rooms saying listen them but everything you want you wanna try, go for it. And obviously, can't convince you to not do it, so here run with it. Yep. And so as Donald is sworn in as Deputy sheriff. The the sheriff counsel him that he's gonna have to get evidence on these rust, and they'll need to catch some red hand.

177
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:22,971
Donald reference is Ram rod Ram Branson, catching them with their brand and irons in the fire in gunfire on the Rio,

178
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:27,083
and he rides off on on an incredibly fat horse

179
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:30,655
and contrary to what the narration box says.

180
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:36,269
The sleepy inhabitants of bullet valley are totally dis in the new deputy,

181
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,629
as they mentioned that the previous four never came back.

182
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:40,943
And

183
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:48,489
he's gonna disappoint Huey, dewey and Louie by telling them that they need to get a room at the hotel and keep out of his way. And as he leaves

184
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:53,164
town, he comes to a sign post that tells us about some of the local ranches,

185
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,980
which includes the double x outfit.

186
00:16:56,434 --> 00:16:58,411
Which has been the one that's complaining

187
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:01,942
loudest of of theft. So he goes there first.

188
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,276
And as a fan of western and of

189
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:11,109
this important that on on this side, they show different brands of each range.

190
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:18,260
The brands being such an important part of Western of people been identify which catalog theirs and

191
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:21,875
very distinct that it's a very very common plant devices.

192
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:22,775
So

193
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:23,988
many

194
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:28,478
western is the type of brand that branches have.

195
00:17:29,076 --> 00:17:35,738
Right. Exactly. And this is a neat little bit of universe build Or we we learn about the diamond ranch in the w ranch

196
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:36,656
and

197
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:38,412
one that I can't pronounce?

198
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:51,542
So Donald rides for a while and half on Al alone un branded calf in a stream. He hurts it along intending to lead it to a cow when he comes upon a tough looking cowboy

199
00:17:52,001 --> 00:18:10,535
who draws a gun on him and accuses him of stealing the cat. Donald introduces himself as the new deputy protest that it was un branded, but the man demands that he rides to the calf other side where Donald is shocked to see the Double x brand. So Eric, this is our first look at

200
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:14,195
Black snake. And tell tell me what you think about him.

201
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,390
Oh, he is your pro

202
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:31,015
villain. The minute you see it on screen, you gonna like, yep. That's the bad guy. No matter what they say, what they do? Yes. That is the bad guy. Yeah. He's got a literal black hat. Right? He's always got a cigarette in his mouth.

203
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:41,615
And and Donald has no idea initially, but we know he's a villain right away. Boy, this this Western scenery that Donald is riding through. Sure. Sure is beautiful.

204
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:45,975
Yeah. It's very picturesque. Alright. So the man ins

205
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:51,503
the Donald is just posing as a deputies so he can russell cattle and he mentions

206
00:18:52,160 --> 00:19:02,965
catching previous deputies also stealing caps. Just then one of his fellow Cowboys tells the man that Donald horse and saddle look like his as well.

207
00:19:03,485 --> 00:19:04,905
And he promptly

208
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:09,816
identifies them. Again, by the brand before threatening to shoot Donald.

209
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:15,490
This is this is a great setup for the mystery of like, where what's gonna happen? What's the device how's that going on?

210
00:19:16,065 --> 00:19:19,265
Because you can go back look through the comma. And say, no. That horse was brandon, but now it is.

211
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:23,125
What's the trick? I think it's a great way to pull the audience in as to

212
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:24,545
give a mystery epic to solve.

213
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:35,872
Yeah. That's that's a good point. Right? Because if you're the reader, you you definitely have the luxury of going back to check and and I definitely did. I assume you did as well.

214
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:36,791
Sure.

215
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:51,360
Right. So the reader gets really drawn in because they know that definitely wasn't there before. Alright. And so Donald is very rattled by what's going on. And he leaps down to go on foot to clear things up with the sheriff in town.

216
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:55,955
And the man we we find out, he's he is black snake mc.

217
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:03,677
He does let him leave and he tells him to tell the sheriff to stop his deputies from stealing livestock.

218
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:08,481
And Donald walks through the brush pondering this mysterious mix up.

219
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:14,255
And this is the part where he's gonna start smelling a plot that's right out of his favorite movies.

220
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:23,850
In particular, the one where Horace mustang jailed hundreds of innocent men before he discovered that the leader of the rust was his kindly old grandmother.

221
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:38,820
And meanwhile, we cut back to black snake who's gang is eyeing the fat steer in the nearby diamond ranch and is lee planning to pay old jim diamond to visit. I wanna see the movie Fa fangs.

222
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,660
That sounds like great great movie.

223
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,035
Yeah. That sounds awesome some I and I thought that was hilarious his description of that movie

224
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:55,900
about the kindly old grandmother. And right away the at this one, I I like how Barks is bringing us in on black snakes, you know,

225
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:58,315
conversations, his scheming.

226
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:07,935
We we don't know explicitly yet that he's the villain even though as the reader we can tell, but I I really like this sort of parallel development.

227
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:18,701
Yeah. It's it's nice that they're using this bill, but they're also not giving away how he does right. So it's still a mystery to get solved later on. To keep the reader and suspense. Alright. So on the next page,

228
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,780
Donald

229
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:22,816
decides to delay heading back into town

230
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:29,790
due to him being suspicious of the sheriff. And so his hike takes him to the diamond ranch

231
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:41,495
where he meets the previously mentioned old gym. Who is a a very agreeable rancher who knows a little bit about Barks snake. Donald tells him about the mix up with the calf and his horse.

232
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:48,011
And old Jim Vows that Barks snake better not try to find his brand on any of his cattle.

233
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:58,382
And just then black snake and this gang arrived on horse back and I I really like this little panel where they arrive. I find it, you know, very men.

234
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,946
Oh, it's fantastic. You can see them telling up five riders in a distance with their guns drawn

235
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:15,196
and the look of shock and of surprise on old jim Diamond and Donald gives you... Everything you need to know is like, oh oh, this is trouble.

236
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,650
Right. I find this really

237
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:22,608
cinematic, like, I can I can hear the sound effects. The who's stopping

238
00:22:23,982 --> 00:22:25,279
clapping when I read this.

239
00:22:25,616 --> 00:22:29,878
Yep. I can hear the... I can hear the soundtrack swelling right now, because there's gonna be a standoff.

240
00:22:30,374 --> 00:22:39,261
Right. Alright. So Donald, an old gym noticed the very men thing sub submachine guns that black snake gang is packing.

241
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:41,893
And when he arrives

242
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:43,767
on an absolutely

243
00:22:44,304 --> 00:22:45,540
livid looking horse,

244
00:22:46,195 --> 00:22:47,455
black snake points

245
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:56,546
at Jim's herd and he claims to wanna look at them to verify that they aren't his stolen steer, carrying the Double x brand. And

246
00:22:57,362 --> 00:23:06,090
he he's he demands it and he snips his way through Jim's fence who's just fuming, but he allows him to too because he's confident he has nothing to hide.

247
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:11,876
But sure enough, black snake gang starts to round up the steer and when Jim protest

248
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:16,122
Points out the Double x brand again on

249
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:17,319
everyone.

250
00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:23,597
Yes. So that instant, okay. There's a gag here. Is you getting his brand on so many things so fast.

251
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:26,468
And it's it's been

252
00:23:27,444 --> 00:23:30,097
it's interesting that this is the only thing they're using as

253
00:23:32,326 --> 00:23:33,244
the proof... I mean,

254
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,179
really back in Western, they would have

255
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:40,185
certification Al how big cattle was. They record their Birthday log

256
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:43,578
all those things that they have is how many had they had. So

257
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,294
I mean, ideally,

258
00:23:45,752 --> 00:23:48,506
and this is the the little thing product. So I don't mean to do that. Ideally,

259
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,992
if Mc were to come into this valley and establish a ranch,

260
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:55,104
they would have document and how many head a cat had,

261
00:23:55,703 --> 00:24:01,011
so they could know wait you've got way more than you should have. But again, this is this is a western

262
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,047
Right. So all those small towns stuff. It's it's not always

263
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:09,330
well documented it in the in historically.

264
00:24:10,027 --> 00:24:11,523
That's exactly what a podcast

265
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,085
is for. Right, to to nerd out over the little

266
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:18,005
Al little trivia and and player

267
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:23,245
inconsistencies. Right? Because we know that, you know, he has to take some liberties

268
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:28,331
with this. And and if you really examine the plot, it would fall apart, but

269
00:24:28,748 --> 00:24:36,282
it's fun to have this. It it is fun. It i... To me it works very well under its own like, tight definition.

270
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:39,352
Alright. So

271
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:41,027
old gym

272
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,080
is

273
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:49,700
outraged. But when he approaches sure enough, he is totally flu to see black snake brand on all of his peers.

274
00:24:50,354 --> 00:24:54,491
And black snake implies that he could have jim jailed for wrestling.

275
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:02,897
But Jim pro that he's innocent, any he demands to know where his years could be black snake dis this is not his problem,

276
00:25:03,356 --> 00:25:05,953
but rather it's deputy Donald problem.

277
00:25:06,513 --> 00:25:11,182
And so Donald then old Jim ponder, you know, what's going on?

278
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:15,951
I I like the diamond jim just in confused Al the audience is what?

279
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:18,266
Doesn't that makes sense. How is he doing this?

280
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:29,648
Yeah. And and I really feel for Diamond Jim, You know, He's really well drawn, and I just... I feel like I get a a good idea of his character. Again, just a decent rancher

281
00:25:30,225 --> 00:25:31,403
trying to do right,

282
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:36,109
who is totally Al a loss in this situation?

283
00:25:37,657 --> 00:25:44,433
So I think in this story Barks does a really nice job of developing these side characters with a very little time.

284
00:25:46,363 --> 00:25:47,661
So Donald is

285
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,540
dis

286
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:49,897
of Jim

287
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:50,735
and

288
00:25:51,113 --> 00:26:04,240
he his his instincts aren't exactly right on. And he asked gym if he has any other steer. And Jim tells him about another herd that consists of rescued range steer that he's comb out of the hills.

289
00:26:04,695 --> 00:26:07,150
That are hidden in a box cannon in behind his homestead.

290
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:20,810
Donald sounds him out about who else works the ranch. And when Jim says that it's just him there, Donald Lasso him and he ties him to a post telling him that he's under arrest for cattle wrestling.

291
00:26:22,024 --> 00:26:25,300
What do you what do you think about Donald instincts here, Eric?

292
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:32,679
I think he's hedging his bets. He's like, you know I can't be sure. I'm an air in the side of caution

293
00:26:33,295 --> 00:26:34,690
because I saw movie about this once.

294
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:37,502
And I'm gonna tie him up and

295
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:40,992
It he isn't too bad, if he is, then I stopped him.

296
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,350
Yeah.

297
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,485
You know, something else that I like about this one as I read it.

298
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,720
Again, is just the little micro geography,

299
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,960
you know, of

300
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:57,575
these little places in this canyon that's behind the the ranch it feels very, like, lived into to me.

301
00:26:57,915 --> 00:27:03,748
Yeah. It's it's well developed for area wise for the the whole geography and build up in the...

302
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:05,583
How the Al set up?

303
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:09,471
Yeah. The Al feels like feels like a place to me.

304
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:20,240
After lashing jim to the post, Donald does locate the three hundred head of cattle in the box canyon, and he makes note of their diamond brand, so we get see that.

305
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:27,211
He surmise then that Jim hid his thin steer in the canyon so that he could replace them.

306
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:32,287
With black snakes heard and that the sheriff must also be in on it.

307
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:36,109
Meanwhile, we go to the nephews who have taken Donald car

308
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:41,134
determined not to let their uncle be the only one having fun.

309
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:45,855
Tell me what you think on this, but I definitely wanna hear what you think about the Nephews driving off.

310
00:27:47,153 --> 00:27:50,210
Well, first off, I wanna say this in these scenes visually,

311
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:58,000
they make a very specific effort. He makes very specific effort to show them the Diamond brand and all the cattle and on the horse.

312
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,435
So obviously, the brands are important and he's using that as a... He's been then the background so you notice some.

313
00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:08,635
But, of course, the net driving off the tom's car. I just...

314
00:28:09,135 --> 00:28:17,260
Alright. Well, pete i'll else i here. Let's go for a drive. That's so fantastic. These guys are good Barks at ten years old. Right. For writing this car,

315
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:24,495
you'll look for. And no one questions him. I was I was impressed when I said go get a hotel room you stay there. Like.

316
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:32,564
Okay, guys. I'm gonna go fight crime. You be responsible for yourselves Yeah. Like, what a poor poor jobs is an uncle?

317
00:28:33,602 --> 00:28:39,111
And to be fair, I think there's just some expectation that he knows how independent his nephews can be.

318
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:46,725
That's that's true, but but still. I'm gonna say this isn't the first time and keep taking this car for Ride. Probably not.

319
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:52,786
So the nephews ponder that they are gonna avoid Donald while they scout for

320
00:28:53,124 --> 00:29:00,015
rust in bullet valley. And meanwhile Donald is trailing black snake, but as he approaches his ranch,

321
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:06,918
a warning shot fires from a lookout, and that stops him from crossing the past that separates

322
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,252
black snakes.

323
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:14,715
And that random shot of the car with the bunnies in the foreground is just absolutely

324
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,355
fantastic. Yeah.

325
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:18,715
Yeah. I love that. Those

326
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,355
prolific bunnies

327
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:28,450
And and again, a little bit of, like, this sort of micro geography where we know that black snake is hiding something

328
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,185
because

329
00:29:29,842 --> 00:29:32,215
the past, the only pass into his

330
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,146
his lair is guarded.

331
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:35,602
Alright. And

332
00:29:36,337 --> 00:29:36,837
so

333
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:56,725
the lookout is using a walkie talkie, which must have been the height of technology at the time based on how donald reacts. To summon black snake, and then he hides behind the pass, while Black snake is talking with Donald. And so Donald is telling Black snake that he's figured out how Jim Dim stole his steer,

334
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:57,603
and

335
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:02,491
the hidden look out is just like beside himself with silent laughter.

336
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,104
Well while Donald is is revealing things to black snake. And

337
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:16,770
as he reveals this so called steam. Donald slips that Jim has another herd of hidden steer and black snake,

338
00:30:17,703 --> 00:30:24,165
is, you know, very excited dear this, and he yet again points out the Double x brand on Donald horse.

339
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:27,796
Who looks just as surprised as Donald is.

340
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:32,205
Yes. This is the second time Donald had that trick pulled on him and

341
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:37,488
we'll see how the things to that. If he gets finally gets suspicious or not. Right.

342
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:41,396
Yeah. I I feel like Barks snake is really pushing his leg here.

343
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:44,447
I also really like the artist that Barks.

344
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:51,515
I guess, more of the the composition that Barks has done in having this, like

345
00:30:52,374 --> 00:30:57,709
conversation from these two perspectives. Right, Don conversation with Barks snake, and then the

346
00:30:58,128 --> 00:31:00,626
the the Hen listening in

347
00:31:01,498 --> 00:31:04,871
and seeing these different reactions, you know, the

348
00:31:05,648 --> 00:31:07,106
black snake kind of

349
00:31:07,523 --> 00:31:10,670
silently trying to to keep from laughing

350
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:16,580
and then the hen just just busting up with. He he still asked to be quiet, but he can

351
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:17,739
visually

352
00:31:18,198 --> 00:31:21,374
show his his reaction. I think this is really

353
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,630
that's that's good job. That's good artwork work right there.

354
00:31:24,324 --> 00:31:25,023
Alright. And

355
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:40,910
Donald again bog at how this brand keeps appearing. And when Barks snake finds it on his saddle too, he threatens to fill Donald full of let. However, his hen talks him down because he calls Donald so dumb that he's useful.

356
00:31:41,404 --> 00:31:42,981
And black snake,

357
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:46,532
you know, he unleashes the old western cliche

358
00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:48,585
of making him dance.

359
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:59,214
By shooting at his feet. Donald walks away nursing his feet, sour black snake grumpy attitude while black snake prepares to rust the diamond steer.

360
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:03,064
And Al that moment Huey, dewey and Louis arrive at the diamond ranch.

361
00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:06,736
Oh, yeah. Make them dance. That's that's that's very typical.

362
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,370
Best version of that

363
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,630
back to the future three.

364
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:24,055
Yeah. That's the one that comes to my mind too. And I have to admit, I can't think of a time when it was done straight. Right? Like, I can only think of it being done as a parody or, you know, referencing what gets done.

365
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:35,172
Only in the later one. So I would oh, no back in the day it was very common just feed and seconds and watch them hop and then the left. If it was usually done

366
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,050
at,

367
00:32:36,428 --> 00:32:42,690
like, the Quaker type characters who were not violence, and didn't have a gun on them anyway, but it was just a way to

368
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:51,150
bully and menace them. Yeah. Know it oftentimes in front of the whole gang Right. That way, the the victim would feel extra shame and gil.

369
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:58,025
And I I think that some of these western cliches, you know, they happened all the time in, like, the really pull

370
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:09,182
Tv ones and sort of a Saturday Mat New ones, but I don't think they really come up that much whereas much. And, like, the ones that are really remembered, you know, the old east woods.

371
00:33:11,671 --> 00:33:13,247
No. In in those areas

372
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,740
not so much is very much and the what he's what the movies that Donald is referencing.

373
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,060
Are those

374
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,835
po Saturday mat Ones where it's, you know, the same

375
00:33:23,455 --> 00:33:25,575
five plots every two weeks.

376
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:28,395
Yeah. I feel like the John Wayne stuff

377
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:29,850
would have

378
00:33:30,268 --> 00:33:33,994
already been kind of more on the cutting edge. Right? Like Barks is probably

379
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:44,719
referencing stuff that's kind of classic even Al at this time. So probably he's he's probably thinking more of like, late thirties early forties these stuff. Oh, yeah. Definitely

380
00:33:45,095 --> 00:33:48,184
help cassie with Cisco kid those types.

381
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,734
Alright. So upon investigating

382
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:52,064
the Nephews

383
00:33:52,403 --> 00:33:59,755
discover gym tied to the post, and they asked to hear his story before they're gonna agree to turn him loose and allow him to go to the sheriff.

384
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:07,800
Jim explains to them his side of the story. And the nephews indicate that they really wanna believe him that they can't trust him until they establish it.

385
00:34:08,773 --> 00:34:11,626
Jim asks him to verify that the Canyon...

386
00:34:12,003 --> 00:34:15,831
The the Canyon herd is still there and still bear the Diamond brand.

387
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,528
I love the reasonable

388
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:26,510
to nephew going like, well, I mean, they seem in trouble like, wait. Why is he tied up? They asked that question They tell him mike he tells them okay. We're looking for rust.

389
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:32,220
Of them must have done per reason. We don't know. We're gonna get more information before we do anything for sure

390
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:33,898
because they don't wanna get in trouble

391
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:37,629
and they wanna make sure they're they're being safe And I appreciate that.

392
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:40,905
Right. Yeah. They're incredibly level headed for

393
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:43,322
three kids who have just taken a car.

394
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:53,095
They're they're not even worried about the about taking the car. Like, although the bone gonna get back and see that we took the car when on and down, like, they doesn't even phase them i love it.

395
00:34:53,908 --> 00:34:56,679
Right. They probably got enough experience to know that

396
00:34:57,015 --> 00:35:00,561
he'll overlook Al once they inevitably save his hide. Yeah.

397
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:02,435
Alright. So

398
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:11,330
after establishing that the herd is safe. The boys learn from Jim about Barks snake. You know, we get a a little bit of nice kind of natural background.

399
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:17,185
He is apparently new to the area and has made camp in the flats beyond Rocky pass

400
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:24,885
and and they find out about what happens when he finds his brand on other Ranchers steer. And the ponder this mystery,

401
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:43,807
when they realized that black snake and his writers have suddenly arrived. And they they engage... You wanna tell us about the quick thinking that they do here. Well, the they realize they have to hide and there's no place too hide. So it's the typical let's jump, Huey,. Well, it's vary the that's buried the rancher

402
00:35:44,304 --> 00:35:49,948
and hide with him so we can stay safe. Yeah. I like this. Is this something that you've seen done

403
00:35:50,366 --> 00:35:51,722
in in any of the classics?

404
00:35:52,494 --> 00:35:56,063
Someone tied up being thrown in the Huey,, no but hiding the Huey,? Absolutely.

405
00:35:57,117 --> 00:36:05,128
Right. No. I like that purring normal. I like that part where you're captive, You know, you don't have time un tie him. So I I thought that was a neat touch.

406
00:36:05,545 --> 00:36:05,864
Yeah.

407
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:08,318
I love the geography too

408
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:15,034
and the flats beyond Rocky pass because it's a past to the rocks. So what else are you're gonna call it? Rocky brands.

409
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:33,056
Yeah. Again, it feels very lived in. Alright. So they hear black snake talk about taking Jim steer. And they figured that that's enough proof to un gym. But they know that they still need more evidence against Barks snake. So they set up above the Canyon intending to spy as

410
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,070
drives away a heard of diamond cattle.

411
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:42,050
But again, they're astonished to see that each steer now bears the double x brand.

412
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,402
I really like the panel where they're just

413
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:47,160
overwhelmed with puzzle

414
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:53,008
Al as both gym and the Nephews are like, how does that brand get there?

415
00:36:53,747 --> 00:36:54,846
So confusing.

416
00:36:55,345 --> 00:37:01,455
Alright. So at this point, the group split up, Jim is gonna head to town to get the sheriff while the kids investigate

417
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:09,950
the bottom and the top of the canyon. And up on top, they see what resembles tank tracks, which is their only clip.

418
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,950
Alright. And this just been back into the whole branding issue

419
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,765
because when the rust would

420
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:25,596
Russell cattle, they would be random them. That's why the shape of the brand is important they would put the new brand or the old brand. And that's me like, oh, no. That brand's burned on, which they always are.

421
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,590
The way to

422
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,910
prove it is to kill one of the steer

423
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,430
and skin it

424
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,923
because the cattle is branded

425
00:37:35,459 --> 00:37:36,676
when they're young,

426
00:37:37,212 --> 00:37:38,230
that brand

427
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:40,979
grows and so they're scar, there's tissue

428
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:49,810
So when russ come log in re random them, they then skin where the brand is, and they can see that it's the the the old scars out there so they can prove.

429
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:52,362
That that cattle has been b.

430
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,914
But I think the confusion and this one is

431
00:37:56,332 --> 00:37:58,987
how did they do this so quickly? Because it takes

432
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:01,334
so much time and effort to do that.

433
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:05,582
Right? Yeah I I appreciate that little gruesome detail.

434
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:08,692
I didn't know about branding and proving

435
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:10,065
cattle fidelity.

436
00:38:11,243 --> 00:38:14,060
But... yeah, I think the whole premise behind black snake

437
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,751
plot here, right is that no one's gonna check too hard if everything

438
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:22,911
if if you if you can believe your eyes. Right?

439
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:23,831
U

440
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:25,963
Alright. So the nephews

441
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,677
follow the tracks

442
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:36,149
of this vehicle until they intersect with black snake and his gang and the herd driving toward Rocky gas. And meanwhile

443
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:43,601
Donald has been on foot. Right? This this most of this time. So he settles down to rest in the near vicinity,

444
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:44,635
and

445
00:38:45,174 --> 00:38:46,873
exhausted he snooze

446
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:55,598
as first, the three hundred Stolen steer, then old Jim Diamond and finally is use past him unnoticed

447
00:38:56,337 --> 00:38:56,837
below.

448
00:38:57,215 --> 00:39:03,538
And the Nephews arrive at the past and they decide to approach cautious thinking that it looks like a good spot for Al ambush.

449
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:06,034
Yep. And the nephew always being reasonable,

450
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:08,726
and someone falling to asleep on lookout duty.

451
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,960
So typical.

452
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:17,660
Yeah. Although I do feel some sympathy for Donald. Right? He's he's been without horse for for much of this.

453
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:30,240
Yeah. He said a rough, I'm not knocking him falling asleep. I'm just saying it's cliche shake, very you used. It makes me think of the movie the John Wayne movie sons of Katie there were they're kind of the whole thing

454
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:44,246
stem the whole conflict between, the two groups stems from a young kid falling asleep and waking up during look lookout dude and taking a shot at somebody else and get killed because of it because, you know, don't sleep on look out duty. Yeah.

455
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,280
Alright. So

456
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:58,403
the nephews climbed at the top of the pass and gazing at the value below they're able to see thousands of cattle. Far more than the few had the black snake was said to have started with.

457
00:39:58,781 --> 00:40:08,895
And approaching the hideout out, they spot a large vehicle with padded wheels and what looks like a double x antenna that seems to have made the tread that they follow.

458
00:40:09,894 --> 00:40:12,725
And getting a closer look, they decide that it's

459
00:40:13,584 --> 00:40:18,999
suspicious enough to take it to the sheriff. And as they do this is they engage in a little more,

460
00:40:20,536 --> 00:40:20,896
hijacking,

461
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:28,691
black snake and his gang are discussing breaking their camp and leaving Bullet valley the next day because there's nothing left to steal.

462
00:40:29,305 --> 00:40:35,199
And then when they see that their jeep has been stolen, they opened fire on it. So apparently, the nephews

463
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:41,361
taking a drawer right was not actually just goofy fun, but it's a plot device instead of this fact later on.

464
00:40:41,698 --> 00:40:42,717
Yeah. It

465
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:47,561
it establishes the what they are capable of and and that they can do this.

466
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:49,754
Alright. So the Nephews

467
00:40:50,172 --> 00:41:00,712
are able to plow past black snake hen and leave through the past as fast as possible with black snake and men and pursuit looking to recover the evidence that could send them to the pen.

468
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:10,830
And eventually, the Nephews meet up with old gym and the sheriff with a policy of men, By this time, the nephews have figured out that the jeep is equipped with a ray gun

469
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:20,620
ray or radar gun that beams heat through the Double x antenna on the roof, and it can brand livestock or anything else at a great distance

470
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,072
and they demonstrate this on a nearby tree.

471
00:41:23,885 --> 00:41:25,702
Of mystery is solved.

472
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:26,599
Yeah.

473
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:32,927
And and I remember as a kid reading this and just, you know, loving this mechanism.

474
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:35,615
For for how this was accomplished.

475
00:41:36,192 --> 00:41:40,898
I really like the sheriff's comment during the dana radar and tan.

476
00:41:41,576 --> 00:41:48,166
And then mom yeah. We'll wonders never see. Yeah. Just... You have it's a little poke you down and the got.

477
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:52,141
You got technology it is. Can believe me a little the boy Yep.

478
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:59,253
Alright. And so the Nephews and the sheriff pos are gonna decide to set up an ambush for black snake,

479
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:00,670
Group.

480
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:08,008
But they happen to be underneath Donald resting spot. And as he wakes up, he's processing the situation

481
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,739
he doesn't see the nephews.

482
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:16,551
He d introduces that an innocent black snake is about to ride into the crooked sheriff's ambush.

483
00:42:17,045 --> 00:42:25,376
I like donald, you know, explains that even though I hate him, I can't let him get shot. Right. Yeah. His hard is in the right place even if his brain isn't.

484
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:41,182
So Donald warns the villain and the sheriff loses some of the element of surprise. And as the pos opens fire, it's seems like the outlaw are gonna escape, but the nephews turn the tide of the the battle by aiming the branding ray on the criminals.

485
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:43,896
Burning their butts, knocking them out of the saddle,

486
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:47,771
every double x rider gets apprehended

487
00:42:48,071 --> 00:42:53,711
except for black snake, the leader of the gang, who does make it to cover. And how do you know their x writers?

488
00:42:54,683 --> 00:42:57,576
It got the brand on them. Yeah. It

489
00:42:57,913 --> 00:43:00,368
it all comes around. In the end

490
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,497
all you couldn't resist.

491
00:43:05,269 --> 00:43:10,325
This is great. You know, i love I love the sequence of the Nephew

492
00:43:10,864 --> 00:43:12,922
turning the the ray on

493
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:20,236
frying their butts from a distance them leap out. This is this is exciting. This is funny. This is some of the best.

494
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:27,331
It is. I just have questions about how the rate works when it's just an antenna. Like, there's no directional quotient or targeting

495
00:43:27,828 --> 00:43:37,811
apparatus on this thing that's just spinning on the top. Just have to know which side is the front which side is the back to shoot it? It's it's fantastic. There's no up or down on I can just shoot straight, but it hits like

496
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,645
elevated and, you know, up and that. It's great. It's great science fiction.

497
00:43:43,264 --> 00:43:43,464
Right.

498
00:43:44,103 --> 00:43:47,970
You're right. You pointed out. It doesn't seem to have the kind of like z axis

499
00:43:48,904 --> 00:43:57,947
yaw whatever you would need to brand's steer from the top of a canyon, but But again, I'm gonna forgive it because to me, this is just very tightly

500
00:43:58,284 --> 00:44:01,232
constructed within it's own own it's absolutely fantastic.

501
00:44:01,845 --> 00:44:09,226
Alright. So the sheriff attempts to explain the situation to Donald who still believes him to be the wrestler.

502
00:44:09,721 --> 00:44:12,261
He dismiss the ray machine as nonsense,

503
00:44:12,601 --> 00:44:14,981
you know, probably having missed its use

504
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:17,401
in the chaos of the fight.

505
00:44:18,294 --> 00:44:25,781
And then the nephews are just noting that when Donald is this stubborn, there'll only be one way to convince him. And so they they

506
00:44:26,478 --> 00:44:33,772
mark a Double x right on his stubborn but instantly making him a believer. And I'm sure they don't mind doing it at all,

507
00:44:35,182 --> 00:44:37,876
Yeah. I think they probably took a little bit of re in that.

508
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:47,623
Alright. So we transition to later that night when the pos returns with bad news. They've lost track of black snake at the edge of the badlands

509
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:51,933
where it is nearly impossible to track him. And then the sheriff

510
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:57,819
says he kind of gloom in tones that it's his duty to go after black snake.

511
00:44:58,398 --> 00:45:04,071
One of one of the members tells him it's a suicide mission, but the sheriff feels duty bound.

512
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:08,811
And Donald is just wrapped with guilt that this mess is his fault.

513
00:45:09,386 --> 00:45:24,276
So a short time later, there's a commotion of the corral, and it turns out to have been donald who hijacked the sheriff's horse and went to make the arrest in his s. And the whole sheriff guinea for a fatal ride is just so western

514
00:45:25,455 --> 00:45:29,849
But the line, tell my folks remember me when the bloom is on the sage.

515
00:45:30,768 --> 00:45:31,268
So

516
00:45:31,767 --> 00:45:35,738
western poetic Yeah. Yeah. It's that great Cowboy poetry.

517
00:45:36,577 --> 00:45:39,794
I really feel, you know, Mcdonald's like Anguish

518
00:45:40,253 --> 00:45:40,993
in that

519
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:42,291
circular panel.

520
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:47,397
Where he's just just feeling so terrible. Yeah. And we get another

521
00:45:47,895 --> 00:45:51,967
one of the nice, like, nighttime silhouette panels that Barks seems to like to do.

522
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:53,561
Alright. And

523
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:56,441
again, some great

524
00:45:56,981 --> 00:45:59,821
sense of place as the next morning.

525
00:46:00,316 --> 00:46:07,196
At the dawn of the next morning, we transitioned to the badlands, which is this very men place full of fearsome wildlife.

526
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,789
And we see black snake Mc

527
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:12,665
driving his horse, like a man possessed.

528
00:46:13,363 --> 00:46:20,904
He's got like a fire in his eyes and vows is a violent revenge one down bullet valley. And again, I absolutely

529
00:46:21,562 --> 00:46:30,014
believe him. And we see Donald hot on Barks snakes trail determined to redeem himself because he doesn't want the kids to tease him for the rest of his days.

530
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:42,899
And so he sykes himself up for an ar person suit, but he's shocked to realize that he has the drop on black snake who is facing away from him letting his horse take water. This is one of my favorite

531
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:43,737
sequences

532
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:51,896
in all of Barks comics with a villain. I just think that this is composed so perfectly because again, this in this panel,

533
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:52,896
I

534
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:59,376
have no doubt that he wants to do exactly what he's gonna say. This is just one of the, like, hardest

535
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:03,403
most vicious villains I think Barks has ever created.

536
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:08,812
And I feel like he's created such a nice sense of like this

537
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,585
you know, per pursuit.

538
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,702
This is the point in the western

539
00:47:13,441 --> 00:47:15,180
where the heroes Al is lowest.

540
00:47:15,718 --> 00:47:18,571
And and he's become like the lone man now at this point. Right?

541
00:47:19,531 --> 00:47:38,821
Yeah. The loan man is out to just for vengeance now not for profit for anything else. I just wanna get back to the people who ruined my plans. Now, Mark, I wanna bring into this... I wanna make great attention to the aspect of him riding away with the sn and then right below it is a nice contrast to Donald chasing him. Yeah. Just it's a it's a neat

542
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:41,321
contrast of how they are him, you know, black snake.

543
00:47:42,014 --> 00:47:48,356
Heavy on the heavy and whipping horse and, you know, the horse is angry. Donald is hopeful and resolute.

544
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:54,504
But and the horse is determined as well. And and I love the contrast of the villain is

545
00:47:54,922 --> 00:48:02,716
primarily colored in red, but, you know, the red saddle, the red rains, the red shirt, it's very prominent. And Donald is right, the blue

546
00:48:03,016 --> 00:48:11,324
saddle, the blue reins and the big blue prominent hat give you nice contrast of, you know, good guy bad guy. Yeah. It is a good choice on the color part.

547
00:48:12,102 --> 00:48:28,183
Barks wouldn't have how to say in that, but I'm sure that's what he was, you know, imagining as he drew this. And and this, you know, this the page where it's gonna kinda diver. Right? At the... At the end of this page, Donald kinda shocked when it it starts to not play out

548
00:48:28,642 --> 00:48:34,715
like the movies. Right? Because You know usually, you don't, usually get the drop on the bad guy like this. So

549
00:48:35,135 --> 00:48:53,286
Donald curse the bad luck that he doesn't get to be a hero and he announces himself startling black snake who reaches for the sky. And black snake here is gonna code donald into whole his guns and drawing from, like an even posture, which is a critical mistake.

550
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,800
Because black snake shoots donald right through his h,

551
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:15,413
and he seems to struck donald with every shot here. Classic, Go shape the guns out, Don't put them away. Yeah. There's a yeah plenty of western where you get the drop on someone and you'll let me get a fair fight have you seen that h trick in any of them? You know, I have it, but it's an easy way

552
00:49:15,792 --> 00:49:16,971
to get around

553
00:49:17,325 --> 00:49:22,825
having a quick drop on test. Yeah. I like that. And and it's... I think we're meant to really

554
00:49:23,165 --> 00:49:26,679
be impacted by that last panel. Right? Because Donald

555
00:49:27,777 --> 00:49:29,995
This is a very convincing looking

556
00:49:30,374 --> 00:49:37,157
panel of Donald being shot to today. Yes, which is imagine especially at the end at the end of the page, and like, what?

557
00:49:37,734 --> 00:49:45,788
Right. Yeah. I'm I I have to guess that it was deliberately paced like that. So you have to turn the page see what happened. Alright. So

558
00:49:46,686 --> 00:50:07,563
black snake walks over Donald body and he's y a cow song and pondering his next move. Donald seems surely dead. He's got an ex over as a visible eye. And there's, like vulture lee Al him in the background. But gradually he does come to... We realized that he's been saved by the old trope of the sheriff's badge,

559
00:50:08,021 --> 00:50:30,055
stopping the bullets. And so he mounts his horse determined to catch black snake against. And when he comes on black snake, he is again easy picking as why wouldn't he be Barks snake thinks that he's killed donald? He them at the Blessings a pretty good shot that have Al his... Oh just hit that giant mother of star autumn. Yeah, especially right through the h.

560
00:50:30,475 --> 00:50:35,348
Alright. So Donald approaches him from behind A rock. And he pretends to haunt him.

561
00:50:35,727 --> 00:50:44,235
But black snake doesn't believe in ghosts, and he toss a live grenade over and past Donald terrified face,

562
00:50:44,615 --> 00:50:47,075
y another song happily as it d.

563
00:50:47,855 --> 00:50:49,276
But Donald is sing

564
00:50:49,615 --> 00:51:02,613
but alive. He tells Barks snake the grenade exploded in a badger hole. And then Donald shoots out the support of a really precarious rock toppling it on black. Name. I think this is my favorite exchange

565
00:51:02,952 --> 00:51:20,004
in this in this comic. This ridiculous fight where they both think they have the other person gender wright and the ridiculous of how to get out of it. Yeah. I agree. This is a great sequence. Right? Because this is like a a very violent fight and it it just because more and more unlikely

566
00:51:20,463 --> 00:51:21,323
and ridiculous.

567
00:51:21,822 --> 00:51:27,696
And I think it's kind of crashing in on Donald fantasy of, you know, how the west is supposed to work.

568
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:35,752
And it's also playing with, like, black snake use of of technology and violence because who brings the grenade,

569
00:51:36,345 --> 00:51:38,418
to their their cattle ranch.

570
00:51:38,977 --> 00:51:40,213
Yeah. I mean, who...

571
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:45,956
Guns were a factor to shoot animals and and things like that, but you've got running ranch,

572
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,750
Why did you ever been grenade?

573
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:57,045
No. Let's take a diet. I'd be more believable, but still grenades fun. Yeah. Alright. So the rocks crash over black snake, and

574
00:51:57,385 --> 00:52:20,266
Donald stands atop the pile he haul him to come out, but black snakes also had a very unlikely stroke of luck as the rocks knocked him through the roof of a cave, you know, as you mentioned, this battle kind of dev evolves into a farce. Black snake can't Donald because he's like being jo around by the fire of his guns, and he can't hit black snake for basically the same reason.

575
00:52:21,118 --> 00:52:21,976
And eventually,

576
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:31,442
Belt buckle breaks under the weight of all the stray bullets that have filled up his pants. And he flee due to his guns being empty.

577
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:40,890
Donald gets the drop on black snape, black snake, who's down to his underwear but then his guns go dry as well. You know, I really liked the

578
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:42,570
Donald comments.

579
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:45,790
That never happened in trigger true shots pictures.

580
00:52:46,285 --> 00:52:47,723
And then when his guns go dry.

581
00:52:48,602 --> 00:52:59,182
My gosh, these things do run dry dante there. I love the line move around, so you'll get in the way of my bullets. But basically he's not best shot he's just like... No. What. Yeah. Everything,

582
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,773
everything written on this page is kind of maximizing

583
00:53:03,685 --> 00:53:08,250
that combination of, like cowboys speak and and humor.

584
00:53:08,627 --> 00:53:34,812
Alright. So Donald pursues black snake on his horse intending to lasso him. And black snakes leaves them to a log over a chasm and he spins them both on that law. But Donald horse is able to keep it up with him. And then suddenly, the horse clamps his hoo tight sending black snake down into the Chasm. Donald catches him with that la. And just for good measure, he turns him into a human yoyo

585
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:39,972
acknowledging that it's not what Rim fire Remington would do, but it is more fun. Yeah.

586
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:44,656
Yeah. And and as I mentioned, you know, it looks like this is something that Barks

587
00:53:45,428 --> 00:53:50,827
really just wanted to repurpose from that story board that he had done in that cartoon.

588
00:53:51,164 --> 00:54:08,361
So it's it's a little silly, but it's fun. Yep. I love the horse being so sure footage. Yeah. It that they're gonna spin Al log above this canyon and with no worries, but the logs spinning out of control and them all falling down. Right. That's our... That's some of our cartoon physics for the for the issue.

589
00:54:08,856 --> 00:54:12,636
And the horse is it's fun how the horses is in this kind of person persona

590
00:54:13,255 --> 00:54:24,465
the the emotions of their writers. It's a nice little comic touch. Well So on the the final page, we've got Donald leading the captured black snake back in the glow of the Western Twilight

591
00:54:25,086 --> 00:54:33,435
Donald ad the colors of Sunset head, but black snake moan that everything looks magenta to him. I assume through his like, black eyes.

592
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:41,705
And then later on, we transitioned to the sheriff deciding that his time for retirement this come and he decides leave his job to a younger

593
00:54:42,045 --> 00:55:04,847
able man Donald Duck. And then we get a fun little epi vlog where a man approaches the sheriff's of office desperate with the news of a Barks robbery, but he stopped by Huey, doing Louie who tell him to simmer down and share if Doug will take care of it just after the show, which turns out to be the newest horse opera at the red Saddle theater where Sheriff duck clearly goes to keep up on the latest western

594
00:55:05,186 --> 00:55:05,545
Shenanigans.

595
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:06,557
Yes.

596
00:55:06,956 --> 00:55:20,326
And I love that messenger falls down and and here... The you see the the p as the messenger falls down and shot the the shifts Al the movies. Right. Yeah. Very classic. So that is the sheriff of Bullet Valley.

597
00:55:21,004 --> 00:55:38,375
You know, I think I I think I've already tipped my hat by just if using on how much I enjoyed so much of this one. But, you know, what do you think Eric, how as a western fan yourself how did this one stack up? What what are your thoughts on it? Oh, I think it's fantastic. I think it's the perfect blend of western

598
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:40,110
tropes, cliches

599
00:55:40,410 --> 00:56:03,965
and donald Ducktales and that Donald still is the fool, but like a true western and he redeem himself and has that one on one showdown with the bad guy, which is fantastic and that you just be a typical gun fight. It becomes this whole scene of Don the mono model, and it's it's fantastic. Yeah. I I completely agree. I think this one is one of Barks masterpieces.

600
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:11,483
It's so tightly paced it's very exciting. It's very funny. It has a fantastic art.

601
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,356
Just a really

602
00:56:13,692 --> 00:56:14,192
vicious

603
00:56:14,664 --> 00:56:39,146
villain with as you said a really great plan and just enough of a mystery to make this just incredibly training. So I I've never really thought before about how I would rank some of these stories, but I'm I'm pretty confident if I sit down and do it, this is gonna be like a top ten or top twenty or so Barks story for me. So I think this is a masterpiece

604
00:56:39,700 --> 00:57:09,052
I'm I'm glad to hear that you really enjoy this one. Any thoughts any other thoughts before I check in on on the general community's opinion of this one? No. Like I said, I think I've I've read this one before and I remember liking in the read read rebate I'm like, wait a minute dead user a ray. Right? Yes. But reading again allowed me to say that look look for those western tropes like yeah, as you said and like... Oh my gosh. Yes. This is referencing that. That's referencing this. And just the the goof of the small town the, you know, at the this

605
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:42,725
city dwell her, green horn coming in to clean up the town because of his knowledge of western and he never shook his stuff in. That he could do it. And I think that's fantastic. Right. Yeah. As you say, this one is best appreciated it if you come in from the perspective of it being like a a love letter to or a meditation on western and on the wild West. It's self. And, you know, our ideas of the Wild west come from Hollywood. So this this is really the perfect way to think about it and to poke some general fun at it. Absolutely.

606
00:57:43,185 --> 00:57:59,759
So the the community agrees with both of us this one is an incredibly well regarded one. As of when I looked it up, this one had had an eight point four out of ten rating on the Index website where we go to look at general consensus. And that was good for fourteenth

607
00:58:00,576 --> 00:58:11,634
overall out of all the nearly forty one thousand Disney comic stories that are rated on dutch So that places this. Yeah. And in the very very highest tier of comics.

608
00:58:12,373 --> 00:58:15,325
So people people love this one. It's

609
00:58:16,345 --> 00:58:34,235
very well remembered very well regarded. And then, you know, as far as reflecting on how well it holds up, this one is an interest one to think about right? Because, like, it is incredibly dated, but it's like dated in a way that's very purposeful and deliberate. Right? It's I feel like he's

610
00:58:34,815 --> 00:59:01,320
already kind of reflecting on those myths of the old west and already acknowledging that they're myths. So like, it's it's hard to... It's hard to accuse this one of being dated because that's kind of the point of it in all way. And even even when you get some of the like technology stuff like the old Fashioned Walkie Talkie, you know, that's still modern technology for the old west in a lot of ways. Well, that that's what makes it Al classic. And, you know,

611
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,620
rewatch some of the movies

612
00:59:06,534 --> 00:59:28,290
that came out back then that were current and modern then. I'm sure people we're like, wow this is very. We have... You know, like, gonna understand this. Looking at it back now, we look at him and say well it's extremely dated because it's very, you know, no cell phones, all this other stuff. No modern convenience is but you look at more as a snapshot of the era. And appreciating it. And like, wow, this is a classic. It helps me understand that era better.

613
00:59:29,009 --> 00:59:42,854
And I think that's what this does. It's because it's so well done and and all that. So I I definitely appreciate it making... And it it is a classic. Yeah. And and the thing is that, like, the the genre of the Western has basically,

614
00:59:43,272 --> 00:59:47,124
like, falling off a cliff. Right? We don't... They're incredibly rare nowadays.

615
00:59:47,661 --> 00:59:53,681
They were at their height of their popularity at a time in history where it kind of made more sense.

616
00:59:54,018 --> 00:59:56,392
And I feel like the genre

617
00:59:56,809 --> 01:00:24,005
it kinda had a limited number of stories to tell. Right? So to me, this is kind of the best way to look at it is is, like, reflecting on it as, you know, what are the ideas that led to the west stern. But but it's fascinating to me how, like, they were so ubiquitous at this time when Barks was writing this love letter to them, and they basically don't exist anymore. No. Not really. There's not many people appreciate good western.

618
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,600
Or know what they referring to and the western aren't. They definitely...

619
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:43,480
Their heyday has passed. And I don't think we will ever see that again. Yeah. And and a big part of... I mean, I think it's very understandable why the Heyday has passed. Right? And And a and a big part of it is just some so many of our ideas of the old west are not

620
01:00:43,938 --> 01:00:47,964
not in fashion anymore. And Oh, this story

621
01:00:48,303 --> 01:00:52,998
is very fortunate too to have avoided some of the like tropes

622
01:00:53,617 --> 01:01:07,955
so much of the horse opera stuff was about Indians. Right? And yeah. And it's it's a it's a relief that he wasn't really interested in that Cowboy and Indian story. He was more interested in that open range cattle wrestling story because

623
01:01:08,575 --> 01:01:17,610
we don't really have to talk about some of the stuff that hasn't Al aged well because again, it it didn't age well in in the same way that noah western

624
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:36,294
sure aged well, but it it's still there's nothing really like that that makes me cringe or that I feel like I have to explain away if I read this to my ten year old. No. Not at all. It's very straightforward. There's a good guy. There's a bad guy. Bad guy gets cool. But yeah. A good guy learns going on.

625
01:01:36,813 --> 01:01:37,930
Ops the bad guy. Yeah.

626
01:01:39,222 --> 01:01:42,993
So as far as appearances and other media go,

627
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:45,605
Barks did have a lit graph.

628
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:51,580
An oil painting based on his cover for this one that I'll have to share with you.

629
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,140
Do you do you have the means to look it up really quick actually?

630
01:01:55,594 --> 01:02:19,625
It's it's just called, I would just Google oil painting sheriff of bullet Al. It's it's really stunning. That's football well. Yeah. So that's that's a great lit graph or oil painting that I know has been used as the cover art for at least one reprint of this one. I don't think that black snake ever been used again, which I think is unfortunate because I again, I thought he was a great villain.

631
01:02:20,158 --> 01:02:25,683
And to my knowledge, you know, they never tried to adapt this for duck tales or anything. As far as

632
01:02:26,021 --> 01:02:37,227
as far as educational value, you know, this one did have some meat kind of western themed vocabulary. It's not the most educational one. But I learned what a c use is from this one.

633
01:02:38,777 --> 01:02:41,710
And there's just some some good sort of cowboy poetry

634
01:02:42,247 --> 01:02:48,211
throughout this one. Well, that is a good painting. Yeah. Yeah. That's a really neat when I like I think the colors really pop.

635
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:56,080
And I love the original cover, that, you know, that's in the adaptation of the cover for this one. There are a ton of really

636
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:00,780
beautiful and cool panels. In this one, many of which we've already talked about,

637
01:03:01,515 --> 01:03:03,655
are there any that really stand out to you?

638
01:03:04,955 --> 01:03:14,211
I'm just trying to look at them. I I really like the intro and it's setting the setting the pace and setting the the scene. Yeah, You talking about the, like, landscape

639
01:03:14,787 --> 01:03:41,187
the landscape. And then I also, like trying to think I'm looking there go like, man, there's just so many. They're really are. That's one of the great things about a western people always talk about this that the old well the hero wrote this. The backdrop and the landscape of western are so important, they're so pretty and it's such beautiful country that you, like, oh, wow. And so I like a lot of these things when they have distant shots and you see things like the nephews,

640
01:03:41,939 --> 01:03:42,439
are

641
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:45,475
watching the cab... This the cattle

642
01:03:46,174 --> 01:03:49,391
Russell is just a nice shot of the geography and everything.

643
01:03:50,385 --> 01:03:51,365
Going to the badlands.

644
01:03:51,865 --> 01:04:02,228
It's just so fantastic. I don't know if there's any one panel that is obviously my favorite. And then the this one is such good artwork in this so many of the the classic Barks silhouette scenes.

645
01:04:03,265 --> 01:04:05,917
Donald leading the leading him back into town

646
01:04:06,254 --> 01:04:09,803
To deal with the sunrise I think it's just very pretty very good artwork work.

647
01:04:10,181 --> 01:04:17,887
So I... It'd be hard pressed Honestly, I probably depend... But... I don't know if it's the panel, but the whole page, we talked about it when they're chasing each other the badlands,

648
01:04:18,306 --> 01:04:19,685
that whole page

649
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:23,521
is amazing. Yeah. I I agree with you. I really

650
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:25,092
keyed then on those

651
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:30,669
panels of black snake vowing retribution. I don't know why those stick with me.

652
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:36,354
But I I really noticed too, there's a lot of great reaction shots just of characters

653
01:04:37,213 --> 01:04:41,839
thinking and and reacting of things, you know, Donald anguish, the sheriff's

654
01:04:42,256 --> 01:04:42,756
resignation,

655
01:04:43,294 --> 01:04:45,908
the sheriff delight Al seeing the Nephews

656
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:48,120
burning the radar

657
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,800
on the bridges of the the rust.

658
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,320
There's a ton of great great art and great sequences.

659
01:04:55,195 --> 01:04:55,695
Yeah.

660
01:04:56,075 --> 01:04:57,335
I I did like the

661
01:04:57,635 --> 01:05:10,275
the slaps factor that they included in this one with Al lot of the reactions with a question Barks, so it's so many federal characters different times. And then, you know, the slaps of them getting burned And the horses,

662
01:05:10,695 --> 01:05:11,195
particularly,

663
01:05:11,535 --> 01:05:14,455
these are not well drawn horses when it comes to a horse.

664
01:05:15,095 --> 01:05:15,855
Right. Very much.

665
01:05:16,509 --> 01:05:25,175
They're very much a cartoon animated horse where they're just got the floppy legs. Right. And it's it's it's so fantastic and keeps that slaps steak color with

666
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:32,326
feel too very well. Yeah. I I've been reread some of the old Mickey floyd got and stories. And I think that

667
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:38,100
cartoon that Barks was working on was originally meant to be a vehicle for

668
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,020
Mickey

669
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:46,235
horse from the comic strip tang foot, which had this, like brief brief little burst of popularity

670
01:05:47,055 --> 01:05:48,155
in the thirties.

671
01:05:49,228 --> 01:05:53,578
I I think that's kind of where some of that humor with the worse might might come from.

672
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:55,913
Yeah So anyway,

673
01:05:56,371 --> 01:06:05,500
we we've had a lot to say about this one. I'll just note before before finishing that at an eight point four, this is the second best

674
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:10,528
rated one out of the storage that we've talked about so far, I think only adventure down under

675
01:06:11,225 --> 01:06:12,820
clicked in a tiny bit higher.

676
01:06:13,274 --> 01:06:17,423
Do you... Eric have any any closing thoughts before we wrap it up?

677
01:06:18,222 --> 01:06:34,155
Know just that it's fantastic and I love it. It sits I think it it's well married in in it's spot as a classic. It's a it's a great comic. It explains itself start to finish it has the resolution it has the explanation, and it's it's an a wonderful o to

678
01:06:34,855 --> 01:06:36,965
western. Which I very much appreciate.

679
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:44,875
Yeah. I totally agree. I love it even as someone who doesn't really care for a western. So great story all around.

680
01:06:45,215 --> 01:06:51,635
Eric, thank you so much for joining me again and thanks to all of our listeners for joining us.

681
01:06:52,055 --> 01:06:59,116
If you have any thoughts or comments, you can drop us Al line at Barks remarks at g mail dot com

682
01:06:59,534 --> 01:07:01,290
or or on the Facebook page.

683
01:07:02,103 --> 01:07:05,637
We have gotten a little bit a couple of our first

684
01:07:06,095 --> 01:07:08,791
email feedback which I was

685
01:07:09,249 --> 01:07:11,106
very pleased to see

686
01:07:11,619 --> 01:07:13,316
So I heard from

687
01:07:14,293 --> 01:07:16,149
Rubin had given me some

688
01:07:16,807 --> 01:07:19,381
feedback on the audio quality

689
01:07:19,854 --> 01:07:22,268
of Christmas on Bear Mountain and

690
01:07:22,885 --> 01:07:29,526
was able to go back and improve some of that. So he had some positive things to say, but I was glad that we could

691
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:35,473
improve the audio quality on that one and I'm I'm always trying to keep that strong going forward.

692
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,265
And then Roger had emailed

693
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:40,743
providing some very kind feedback

694
01:07:41,761 --> 01:07:42,261
and

695
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:43,579
saying that he

696
01:07:43,998 --> 01:07:45,656
routinely was searching

697
01:07:46,608 --> 01:08:03,038
Apple podcasts, I think for Carl Barks podcasts. And the last time he did it was pleased to actually see that one existed. So you know, I promote this on the Carl Facebook group, but I'm glad that people are finding it from other sources as well. So thank you guys for

698
01:08:03,376 --> 01:08:05,927
chi in. I really appreciate it.

699
01:08:06,265 --> 01:08:06,765
And

700
01:08:07,103 --> 01:08:12,330
please join us next time on B Barks when we get to talk about the Golden Christmas tree.
