2
00:00:38,221 --> 00:01:10,155
publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context, and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Just a quick technical note. This episode has a little bit of audio if C I likes to record during part of the beginning of the episode and had to used my backup recording. But midway through my guest audio should improve a lot. Regardless enjoy the episode. Hello, and welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever marino a grown man who still enjoys donald dot con.

3
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:31,606
And I am excited to have a new guest host this time to talk about our circus themed story. Guest host. Please introduce yourself. Hey. I'm Dan Sever Mark's, little little brother. Good to be here. Yeah. Thanks a lot. So you know, I I've been... I've been wanting to get you to join me for a while because

4
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:36,450
I I love to talk about these stories and it's it's a great excuse.

5
00:01:37,104 --> 00:01:51,859
To make people I love, read them. I don't know if you remember me having them litter my room and and the house as we were growing up at all. Oh, definitely, I remember comic box after box, You know, there would be six, seven stacked up on each other.

6
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:59,460
Very fond go through them. Yeah. I was a big fan. I think you and our other brother James read them occasionally.

7
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:05,665
I don't think I ever really got you into them. This one may not be the best one

8
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:06,583
to

9
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:12,135
get someone into reading Carl Barks. It's it's a it's a bit of an unusual one.

10
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:16,334
Today, we're gonna be talking about big top Bed.

11
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:22,249
Which as I mentioned, is a circus themed issue. And

12
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:31,132
Dan, do you have any kind of opening thoughts on the circus or circus in general? Or are are you a fan of the circus?

13
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:32,968
I've personally

14
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,453
don't ever remember it going to this circus

15
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:55,375
even though you told me we went as kids, that's that's about the knowledge I have that. I like certain things like that. Except for the animal part. I I I think Zoos can be fun, but there's always a little bit of guilt going there. That takes away from it. So the animal expert... Long story sure the animal

16
00:02:56,071 --> 00:03:07,507
exploitation can can be a little downer But other than that, you know, the... Everything else sounds like fun. Sure. I think that you're in good company with, you know, the guilt. Over animal

17
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:12,287
exploitation. Right? Because that's that's what's happened in the last few years.

18
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,894
Yeah. No one likes the circus anymore. We had the big

19
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:19,454
ring brothers, Barks and Bailey,

20
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:20,694
whatever basically

21
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:27,103
stopped touring just just a few years ago. Once they got rid of their... Once they stopped using elephants,

22
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:29,394
I think they felt like they were

23
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:32,914
not financially viable. And it's fascinating

24
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:45,309
to me how, like, this was such a huge part of American life for for a long time for like a century. Right? And and and that's the thing that kinda comes across to me and this issue.

25
00:03:45,644 --> 00:03:57,277
Is the excitement when the circus comes to town. If you think about, like pop culture for so long, there was always this kind of issue or this kind of episode. You know, the circus themed

26
00:03:57,815 --> 00:04:00,752
episode of older Tv shows was a thing

27
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:12,679
in a way that just isn't anymore. So, you know, that's something we can think about as we dive into the story. I also think that clowns have pretty much fallen out of fashion in these days too.

28
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,319
I know my kids

29
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,759
are my kids have never found clowns to be anything

30
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:30,608
anything less than horrifying. Maybe that's the fault of Stephen King. I don't know. But again, back back in the fifties, clowns were mischievous and and fun and and accuracy.

31
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:32,206
And it

32
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:38,055
they're just not in fashion. So... Yeah. Let's let's talk about a little bit of the background

33
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:40,094
of big top bed

34
00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:43,509
And this this is a story that came out

35
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:48,065
The cover date is November of nineteen fifty. So dan, I started,

36
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:52,994
you know, the podcast about a half year ago. I've been going through these adventure stories chronological,

37
00:04:53,491 --> 00:05:01,860
we've just gotten into the fifties. Right? So that we're in that post war era here. This was printed in four color number

38
00:05:02,238 --> 00:05:26,520
three hundred, and that probably doesn't mean much to you, but four color is this series of one shots and they would feature a different character every month or so, you might have like, bugs bunny one month or one week and one of the Disney characters. And eventually, Donald Duck is gonna get his own series, but for now, Carl Barks stories are just getting published in the the one shot four color series.

39
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:34,250
I also always like to check out on how many times the story been reprinted because it kinda gives you an idea of the popularity.

40
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:42,692
This one if you count the original printing, this has only been reprinted five times, which is much less, much fewer than

41
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:54,828
most of the stories that I've covered which usually range between like, eight and twelve reprint. So I suspect that this one just doesn't seem that relevant

42
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:56,585
for the for the publishers

43
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:57,424
who

44
00:05:57,763 --> 00:06:04,619
reprint these. Because that's very few over the last what seventy years now? Yeah. This is a twenty eight pager. Pretty average

45
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:05,734
for these

46
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:16,159
stories. And let's a little bit little bit of background trivia. This is one of the last stories that Carl Barks is gonna do that features human looking care.

47
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:26,080
Yeah. I don't know if that stood out to you. But usually, the Barks stories will feature that kind of Disney like dog knows for the background care.

48
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,036
I did notice that with some of the

49
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:33,290
a couple of the people on the street, I believe. Mh.

50
00:06:33,664 --> 00:06:36,914
Yeah. Right. Right. And and and Zip himself

51
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:57,525
is human. And and these characters are all human is kind of the position of Barks. They're just some of them are humans that look like ducks, some Huey, humans that look like dogs. But Al at one point, his publisher basically said stop drawing regular humans it's distracting. Okay. So, yeah. We're we're just a few stories away from that.

52
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:28,914
And then I I noticed looking this one up that the cover first off, he he did not get to draw the cover for this originally. It was done by I think one of the editors carl B. And the cover actually says that it's an animated cover and there were instructions on the inside for how you can make it move. So I don't I don't have any insight on how you actually do that, but a little thing of note. So, Dan, I like to take a little bit of time to kind of pan her to the

53
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,387
international listeners.

54
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:38,150
By mentioning some of the titles from around the world. And let me let me go ahead and drop one in the chat.

55
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:45,877
And if you don't mind, I will ask you to read this one. I'm gonna give you the German title

56
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,490
Go ahead. Hit me with your best. This is the German title. Okay. D

57
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,330
no.

58
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,610
I have taken six semesters of a chairman.

59
00:07:55,484 --> 00:08:17,557
That one is a little bit above me. I can I can run it through Google translate. I usually have. I double check myself on the Spanish anyway. Oh, yeah. I actually knew what y meant from our recent one, the trail of the unicorn, because I looked it up before, and and that means the hunt oh like yeah your hunter. Right. And that last word is bro. Right? I like

60
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:28,112
little out at that one. Right. I why would you be it's that little it's that Al little pin of daisy. So that's Al that's a pretty weird title. Right? Because that's like not

61
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:35,600
of approach. Yeah. That's not the point of the story at all. Alright. What's our title in Spain. This is called

62
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:37,750
Is see.

63
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:38,669
And

64
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:45,850
like you, I I do speak this language, but I have no idea what Al auto means. I know N

65
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,305
Is in the circus. Oh Al

66
00:08:49,185 --> 00:09:04,475
is uproar. Oh okay. That's a pretty good translation of the word bed I'd say. Yeah. That's what I was thinking Yeah. Let's let's see. We'll go one more. I'll do... This is interesting. France has a couple of different titles, but it looks like the most

67
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:06,591
common one is

68
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:08,427
chat var

69
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:10,024
on deli.

70
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:28,265
So Google Translate is failing me. I'm gonna guess that it's circus in Deli. Because it's just saying Sorry var again? Yeah. It's like a a a per raid. So I think it's probably a slang term for circus. So anyway, notable appearances in this one, I would say are only real notable appearance.

71
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:36,434
I mean, I guess we've got daisy in this one, I don't get to do many of these stories that have Daisy. But our quick change artist

72
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:44,195
Zip. Yeah. So he's he's pretty notable. He's definitely a character. Yeah. I definitely will have some thoughts on him, but... Yeah.

73
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:59,582
So, Dan, I usually have a lot of kind of historical or geographical context to talk about in the background for these stories. But I mean, apart from just being fascinated by how the circus was this huge American institution and then basically

74
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,913
side, this really noble death.

75
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:36,961
I don't I don't really have too much to say about this background wise. So let's just launch into the story self. Alright? Yeah good. Awesome. So, you know, here and there, this this one is is a lot more slaps stick. It's kinda filled with mayhem so I might I might summarize a little more than I usually do. But big top bedroom opens up. I I actually really like this opening. Right? It it feels very quintessential all American. It's got the Ducktales enjoying some fishing and they see the circus train crossing this, like, beautiful tres bridge

76
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:48,770
pulling into town. The Ducktales very excited at the prospect of seeing the circus. And and you know, I think this was one of those, like, very American experiences. When the circus came to town

77
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:49,730
historically,

78
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:52,182
people would get so excited.

79
00:10:52,721 --> 00:11:25,153
Sometimes I know that cities would declare, like a holiday. People would just go home, get ready because it was it was just the the big entertainment. So I know it's like a little bit before our time. It was like, you know, the circus or the county fair came of town. You know, it was important years ago, but I think it was more so a little before our time. That was just, you know, it come in big deal, everyone will go type things. Yeah. It was it was a community isn't event. So so the docs drop what they're doing, you know, and they get ready to head to the circus

80
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:39,270
until Donald realizes that he's broke. But Okay. But he he's gonna... He's got the idea that he's gonna raid a secret money cash. Of his. And so on that next page, you know, they they get home and he

81
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:46,715
he's kinda revealing his money cash here. And and this is another of those tropes. Right? He's hidden it and a Star can't sa

82
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:56,350
ten, and I've seen these in old cartoons, but, like, never in real life. And there's a little reference to, you know, there was a previous scare with burglar.

83
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:15,037
So that's why he was hiding it. No one would look in there and it's pretty stinky. And unfortunately, Donald realizes when he looks in that he'd already raided his money cash to pay the rent. A good reason. Okay. And they note that the only thing in there is an old heir bro

84
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:17,231
of of da.

85
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:21,440
And they're all kind of staring at it. They're they're all tempted

86
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:29,876
because it seems valuable. And Donald is is pondering. Dan, do you mind reading what he says on the very last panel?

87
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:35,635
He's talking about the bro, and he says I could it for a saw book. But...

88
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:58,220
Yeah. So... Right. And and that's that's a fun sentence to me. Right? Because, like, hawk is is a very specific thing you do when you pawn something. Do you know what do you know what the sa is dan? I do. A ten dollar bill. Yeah. I I I just I like that. It feels very dated in a kind of a charming way. But I'll tell you before we proceed, this setup

89
00:12:58,597 --> 00:13:17,710
stresses me out. I hate this trope. When anyone does it, when when someone is going to pawn, something that belongs to someone else, I hate it. Yeah. Because you know where the story is going. Yeah. Alright. So on the third page, you know, Donald does kind of rationalizing,

90
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:34,396
you know, the the timing and and how, okay. He could do it. Huey, can he can hack it and he can have it back in time. And and so he decides to do it. Right? Because this is important. It's the circus. It's in town. And Donald is heading towards the pawn shop. We assume

91
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:36,449
he's kind of

92
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:44,094
rep by the bro because it's it smells like sardines. So he's tossing it around a little bit to air it out. And

93
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:48,288
he we get one of those, like, pod piper moments. Right? He doesn't

94
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:53,451
realize that he is starting to attract all of the Al cats in the Vicinity.

95
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:54,328
And.

96
00:13:54,665 --> 00:14:14,555
And one of them snatch it in mid air and runs off with it. And, you know, here we got. Good to cat. Yeah. Yeah. Why I wouldn't it. So this is a fun little page again. Kind of a stressful setup. In short order on the fourth page, Donald is chasing the cat through the city

97
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:18,062
he grabs it by the tail on a bridge

98
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:27,445
and the bro is lost into the river. And well i I I found interesting that the cat. Just the noise it makes the e.

99
00:14:27,822 --> 00:14:32,624
Yeah. Just that sound effect. I was trying to imagine how that would sound from a cat. Right. Well,

100
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:39,116
anytime you're walking through the house in the dark and you step on its tail, I imagine that's it.

101
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:43,438
So on the End of this page, we get this, like, immediate

102
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:48,360
fulfillment of the trope. You know? It's not... This is total happens stance. Right? Daisy,

103
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:53,949
enters the scene at at the worst possible time. Donald is horrified

104
00:14:54,528 --> 00:15:00,876
to see her. So he's just accelerating this. You know, I'm I'm snapping my fingers probably obnoxious into the

105
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:13,167
microphone. But this is just advancing the story really quick wait. Do you mind telling us what Daisy wants from Donald here? Well, she begin saying she was on the way to your house.

106
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,360
Al sure enough. She wants her bro.

107
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:26,125
Exactly. She she wants the bro. It's incredibly convenient, and Donald makes a snap decision here. He is going to tell lie

108
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:45,245
about a large a great big man who knocked him down and took off with it. Again, this is that kind of trope that I find very stressful, very uncomfortable. I I hate the character gets caught you know why and has to cover it. I know. So Daisy

109
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:47,638
responds very predictably.

110
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:56,201
Right? She she wants to call the police as as you might suspect, and she makes the

111
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:21,830
she infer that people from the circus came into town. Right? They're they're well known. I'm I'm sure it's a reputation like like, carney or people who work at the fair, you know, they're fly by night. So she suspects that someone from the circus must have done it and she haul donald off to to go call the cops and and get it. Yeah. I mean, she just has such an in sense about her and you can't help, but

112
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:32,754
you know, just know. She's she just... She's so well meaning. And he just feel bad that she can't find her approach you know, she has no e inkling that her boy

113
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:45,830
possibly did something with it. Yeah. You're you're right. She looks very innocent. She's very bright eyed. When she when she comes on see. What do you... I just noticed, what do you think of her hop? That is very noticeable. It looks like

114
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:52,472
a pile of fruit makes to the flower. Right. I don't know if it's supposed to be like a Carmen miranda thing.

115
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:57,497
I will say Barks doesn't doesn't do a ton of women characters.

116
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:05,741
Sometimes, daisy is not depicted I would say with the most I don't know that he always knows what to do with her, but

117
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:08,195
Al looks like she's got some, like

118
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:10,675
fashion here or something. So

119
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:12,935
she drags him to the circus.

120
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:22,621
Or rather, she's dragging him towards the the police. And he says that, you know, he thinks he can get it back and and he basically ends up talking

121
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:31,335
himself into a corner. Right? Where she... Where she gives in the ultimatum. Alright. We're right here by the circus. You go and get that. Where you recover my bro,

122
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:41,190
don't come back without it or I will call the police. And so he's just kinda standing around feeling sorry for himself at the periphery of the surface.

123
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:59,194
And he chances. He's he's kind of thinking to himself that there's no chance in a million that he's ever gonna see that pen. And right as he's thinking that he smells sardines, and he sees a guy tossing Daisy pin up and down. What else about interesting

124
00:17:59,773 --> 00:18:19,884
funny when he, you know, welcomes the lion and to I eat for lunch. That's how that's how much You gonna bind. He thinks he feels said. Yeah. Yeah he's, like sitting right in front of the lions cage. And and Dan, I I already kind of alluded that this is not my favorite of his stories. I really do enjoy a lot of this background arc. Al lot of the, like,

125
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,182
illustrations

126
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:24,870
showing the surface itself... Did too. So

127
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:33,125
Donald takes off on the next page after this random guy. And he kind of start him. He alarms him a little bit because the guy

128
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:37,634
slips under the the big top tent and

129
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:44,037
Donald follows him and Donald can't tell. The the first person that Donald encounters

130
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:46,274
he's dressed pretty stereotypical,

131
00:18:46,613 --> 00:18:51,443
he's got what seems to be a turban he's speaks with, like, a pretty unfortunate

132
00:18:52,061 --> 00:19:08,502
sort of pigeon dialect. And we can tell that it's the guy that it's the guy that he was following. Yeah. That Donald doesn't know Right. So we get that guy's perspective for just a moment, and he says that how that duck sure wants to see me about some So we we can tell right away that this guy

133
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:18,180
seems to be part of the circus. Quick change seems to be what he's good at. And he doesn't wanna be caught. Yeah. Is a quick change artist.

134
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:27,087
Right. And on the next page, we see him enter a tent that gives his little, like, mini bio and it labels him. Tell tell dan what

135
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:34,633
how he's how he's labeled Zip world fastest quit change artists and it says keep out. Right. So he's

136
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:39,272
he's probably the star of the circus. Right? Donald is

137
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:55,650
tearing all about the circus looking for this guy and causing a bit of a commotion and he essentially gets kicked around into realizing that if he wants to be able to look for this guy without getting bothered, he's gonna need to get a job.

138
00:19:56,265 --> 00:20:02,685
Lot of really interesting panels on this one. You know, we we've got Donald walking past Al lovingly drawn elephant

139
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,580
And then in the very next panel, there's really a a pretty awful

140
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,100
representation of

141
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,634
of a black person

142
00:20:11,012 --> 00:20:19,990
with the the capture of big lips. I I think that the the reprint of this dam that I read that was published and I'm gonna say eighty

143
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:32,910
seven or so. I'm pretty sure that it had censored. You had, like, tried to clean up that image. Is the one I'm shack sharing with you is the original the scan scan of the original from nineteen fifty. Yeah. It's

144
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:37,192
not the most flattering image. But no. It's it's it's pretty bad.

145
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:47,658
Fortunately, it's it's it's pretty brief and it's not that importance to the story. But the ring master says that he can be bull cooked to the elephants.

146
00:20:48,277 --> 00:20:49,510
I don't know that means

147
00:20:51,442 --> 00:21:03,318
But we see a suspicious looking man next to the Ring master, telling him that, you know, little guys got some talent, and you should let me use him in the clown act and

148
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:07,818
we do see that that's zip and casually toss and that bro up and down.

149
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:17,464
And on the next page, we transitioned back to the nephews stand. Do you want tell us a little bit about what the nephews user are up to? They are

150
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:23,697
upset because they want to go to the circus themselves and they think Donald just leaving them

151
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:27,666
leaving them Right. You were telling me before we started a recording

152
00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:32,515
that you were kinda surprised with the nephews in this one. Yeah.

153
00:21:33,135 --> 00:21:34,755
I don't think I've seen

154
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:38,275
this sort of hostility they show towards Donald

155
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:42,970
and other stories as say as i show and this one is...

156
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,050
Yeah. You're right. They're they're pretty

157
00:21:45,390 --> 00:22:03,359
sour towards him. They're they're don't usually see them with that kind angry expression that they'll have through a lot of this one. And they're mischievous a lot especially in the older stories, but they're like, they're almost mcdonald's foil. In this one. Yeah. I mean, Zip is just real foil, but they're like this

158
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,197
extra,

159
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:05,793
you know, source of

160
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:26,553
And what Barks does in these stories is he really does adjust the characters as he needs to. And he just wants to tell the story this time. Right? So he just needed them to have this dynamic I suspect. I think that's part of why this story doesn't work for me that. Well, I don't I don't really like to see them as hostile as they... Yeah. I to seeing them.

161
00:22:27,452 --> 00:22:39,381
And anyways, the be the adult to him and come through come through for him when he's in a bias Right. Yeah. That's a good point because they're usually very resourceful and they do sometimes save the day like the adults.

162
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:45,502
So they they decide to dip into their own stage. So they had to the circus

163
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:46,821
themselves and

164
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,058
we transition to Showtime

165
00:22:49,397 --> 00:22:51,536
really beautiful drawing of

166
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,387
of an elephant and a dancing girl and some other performers

167
00:22:56,245 --> 00:23:00,621
coming out and sort of old circus ga. Yeah. The elephant has a very

168
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:09,740
natural hooked to it, especially in its eyes where it's it's got that wild look. It's not a goofy elephant or anything like that. Yeah. You're right. It's it's very realistic.

169
00:23:10,518 --> 00:23:15,489
You know, we we get the Nephew point of view at this point after the Rem master introduces

170
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:21,735
the circus. And they're just enjoying this spectacle and its some point, they see Donald

171
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:24,295
walking out dressed as clown.

172
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,775
And they're instantly

173
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:28,508
in infuriated

174
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:36,575
because they they have put two and two together and they're assuming that he, you know, forgot about them to get

175
00:23:37,195 --> 00:23:39,415
himself this plush job in the circus,

176
00:23:39,755 --> 00:23:43,375
and they're man sing holding up a sling.

177
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:53,575
Basically, this is setting us up for most of the rest of this story where Donald is going to be looking for the bro and the guy who has the bro

178
00:23:54,033 --> 00:24:15,955
and nephews are gonna be looking for an opportunity to basically mess him up. Anytime Al slingshot comes out, you know, mischief is kinda follow. Right. And and that's another big marker of this era. Right? Because in the nineteen fifties, this was a totally normal thing for a kid to have and we really don't see them these days. And so on the next page, you know, we

179
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:17,695
realized that the...

180
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:20,962
Person doing the introduction has actually

181
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:22,598
been zip

182
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:30,565
himself and he changes he changes from his ring master guys into something that looks like I guess Napoleon bonaparte

183
00:24:31,065 --> 00:24:32,285
and he immediately

184
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:36,492
proceeds to basically give Donald the works.

185
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,365
He fling him onto a little bicycle

186
00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:41,095
and he launches him

187
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:47,495
onto the high wire, and we're gonna get all of this kind of like circus

188
00:24:48,315 --> 00:24:57,550
slaps stick. And I'm trying to decide, like, none of it is very narrative at this point. Right, Dan? No. No. There isn't much narration. It's just

189
00:24:58,345 --> 00:24:59,885
it came pretty abruptly.

190
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:02,605
You know, It just started throwing him on

191
00:25:03,225 --> 00:25:27,404
Circus acts, basically, but there's there's no, like, now I'm going to put him on this. Now I'm going to... Right. So like, the this one is is an unusual story. It actually kinda reminds me way back at the very beginning of of doing the podcast I talked about Donald Duck finds pirate gold, which is a story that he did. I it was originally supposed to be a Donald Duck cartoon.

192
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:35,161
And this kinda of reminds me of of that. Right? Is it's almost like a cartoon story board here, because

193
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:43,527
it's it's just a lot of slaps stick We have Donald being put into some sort of circus peril. We've got zip

194
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:46,263
changing into some new disguise.

195
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:52,799
On the next page, you know, Donald is kind of biking really high on the on the high wire,

196
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:53,675
zip

197
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,080
transforms into a gorilla ton falls.

198
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:07,528
There's some cool perspectives on this page, I guess. Yeah. The... The the change the gorilla is pretty impressive itself... Yeah. And what we're gonna see is donald

199
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:10,003
catching side of the bro.

200
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:11,559
Zip wondering

201
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:19,516
how Donald keeps knowing that it's him and why he's coming after him. And then Nephew being sour about the crowd

202
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:21,650
being impressed with Donald.

203
00:26:22,502 --> 00:26:40,082
And looking for the opportunity to to pay him. So... Yeah. Then you can mention that he reads he stinks. Right. Yeah. And and so we kinda keep transitioning this way. Zip changes into a firefighter fighter, he kind of terror Donald with some

204
00:26:40,394 --> 00:26:41,253
clown mischief

205
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:48,031
on the next page, Donald is like retaining water in his clown suit and zip

206
00:26:48,966 --> 00:27:03,615
changes tell me about his that that quick change is is pretty surprising. I think. Oh, yeah. The devil that was that was it's almost creepy, you know Like just surprising, you know. Right. Because he's, like a a devil with underwear or nothing, but.

207
00:27:05,488 --> 00:27:11,246
It's it's pretty weird. It's it's it's some neat nimble drawing. Any poke semi

208
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:20,907
with his pitch for it because trident whatever and he he leaders he jira that he's leaking like, a water wagon which I think is another

209
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,319
dated reference.

210
00:27:22,898 --> 00:27:25,156
And i was clearly just humiliated.

211
00:27:25,615 --> 00:28:06,130
Right. On the next page, we get another quick change where he's dressed like a skeleton, which makes Donald think that he's pulled everything off except his bones. And one of the clowns has him run through a little paper target right into right onto a donkey keys back. And and then onto to the next page, Donald is always a step behind Zip right who zip directs him to put his head into, like, a little portal where he gets... He gets the classic custard pie. Thrown at him by a clown, custard or lemon? Yes. Yes. And we get one custard and one lemon. And then that user just... They're not enjoying this show at all. Right?

212
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:17,370
No. They think he's having a good time, but... Right. And one of the Nephews is still biting his time waiting for an opportunity to to peg him with another sling.

213
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:21,810
And all this like Mayhem and Slaps kind of escalate

214
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:25,265
that we haven't really alluded yet that

215
00:28:25,765 --> 00:28:26,665
Zip thinks

216
00:28:27,245 --> 00:28:28,685
Donald a bill collect. Yes.

217
00:28:51,022 --> 00:29:00,750
That's a good point. Right? The reason that Zip is trying to avoid him is because he surmise that he's a debt collector, and he says that

218
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:03,067
he's never paid a debt before.

219
00:29:03,805 --> 00:29:06,622
So all of this slaps to kind of

220
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:07,701
escalate

221
00:29:08,175 --> 00:29:13,435
into this big gag he zip lures donald into

222
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:16,208
really

223
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:24,113
impressive looking cannon that is is clearly the classic surface trick, the human cannonball ball. Yeah. And

224
00:29:24,491 --> 00:29:27,901
this this is gonna be an opportunity for the Nephews.

225
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:31,547
Right? Because Zip wants to launch him for the crowds benefit,

226
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:32,340
but

227
00:29:32,998 --> 00:29:34,774
whichever angry nephew

228
00:29:35,152 --> 00:29:36,210
has the slingshot,

229
00:29:36,827 --> 00:29:39,535
to tell what what ends up happening

230
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:44,764
it seems Zip is going to give him like a regular launch, but somehow

231
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:51,770
correct one of the nephews is able to time it So he peg Zip in the rear, makes zip

232
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,530
sort of sq and

233
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:58,745
launch him full blast It's exactly right. He gives him a really mighty launch

234
00:29:59,325 --> 00:30:02,385
onto the next page. You know, he ends up landing

235
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:15,695
outside of the circus tent. And this is Donald head enough. He's gonna quit the circus even if it means not getting that pin back And he's kind of mu over his bad luck, you know, walking around all objectively.

236
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:17,315
And he happens

237
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,475
on the little poster

238
00:30:20,228 --> 00:30:21,287
advertising zip,

239
00:30:21,825 --> 00:30:37,700
and he puts he finally puts two two together. Do you mind reading that last pack panel for us. I get it I catch on quick. That's the guy that has that has the pin zip. It was all those guys, so he knew he's the same person and.

240
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:53,205
So I I I like that a lot Right? Where he says he catches on quick. Yeah. And clearly, you know, I don't know how many is mayhem we just went through, but it was definitely the bulk of the story there. Yeah. So Donald decides to lie and wait.

241
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,000
You know, till the end of the show, he's gonna hide on the next page in Zip

242
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,412
chest. And we transition back nephews who are like too demo

243
00:31:04,111 --> 00:31:07,168
to watch the rest of the show. So they leave bit early.

244
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:09,526
And we get to see Zip

245
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,820
in the end of his act.

246
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,700
And

247
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,227
it's it's a pretty cool finale dan. You wanna tell us about it Yeah. Yeah. He he just zips in and out.

248
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:35,931
Really quick. I mean, he's a fast quick change artist, so he's able to go from Native American to well, it looks like could be like a Spanish bowl. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right. Then finally, to what appears be like, a beautiful woman. And

249
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:43,630
think that native Americans meant to look like the old Cigar store Indians. Have you ever seen those? Yeah. Yeah. I have

250
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:49,776
So the the crowd is... This this is a fitting grand finale. Everyone's very excited.

251
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:53,502
And it's very key that he's finished by transforming

252
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,927
to a woman there. Right? Because when we transitioned back to Donald waiting in ambush

253
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:01,818
what happens?

254
00:32:02,357 --> 00:32:04,455
Well, he he jumps at him and

255
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:07,611
immediately regrets it because he thinks he's

256
00:32:08,564 --> 00:32:11,461
rushing a woman. Right. Right. And and

257
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,898
Zip disguised as the woman

258
00:32:14,757 --> 00:32:29,895
says you thought what? Get out you mash... I I like that. That's such an outdated term. Yeah. I I don't... I mean, I have an idea what they mean by that, but I don't know the even that term in that sense. It's a very gentle way of

259
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:38,783
describing a man who tries sick advantage of a woman I think. I see. Oh, that's funny because that zip goes that far with it. Right. And

260
00:32:39,282 --> 00:32:41,021
so Donald Donald gets

261
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:51,990
hung up as he tries to frantically get him out of this himself out of this pretty awkward situation. He gets caught up on Pin and he says what Pin

262
00:32:52,290 --> 00:33:00,200
Donald says. And on on the next page, zip was telling him about this pin that fell on him

263
00:33:00,698 --> 00:33:18,249
while he was swimming under the bridge, that very morning. And so Donald has figured out you know, we we kinda transitioned so them having kind of a nice moment. Dan you mind telling us about their little moment together? Yeah. I mean, they're the laughing of the story.

264
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:19,207
These

265
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:32,163
you know, Zip says, oh, I I thought you were a bill collector and it's... Oh, I thought you're you were one of the people who are after me over some of the like un moral things I did, but you're not. So that's great or so right. Right. Yeah.

266
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:40,793
They're very buddy buddy very quickly, considering all the mayhem that they just went through. Mh. And so Donald

267
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:46,240
heads off thinking of, you know, thinking of ward off Daisy anger,

268
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:50,255
So as he crosses the bridge on the way back, the the boys,

269
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,695
spy him. They're back to their fishing.

270
00:33:53,095 --> 00:33:54,195
One of the Nephews

271
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:58,962
is is the only one who didn't get a chance with the slingshot.

272
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:05,203
And and we're gonna see it go right back into the into the drink. Al as the Nephew

273
00:34:05,702 --> 00:34:13,366
hits him swear on, he loses the bro and back into the river and he's extremely d.

274
00:34:13,744 --> 00:34:23,018
So he decides that his only option is to go and until Daisy the truth. So This is kinda of one of those things where you're like.

275
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:35,560
You could've have done it that at the very beginning, but obviously, we wouldn't have had our slaps stage story. Well, at least he learned his lesson sure. So he goes back hat in hands ready to confess to Daisy.

276
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:37,293
And he

277
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,888
explains the story

278
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:45,427
and and the narration box makes sure to Al us that he he tells her everything.

279
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:54,053
You know, that his his original plan to hoc the Pin. The his his encounter with Zip. And Daisy

280
00:34:54,884 --> 00:35:00,451
reacts. Could could you tell us stan about her reaction? Yeah. But she gets hysterical and

281
00:35:00,988 --> 00:35:02,140
says that she wanted to go

282
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,980
Club banquet.

283
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:17,219
I guess she wanted the the bro. Was it to be Al classy at the museum? Or was was right Yeah. I think it was meant to be her, like, for Al little show piece. Right? Because it's a family heir.

284
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:21,087
And Donald has this moment of wait. We

285
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:27,213
because she allude to you were gonna take me to the banquet

286
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:28,331
and

287
00:35:28,845 --> 00:35:32,745
We got we got this over the top like, sort of domestic

288
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:33,665
strife

289
00:35:34,445 --> 00:35:40,076
internal monologue where Ton is saying, oh, could anything have been more awful?

290
00:35:42,212 --> 00:35:46,283
He says any punishment will be easy to take now. This is

291
00:35:46,782 --> 00:35:48,100
his internal monologue.

292
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:52,216
He what does he offer daisy, see, Dan?

293
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:56,361
Just says can you take the rolling pin and

294
00:35:57,297 --> 00:36:02,542
massage my scalp, I think he says. Yeah. It's a good... It's a good line. Giving me a good old

295
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,352
goal massage

296
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:10,493
yeah. I'm implying, you know, go ahead beat me with this rolling pin. It's obviously,

297
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:23,873
like, over the top for a comic effect. It's still it's very uncomfortable and hindsight. Right? Yeah. Like, it's these old comics from this era. There was a lot of, like humor in...

298
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:30,897
I don't wanna call it domestic violence exactly because it's coming from such a slaps stick point of view

299
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:33,823
on the face of it, though, it is

300
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:40,443
domestic violence. That's definitely partner abuse. There's also a lot of joking about corporal punishments.

301
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,852
In in these stories, you know, kids getting

302
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:58,073
span and more like hit with switches. So this is just don't I don't know about you. That this is not the kind of thing that I really find as funny these days, but it was it was a totally mainstream

303
00:36:58,451 --> 00:37:03,148
trope. Yeah. I view it more Al a trope. I mean, I didn't find it particularly funny, but

304
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:05,671
you you can see that he's just

305
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:13,143
happy to not be going and that's not have to go there. That the the beating is zone take is is

306
00:37:13,602 --> 00:37:14,102
preferable.

307
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:14,561
Right.

308
00:37:15,294 --> 00:37:20,184
And it is pretty funny to me. Daisy reaction. Right? How she's basically...

309
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:23,156
Because he told the truth finally,

310
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:25,843
She thinks that he's suffered enough.

311
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:27,380
Not only

312
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:32,485
is she not going to continue to be mad Al him. But

313
00:37:32,982 --> 00:37:37,411
she actually wants to cook him up a a really nice dinner.

314
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:43,534
Tell tell us about what she offers to make him. She offers young quail on dumplings.

315
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:47,043
Right. Give blood of young and dumplings.

316
00:37:48,218 --> 00:37:49,875
And and so he's just ex.

317
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:50,765
He is

318
00:37:51,464 --> 00:37:51,964
so

319
00:37:52,302 --> 00:37:59,467
happy about out. This this turned out best paced scenario for him when all is said and done. And

320
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:01,557
Unfortunately, the doorbell...

321
00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:03,432
The buzzer sounds

322
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:04,349
and

323
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:06,921
is is gonna rain on his parade.

324
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:08,235
Because

325
00:38:08,694 --> 00:38:12,249
on the next page as Daisy goes to see who it is,

326
00:38:12,968 --> 00:38:13,468
Donald

327
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:18,721
start a little bit to hear her greeting Hue Louie and Dewey. And

328
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:20,261
and tell us,

329
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:25,894
tell us what he doing in Louis. Present to today's. Well, they...

330
00:38:26,593 --> 00:38:29,050
What they found inside of fish they caught was

331
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:34,201
the very same pendant that Donald for the second time dropped into the river.

332
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:38,701
Right. So we have just all these crazy one and a million

333
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:39,640
coincidence.

334
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:52,901
Right? It's all ver one in a million. So... Yeah. I guess the... I guess the story is pretty consistent on that aspect expect. And then we get, you know, Daisy, of course is delighted and and the closing panel

335
00:38:53,241 --> 00:38:53,741
has

336
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:57,833
Donald and Daisy at this museum ban it and

337
00:38:58,249 --> 00:38:59,546
everyone at that museum

338
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,733
is just this sort of, like, high

339
00:39:03,229 --> 00:39:03,729
society

340
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,020
weirdo,

341
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:08,852
essentially. It's it's all these dope looking

342
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:10,409
rich people

343
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:15,776
listening to a professor keep minds telling us what he's what he's

344
00:39:16,076 --> 00:39:16,576
po

345
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:17,656
about dan.

346
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:25,348
He's seen regional artifacts of the early far era contained the most interest. Worn holes, blah blah

347
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:29,203
a white barbie and I like that rub rhubarb. That's very Barks.

348
00:39:29,722 --> 00:39:33,195
And Donald is just doing over this incredibly

349
00:39:33,616 --> 00:39:37,475
ban boring bit of high society torture that he's

350
00:39:37,856 --> 00:39:40,930
to you know, it's it's one boring evening,

351
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:48,102
right? And probably a pretty good free meal, but... But that is that is big top Bed.

352
00:39:48,481 --> 00:39:51,916
So, Dan, what what are your what are your thoughts about this story?

353
00:39:52,970 --> 00:40:01,483
I I think Zip is... you know, he's like at first, you see as an antagonist, but at the same time, not really, he's just a guy that's caught up in his own

354
00:40:02,075 --> 00:40:02,775
his own

355
00:40:03,515 --> 00:40:04,575
game and...

356
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:12,779
But I also thought, like a a quick change artist. Is is that like actually a thing. I think back when you had, like circus,

357
00:40:13,156 --> 00:40:17,682
it probably was more of... I I know. I can't imagine, like, going

358
00:40:18,593 --> 00:40:21,605
to see some live entertainment that involved

359
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:26,448
that unless it was like a concert where someone was also singing or dancing.

360
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:37,830
Yeah. But Yeah. I mean, it's it's good. You know, even there was... I even saw some, like, innocent innocence and Donald in the same way I saw it in Daisy when he keeps falling for the prank.

361
00:40:38,725 --> 00:40:41,177
It just feel like he's a little trusting

362
00:40:41,713 --> 00:40:45,096
even even in his position. So... Yeah. So

363
00:40:45,432 --> 00:41:07,575
I don't know. Like, usually, when I have someone start the podcast, I like to give them a pretty intriguing story. This one, unfortunately, is not not one of my favorites, but it I think it's an interesting one to talk about I'm gonna have to make you read some of the some of my favorites because this one is so slaps stick. And yeah. So odd

364
00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:08,455
that

365
00:41:09,035 --> 00:41:10,755
it really stands apart.

366
00:41:11,395 --> 00:41:15,709
And like i'm I'm sure for that reason that it's some people's favorites,

367
00:41:16,048 --> 00:41:29,575
but I know that I didn't really come back and and read this one very often as kid. I think I probably haven't read this one in a good twenty five or so years. Yeah. Some of the other ones you've shown me are definitely

368
00:41:29,992 --> 00:41:32,087
more adventurous. They go travel

369
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:34,416
you know, to australia or canada

370
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:37,646
or something like that. And this was more of just

371
00:41:38,183 --> 00:41:39,221
a day at the circus.

372
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:51,275
And, I don't I don't have a problem with that. Like, they don't all have to be adventure stories, but, like, it's so not Monday mundane. But it's like it's just very

373
00:41:51,893 --> 00:42:16,074
little. He it it feels more like one of his ten page gag stories. Because a lot of his stories. Most of them are much shorter stories that are meant to be more slaps like this one. So this one kinda feels like a a ten page gag story that's been stretched out and just has this really interesting setting? Yeah. And I I do think that the art is pretty cool on this one,

374
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:16,645
it's

375
00:42:17,463 --> 00:42:30,195
it's got some... It's got some fun stuff. But but again, this one's really not not a favorite of mine. Yeah. Yeah. So just a few more reflections, you know, I think that it was almost

376
00:42:30,973 --> 00:42:40,191
required that at some point he do a circus. Story. Right? Because it was it was like being a kids show at the time you would... You have your Cowboy

377
00:42:40,609 --> 00:42:41,109
episode.

378
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:41,727
Okay.

379
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,997
A kids show today would have like, a time travel episode.

380
00:42:46,736 --> 00:42:47,615
You might have, like,

381
00:42:48,374 --> 00:42:52,325
it's it's just one of those tropes that you had to do. It's like having a haunted house

382
00:42:52,985 --> 00:43:01,616
issue or episode. So as far as that goes, it works okay. Other Disney media, like I I really like the old Dumb cartoon.

383
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:22,726
You know, that's a fun circus set thing. Yeah. Wonder. I I expect that that was probably something that he was thinking about as he did this one. Dan when I reflect on these, I I like to think about how well these stories hold up, you know, if there's stuff that's like dated or archaic? We talked a lot about this, but it it really bears

384
00:43:23,302 --> 00:43:23,802
repeating

385
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,513
that the circus is almost

386
00:43:27,344 --> 00:43:28,603
completely irrelevant

387
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:37,798
today. And and just how incredibly quickly that happened, it still blows my mind, right? That this story seemed like a normal

388
00:43:38,335 --> 00:43:43,903
thing to write about and to draw an issue about and no one thinks about surfaces

389
00:43:44,281 --> 00:43:46,194
anymore. Yeah. I think

390
00:43:46,692 --> 00:43:50,029
I think today's kids would probably find a circus to be very boring

391
00:43:50,368 --> 00:43:53,039
to be honest. I have but rather.

392
00:43:53,656 --> 00:43:57,665
Hit much rather look... Look up some some silly tricks on Youtube

393
00:43:58,201 --> 00:44:00,894
and I can't say I blame them in some ways.

394
00:44:01,965 --> 00:44:05,940
We know there were a few retro things in this some some problematic

395
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:07,458
depictions. But

396
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:08,417
fortunately,

397
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:10,870
the story didn't really

398
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:16,270
ride too too hard on it. And and there there wasn't even a lot of the, like, animal

399
00:44:16,704 --> 00:44:24,999
angle of the... Like, there was an elephant and there was a lion, but most of the circus stuff was even human performers. Yeah. Specifically Donald. Right.

400
00:44:25,757 --> 00:44:34,190
I I like mention if there... If Barks was famous for doing oil paintings and lit wraps that went along with some of the stories. He

401
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,603
to my knowledge, he never did one for this story.

402
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:45,377
And I'm not aware of, like, any Ducktales or other cartoons that tried to adapt this. I didn't ask you

403
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:55,301
to keep a favorite panel in mind, which I usually do. So I don't know if anything comes to mind. So one of the panels that I actually really liked

404
00:44:55,655 --> 00:45:00,383
was kind of a mundane one. It was his like, relieved expression

405
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:09,462
near the end where he's, like, thinking about how we dodged a bullet and saying, could anything have been more awful? I actually i like that one.

406
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:19,849
Yeah. There's also a lot of really high angled shots, you know, him him up at the trap he's during one of those slaps state moments was pretty cool. Also

407
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:25,516
overlooking the the river at the top of the bridge as the bro

408
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:30,397
p in the water for the last time. I also really like the panel that

409
00:45:31,053 --> 00:45:34,143
showed the perspective of the canon for the human

410
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:41,415
and involved that one was really yeah. I mean, I particularly just like some of the scenery in the in the beginning with the bridge, and

411
00:45:41,912 --> 00:45:47,453
they paint really well the opening and it's got the the old fish sticks where it's like

412
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:56,770
edition poles? Yeah. They have no real. It's just a stick with the line on it and a hook. Yeah. I agree. That that's that's a pretty awesome panel.

413
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,050
And it's it's so

414
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,930
quintessential

415
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,250
mid

416
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:06,818
twentieth century there. Right, the circuit train in the background, the fishing and pulls.

417
00:46:07,156 --> 00:46:14,531
Yeah. Like, that's just it's good old wholesome fun. You know, they're they're and around talking, while fishing, you know, there's couple

418
00:46:15,187 --> 00:46:24,496
brothers just at the fishing hole basically. Yeah. That's the name panel. Any other thoughts about this one again. No. Not particularly. I thought I was pretty straightforward. You know,

419
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:27,549
like, I I did happen to like Zip.

420
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,838
The part at the end, there's only three little

421
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:33,175
panels where it shows them, you know,

422
00:46:34,214 --> 00:46:39,085
socializing and having a good time, but it's it was a little heartwarming to see that there was was no

423
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,945
bad feelings between the two of them. Yeah. That's true. Zip wasn't like,

424
00:46:43,825 --> 00:46:50,560
of villain. Right? He was exactly. He he kinda reminds me of, like, low key from the marvel movies, you know,

425
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,720
haven't seen it.

426
00:46:53,374 --> 00:46:55,351
Well, he's got kind of that, like, tricks

427
00:46:55,889 --> 00:46:57,108
energy that

428
00:46:57,446 --> 00:47:16,615
that loki does, I guess. He's he's a bit of a anti hero I'd say. Yeah. Excellent. Why I really appreciate you joining me for one of these. I'll have to forced you to read a couple a couple of the others that I think pulled up better. I don't think this is a bad story per s. It's just it's just such Al like

429
00:47:16,915 --> 00:47:21,495
artifact. Oh, and you know, I almost forgot to mention what the community itself thinks of

430
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:29,608
So Dan, what what I also like to do. There's a really neat resource called Index instead of index, very clever, where

431
00:47:29,945 --> 00:47:30,863
people can vote.

432
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:33,956
And they can rank rate the stories.

433
00:47:34,636 --> 00:47:44,751
And so if you look at the story, the rating for this one. Mh. Response pretty well regarded by the community has a seven point seven out of ten, which is good for

434
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:47,491
one hundred and thirty eight.

435
00:47:47,986 --> 00:47:48,486
Place,

436
00:47:48,826 --> 00:47:50,686
that ranks all the Disney

437
00:47:51,026 --> 00:48:10,366
stories, the disney comic stories that have pretty much ever been published, which is some like forty one thousand some of them. Oh wow. Yeah. The Barks stories they do tend to rate very high and he did he did over five hundred stories. So to be one hundred and thirty eight. You gotta figure at least half of those are non

438
00:48:11,226 --> 00:48:11,466
stories.

439
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:21,113
It's it's well regarded. It's obviously not regarded as one of the all time greats. But but this is from his kind of his golden era. So so and obviously

440
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:25,245
hands up holds up well for for many members of the community.

441
00:48:25,546 --> 00:48:28,666
Yeah. So so, yeah, I I think this one's worthwhile,

442
00:48:29,265 --> 00:48:35,535
especially if you're a Barks man. I don't think I'm likely to revisit any time soon, but but I'm glad I could

443
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:44,090
I could remember it and and enjoy some some pretty great art. Absolutely. The are are it's really good in this one. It it stands out pretty pretty...

444
00:48:44,427 --> 00:48:49,386
I mean, the colors they use are very pastel like So... Yeah. Yeah. You know, Barks

445
00:48:49,905 --> 00:48:55,792
himself wouldn't colored these. He would have drawn them in black and white. So a good color

446
00:48:56,305 --> 00:49:05,356
was really important to, like, bring these out. But again, I really appreciate you coming on. I hope that I can get you back for another of these. Of course.

447
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,847
I appreciate you having me. And I I I'd love to come back, you know,

448
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:15,355
maybe a little less nervous. Like that didn't show it all. Well, I'm I'm glad I could... I'm glad I could voice

449
00:49:16,213 --> 00:49:17,471
another of these stories

450
00:49:17,848 --> 00:49:22,655
on on friends and family. So thanks again. I hope that listeners

451
00:49:22,992 --> 00:49:23,492
will

452
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:25,287
join us next time

453
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:36,227
When we get to talk about one of his all time great Christmas stories, you can't guess. People can reach out Al Barks remark. At gmail dot com or on our Facebook page.

454
00:49:36,746 --> 00:49:42,330
And I would I would tell everyone to go out and enjoy a day at the circus. But

455
00:49:42,945 --> 00:49:43,723
really clear.

456
00:49:44,737 --> 00:49:46,967
I'll you're looking forward. Awesome. Alright.
