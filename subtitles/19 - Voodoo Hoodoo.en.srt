Hello, and welcome to Barks remark. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks, creator of sc Mc and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comics of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological publishing or We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks.

2
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,860
This is this is Mark. Just wanted to cut in before the podcast

3
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:53,980
and

4
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:02,942
people know that we're talking about Voodoo Who do today. Which is a story that has some content based on some deeply racist

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:22,720
tropes and imagery. I wanted to provide this as both a content warning and I also wanted to explicitly repeat something that I don't get to say the episode until near the very end, which is that while I do enjoy many aspects of this story, I consider it largely un redeem from a modern context.

6
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,960
Boo hut is obviously

7
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,840
a very problematic

8
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,015
story, and I'm grateful to Sarah for helping me process it. We

9
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:46,332
really wanna recognize you know, we're we're gonna do our best to talk about this one in a thought full sensitive manner, but, you know, by nature of what happens in this story, it's going to be

10
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,145
difficult not to talk about it in a way that might be upsetting and

11
00:01:52,445 --> 00:02:01,024
we want to convey our intentions and not to use problematic language as much as possible. Sarah, can you

12
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:08,424
chime in? Yeah. Mark and I are are doing our best but we are not black people. We are not

13
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:15,040
experts, and we don't wish to speak for people who are. We are

14
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:25,005
representing the position of people who are doing our best and have a pretty good idea of what is upsetting, but we obviously

15
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:32,790
will get it wrong because we are not perfect. Yes. Thank you very well said. That said, enjoy our conversation.

16
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:39,822
Hello, and welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever a longtime Carl Barks fan. I

17
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,528
enjoy talking about these Golden age Donald duck and now sc comics

18
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:46,446
with

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,480
guest hosts that have never read them and got a returning guest host today. I'll let her introduce herself.

20
00:02:55,133 --> 00:03:06,725
Hi. I'm Sarah Santiago I've been here before, and I'm not generally a fan of comics, but I think I've read more comics for your podcast and I ever have in my entire life combined.

21
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:11,320
Excellent. So we're expanding horizons here on Barks room.

22
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:15,035
And I I've had you come back for several of these.

23
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:26,033
Number one because I I think you've got a great voice for it. Just number two. I think you're really good at helping me process some of these really challenging

24
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:27,947
stories. And

25
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:31,908
we have a doo of a challenging story today.

26
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:43,287
We're gonna be talking about Carl Barks Voodoo Who do. I think we're both gonna have a lot to save because this this one is probably probably his most controversial

27
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:44,364
story

28
00:03:44,742 --> 00:03:45,500
I would say.

29
00:03:46,312 --> 00:03:49,163
And again, I think you're really good at at processing

30
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:52,987
these stories and you don't have some of the baggage of

31
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:57,760
you, I first read this one in nineteen eighty nine

32
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,660
before I had some awareness of some of the the challenges.

33
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,815
Sarah, what are what are kind of some of your initial

34
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:09,135
impressions just before I even get into the

35
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,583
details of the story. I started

36
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,217
in my notes

37
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:15,891
writing a yikes

38
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,286
for each

39
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:18,654
individual yikes

40
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:25,885
and the yikes per page average was getting so high that my hand was getting tired. So

41
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,044
I gave up on that. It's very high average yikes per page in

42
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:32,860
this comic.

43
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:36,131
Yeah. So I I guess a disclaimer

44
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:44,494
right away. Right? We're gonna acknowledge that this story was created in nineteen forty nine.

45
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:50,283
We are talking about it in two thousand twenty one. I'm not saying that we're gonna

46
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:52,853
excuse it for its

47
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,651
very challenging content.

48
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,885
But we're gonna recognize that it it did come out of a different world. It came out of a culture

49
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,180
in which

50
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,180
the racial car

51
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,820
and depictions

52
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,020
were widespread

53
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,220
almost

54
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,120
universal.

55
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:12,055
Across the comics industry at this time.

56
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:14,355
However, there there were definitely

57
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:16,615
creators at the margins.

58
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:22,953
Who are not engaging in these kinds of tropes and and that's important to say too because

59
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:35,246
we should recognize that you know, it's it's not out of our role and that there are people in in those earlier times who did get it. Right? I think we're gonna be very critical of this story

60
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:42,085
I have a little more baggage with it. Right? Because I read it so young before I had real awareness

61
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:53,702
of of some of the the problematic content. So I might be a little bit more defensive of it. That's not to say that I don't see a lot to criticize in it.

62
00:05:54,478 --> 00:06:00,055
So Sarah, I sent you scans from the the recent fan graf

63
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:06,270
reprint. I thought it was important to do that because that one presented it as it was originally

64
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:13,720
published. Right? And Carl Barks wouldn't have had anything to do with the coloring decisions that were made in that one. But

65
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,680
subsequent

66
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,520
reprint of Voodoo hut

67
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:18,571
will have included

68
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:20,886
significant sensory.

69
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:28,210
Right? So the version that I read in nineteen eighty nine, which was published by Gladstone,

70
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,169
made some edits

71
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,930
to kind of remove some of the racial car

72
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:41,770
of some of the African characters. That would have downplayed at least like, the oversized lips. Kind of the racial

73
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:43,047
dialect.

74
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,699
However, it made a couple of edits

75
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:54,472
that Barks wished he could have done. Right? Weirdly, his publishers asked him not to refer to characters as being

76
00:06:54,891 --> 00:07:10,425
dead. So in in the version Sarah that you read they are referred to as done for Right? Anytime you see done for, he he originally wrote it as dead. I I guess it's a good time also to talk about one other change that was voiced upon Barks.

77
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:15,845
He originally drew bomb the zombie having kind of vacant classy eyes,

78
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:17,125
but his editors

79
00:07:17,718 --> 00:07:25,650
objected to this, and they asked him to give him or they put in some some pupils for this one to make him look a little bit less.

80
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:26,764
Men.

81
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:30,074
Maybe it's because I read it that way originally, but I actually...

82
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,577
I think I prefer that because I think it it me the zombie, like, more of a lovable

83
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:36,749
sleepy

84
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:40,784
look to him? Yeah. He does have pretty droop eyelids.

85
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:50,456
Yeah. He looks just kinda sleepy and tired. Right. And and then one of the really notable things about this story is that this is the first

86
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:51,852
instance where

87
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:53,846
Marx is gonna show

88
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:57,904
an a character that's coded as African America.

89
00:07:58,501 --> 00:07:58,740
Right?

90
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:07,638
Bop on the very first page I had no idea in my printing because again, they kind of took out his dialect

91
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:18,183
and they colored him coded as quote white. And and so, you know, in in that one, he kinda just comes across as, like, a a a juvenile

92
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,590
eccentric person,

93
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:29,183
whereas I think the intent in Barks original one is to just show kind of a, quote, average African American,

94
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:31,378
like a a jazz musician,

95
00:08:31,756 --> 00:08:34,270
again, who who is coded is being immature,

96
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:36,978
It's still a very stereotype

97
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:43,370
representation, but I I definitely think that Barks was kind of trying to knock

98
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,841
himself from only having,

99
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:54,314
you know, sinister black characters in that one. I did have a question about popped up because he had the

100
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:55,235
stereotypical

101
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:56,795
min

102
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:59,370
white mouth blackface

103
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,745
appearance. And I wanted to ask about that, you know, how intentional was that

104
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:08,455
was it changed in the revised versions?

105
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:10,449
Yeah. So

106
00:09:10,786 --> 00:09:18,127
let me do our our background details. And then why don't we talk about that. It's just since he comes up right on that first page. Right?

107
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:28,230
Sure. Yeah. Because because Bob up for for his, like, just two frames of appearances is really interest I think he says a lot about Barks

108
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:38,572
intentions with this story. So let's let's go ahead. Boy. I I I have a lot to say about this one. I'm sure you do too. K. Right. So Voodoo Hut

109
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:39,451
was

110
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,619
it's it's cover date is August nineteen forty nine. You know, we're still

111
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:47,255
we're we're roaring to the fifties

112
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:56,340
we're still definitely in that post war era. Very crucially for for this story, we're in a very, like post colonial.

113
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:58,451
Era, right? Because

114
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,405
these are kind of the waning days of colonialism.

115
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:10,524
Not that colonialism and its effects are ever gonna truly wan. But this was published in four color two hundred and thirty eight.

116
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:14,060
It has maybe more reprint than you might guess.

117
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:15,574
There are seven

118
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:19,235
including the original in the United States at least.

119
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:23,629
And this one is a thirty two pager. It's

120
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:27,456
definitely one of his longer ones. I'll just give a Al synopsis

121
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:30,763
as Donald and the boys traveled to Africa,

122
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:35,134
to attempt to lift a voodoo curse. And that's a pretty

123
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:39,915
representation of the story. So we'll get much more into detail.

124
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,106
Alright. So so for a little bit of background Trivia,

125
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:53,068
right away, I would characterize that this one really stands out as being one of Carl Barks most horrific stories. Right?

126
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:59,149
You were here for the old Castle Secret, which, you know, he drew some inspiration from, like the old Ec

127
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,545
horror comics.

128
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:05,131
I would say that this one maybe wears its horror movie

129
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:08,321
Dna even more so than that one. And

130
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:09,694
he was

131
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:11,574
inspired directly

132
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:12,654
by

133
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:13,814
the famous

134
00:11:14,235 --> 00:11:28,379
old class zombie movie, the Be Lug film white zombie, you know, which is where the rock band also took their name from. That one came out way back in nineteen thirty two. And there was this like, really

135
00:11:29,115 --> 00:11:35,095
spooky scene. I had never seen this before and I watched Al clip of this scene last night and it's it's pretty haunting.

136
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:41,209
Where there's like this sugar mill that is being run by by zombies.

137
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,750
Right? The the zombies are providing the labor for it.

138
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:47,378
And every once in a while,

139
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:50,329
one of the zombies will kind of just

140
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:51,246
stumble

141
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:53,399
and fall placid

142
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,129
into the machinery

143
00:11:55,788 --> 00:12:03,260
and just be ground up, you know, they did they don't show you any gore, but they really don't need to, because you know what hap. Just to see that happen,

144
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:05,609
it it was very, very.

145
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:09,996
I recommend any listeners check it out. You can find it pretty easily on Youtube.

146
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:16,237
Obviously, something that's stuck with Carl Barks when he's saw, he was quoted as saying

147
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:22,790
every few seconds, zombie would lose his footing and fall into the grinder where he silently got ground into Hamburger

148
00:12:23,184 --> 00:12:33,239
I became convinced that zombies do not feel and I set out to preach their virtue as ideal stu for anyone who needed a dangerous job done cheaply.

149
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:34,713
And

150
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:38,021
further inspiration

151
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:43,382
came from a painting the Carl Barks saw in a publication called the American weekly.

152
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,380
It's

153
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:48,355
accompanied a story called I met a zombie.

154
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:55,670
And, you know, he kind of toned down the, like, gruesome appearance, but he got some inspiration for Bam.

155
00:12:56,125 --> 00:13:02,265
In that one. Right now might be a good time to kind of talk about the origins of the zombie

156
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:03,440
myth

157
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:05,116
archetype.

158
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,831
Yeah. Entity to,

159
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,184
they're a part of haitian

160
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,411
voodoo culture. Mh. And they are

161
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:16,316
specifically a re animated Barks.

162
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:19,090
And so I thought it was really interesting

163
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,536
that in the in the comic book, they

164
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:27,965
referred to him as done for. Right. Instead of saying that he was a re animated corpse and then they

165
00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:31,810
said that once the we know whatever Zombie potion

166
00:13:32,147 --> 00:13:37,910
wears off that he'll have a nice and full life because that's not how the, you know, original

167
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:38,867
zombie

168
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:49,172
and works. Yeah. I do wanna take a second to point out too that there's a difference between Food religion and Voodoo religion.

169
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:50,970
They're both dia

170
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:53,607
religions that were created

171
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:55,525
that that grew in

172
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,297
slave enslaved people's

173
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:01,169
communities based on west and central African,

174
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:07,211
like religions that were, you know, brought along with the slaves. Right. But they were not

175
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:08,209
necessarily

176
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:09,287
practiced

177
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:10,844
in Africa

178
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:14,890
themselves. Although Voodoo do was based more direct

179
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:16,844
on an African

180
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,107
religion. Who do was purely a North American

181
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:26,609
off screen. So my understanding is that a who do is like a curse.

182
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:28,068
Right, But

183
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:30,840
called who. Yeah. And it's

184
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,280
it's very similar

185
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,820
and it's the way that it's kind of en with

186
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,495
Christianity is quite interesting too the way that I was kind of seeing this was that Voodoo

187
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:44,495
was

188
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,188
wrapped up more with catholicism.

189
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:48,187
And

190
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:49,506
who do

191
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:50,664
tied into

192
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,023
protestantism.

193
00:14:52,642 --> 00:15:02,735
Yes. That's that's interesting. See I knew that Voodoo of course had like this rich history. Right? And and like you say, it's it's kind of centered around haiti.

194
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:08,679
But it does bring in a lot of elements of these like, very old African

195
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:19,188
traditions, but it is mostly through Haiti, which is not mentioned. Here at all. I've seen who to used in comics of this era as kind of a noun.

196
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:22,600
So I I think that it has like a c

197
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,600
definition as curse.

198
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:32,644
No. No. Absolutely right. But it's not necessarily evil in the way white

199
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:35,116
centric American Christians

200
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:39,717
like to take the evil elements of other people's

201
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:40,833
religions

202
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:41,709
and

203
00:15:42,165 --> 00:15:48,663
import them into their stories. Yeah. And and that's a really important point that you're making. Right? Because

204
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:50,101
both of these

205
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,616
belief systems, are things that have been given this really sinister

206
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:58,508
ting. Immediately, you say Voodoo.

207
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:04,940
I don't know about you, but growing up. If I heard the word Voodoo, it just had this very dark mysterious

208
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:05,953
evil

209
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:06,950
connotation,

210
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:13,607
but it's just another belief system that has a very specific set of values

211
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:16,215
that has been coded as evil

212
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:18,450
because of white

213
00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:30,655
fear of black power I would say in black agency I would say that too. I think that as kids who grew up, you know, primarily Christian churches and communities,

214
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:43,969
we are kind of brought up to believe that any kind of witchcraft at all is quote unquote evil. Right. And then as we've grown older and I don't know about you, but I've met so many

215
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:47,937
practitioners of witchcraft of from all over

216
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:50,170
so many varying practices

217
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:51,048
and

218
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,919
all of them have experienced marginal

219
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,525
because of the

220
00:16:57,023 --> 00:17:00,836
witchcraft element, but it's a very specific type of marginal

221
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:06,996
as far as these black practitioners of... Yeah. I think the key is that

222
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:09,069
christianity was really

223
00:17:09,766 --> 00:17:13,913
suspicious of any religion that seemed to like revel and Al

224
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:24,849
kind of elevating the natural world, which of course, Voodoo does. And yeah I... Another element limit too is that who do was created specifically

225
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:25,808
by

226
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:27,806
enslaved African Americans

227
00:17:28,345 --> 00:17:28,845
as

228
00:17:29,184 --> 00:17:29,684
resistance.

229
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:39,655
And and I see you know, one line that would Wikipedia has that just says the word who do means spirit work. So, yeah You're you're absolutely right. Oh, you know it's it's also

230
00:17:40,035 --> 00:18:09,281
just briefly we'll note, of course that like in these days, we hear zombie and we immediately have another idea of like a kind of movie monster zombie. Right? So this doesn't even touch on that element Of zombies and pop culture. That came out of what George romero night of the living dead that was still... That hasn't come out yet. I do think it's neat to see this other take on a zombie. And, you know what Barks is gonna do in this story is he's gonna mine

231
00:18:09,595 --> 00:18:12,015
the kind of idea of a zombie

232
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:30,475
as this... As a boo man it's it's impossible to remove it from some of these like, cultural anchors. But but, you know, I I think he he saw that movie. He thought this this would make a really interesting idea I'm gonna craft this story. And of course, I'm gonna use these tropes that

233
00:18:30,815 --> 00:18:32,875
all of these other comic creators

234
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,890
are doing, and I'm gonna give it this little v of science

235
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:42,700
and make a memorable story out of it. So I also think when we talk about the background to the story,

236
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,093
that it is set in, quote, Africa.

237
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:49,486
Right, Generic Africa. This is something that western

238
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:56,281
almost always do. You know, my reading of the story is that it's meant to be somewhere

239
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:57,198
around

240
00:18:57,695 --> 00:19:06,485
what is today what the democratic Republic of the congo. Part of the setting is Al a rubber plantation, which has its own very dark history,

241
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,818
And and then the word Zombie

242
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:23,535
itself was first recorded in eighteen nineteen in a history of Brazil by the Poet Roberts south in the form of Zombie without an e. And it actually is thought to refer to the Al Brazilian rebel leader named Zombie,

243
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:24,569
but

244
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:28,444
you already mentioned it very well, but in haitian folk a zombie

245
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:33,215
is an animated corpse raised by magical means such as witchcraft.

246
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:38,670
Any... Alright. So I see as far as some other translations around the world

247
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:39,628
that

248
00:19:40,084 --> 00:19:44,767
when it was first published in Brazil, it had the more Ana title, Donald

249
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:45,883
Africa

250
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:47,612
Donald in Africa.

251
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:49,486
That's in Portuguese.

252
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:55,685
I see that its first danish publication used the same title Voodoo Hut.

253
00:19:56,379 --> 00:20:01,488
I see in Finland and finnish in nineteen seventy two is published as Arp,

254
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:05,341
which I think is the word for Donald Duck, y.

255
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:13,377
Right? So it's probably something like Donald duck and the zombie b. But this is interesting in in French in nineteen

256
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:18,153
Its first publication in French was not till nineteen seventy six.

257
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:20,565
And and it was called Don

258
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:24,922
Goof because later on, it was called just

259
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:28,388
bam zombie. Mh. And then

260
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:29,877
So in Italy,

261
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:31,193
we've got Papa

262
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,190
and

263
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:33,625
Fit

264
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,699
and then later on

265
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:37,830
voodoo.

266
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:39,225
So translate

267
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:40,164
says that

268
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:46,085
Is fetish. I wonder if it's like referring to the little doll as as a fetish.

269
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:55,804
Right. And the just sense of it. Because that that can sometimes be called, like, a fetish doll. Right? Right. Yeah. Yeah. Good point. Okay. I'm gonna

270
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:57,504
talk about the story now.

271
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:00,345
So Voodoo who do?

272
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:07,252
Opens up with Donald walking throughout Ducktales and over hearing people talking

273
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,345
about

274
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:12,537
a zombie that's been cited in town. And

275
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:14,413
this this page really

276
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:23,980
sets this up as something that everyone is talking about Donald is just over hearing it at this point. It's it's setting up this very creepy

277
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:24,940
atmosphere.

278
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,115
And eventually, he's gonna talk to bob bob. Who he mentioned.

279
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,835
Donald is gonna kinda ridicule

280
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:35,955
everyone talking about this zombie sighting until he

281
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:38,484
trips over the actual zombie

282
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:41,394
in the very last panel of the page.

283
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:49,514
This page had so much going on. Right? The first panel are some, like, streets sweep.

284
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:54,595
I thought it was funny that one of them was, like, sitting down on the fire hydrant

285
00:21:54,949 --> 00:22:06,134
And then the second panel was really cool. It was just like a guy at a food counter, and Donald was over hearing him. The third panel made me crack up because it was these very

286
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:07,695
fancy wealthy

287
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:09,494
ladies with fir.

288
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:12,914
Yeah. And one of them says to the other a zombie,

289
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:14,868
he should be jailed,

290
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:24,431
and another one says what for He hasn't done anything but walk around sleepy the eyed and the first thought I had was every white woman

291
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,705
who calls the cops on a black person just for

292
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:45,017
Yeah. Oh, absolutely. This first woman is definitely that person. And and then the second woman, you know, she is offering up this mild defense and pointing out, he hasn't committed a crime. He's just exists. First one is not in my backyard,

293
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:46,750
and the second one is

294
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:48,983
maybe not in my backyard.

295
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:55,973
Yeah. Exactly. And I I remember distinctly when I read this one as a kid. I was I was horrified

296
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:56,809
by

297
00:22:57,824 --> 00:23:00,914
society, high society lady number one's, just

298
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:02,725
incredible nose.

299
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:19,336
It it really disturbed me. Well, all of the wrinkles around her mouth, like you can just see what a bitter frown woman she is. Yeah. She she's grow test. And I think Barks literally drew her nose so that she could turn it up at Donald.

300
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:20,415
Zombie.

301
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:21,608
And,

302
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:25,357
you know, the the original printing has them colored

303
00:23:25,934 --> 00:23:26,992
weirdly dark

304
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:41,879
because in reprint, they depict them as the very white women that they are. Mh. And and then we get to bath. Right? We already talked a little bit about pop, but it's Again, I really think that this is Barks

305
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:50,448
his intent here and and this is gonna sound like a defense of him but but his intent here is to show that Donald is actually very comfortable

306
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:58,640
talking with him. And to maybe Peg Don this a little bit of an out cast him south. Right? Because he's talking with a Jazz musician

307
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,000
very comfortably

308
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,240
in in a very familiar manner.

309
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,335
You know, he knows bob bob very well. Obviously.

310
00:24:06,115 --> 00:24:18,030
So there... There's a lot going on in these two panels of Donald just interacting casually with this black jazz musician. Yeah. It's extremely problematic and that he's drawn with that min

311
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,085
white mouth And then his his dialogue, which I'm not even gonna read

312
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,995
I don't feel comfortable enough even reading that. Right. It's very

313
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:29,751
that old time

314
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:39,275
gone with the wind era. Oh like Amos and andy or something. Right? Yeah. And and and so, you know, what do we do? We we tend to

315
00:24:39,653 --> 00:24:50,173
go to our black friends because they're experts on, you know, x y z, which we is generally a micro gretchen because we're generally coming to them for oh

316
00:24:50,551 --> 00:24:59,409
you're a black guy, please. Tell me about this question I have about rap. Right? You know, it's just Right. It's generally, like, horrible things, horrible

317
00:25:00,026 --> 00:25:02,801
examples of micro questions when we go to people

318
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:24,530
who are black and ask them questions about things But I thought it was really interesting. He was like, Huey, hop up. You're an expert on ghost stuff. What is this zombie be? And I thought that was just like a... Oh okay. Like it just happens that pop is an expert on ghost stuff. You're right. Right... It's not the fact he's not approaching him ostensibly because he's black.

319
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:44,372
Because he's just an expert on ghost stuff because their friends, you have an extremely good point. Like, he's just chatting with his friend. These two panels are doing a lot of heavy lifting and and there is. It may be a little tortured, but there is a progressive read on them. You know, it's it's very dated and it's problematic

320
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,048
in and of itself.

321
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:46,925
But,

322
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:51,415
you know, it Barks I I think that what he is intending

323
00:25:51,835 --> 00:25:55,575
here is to say, Donald does not have a problem

324
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:56,635
with Black.

325
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,630
Right? Donald has

326
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:09,824
an issue with the Voodoo curse that he's been placed on that that's been placed on him. I think it's maybe the nineteen forties way of saying, I don't see color.

327
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,830
And that it's

328
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,510
your intentions

329
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:18,470
are so good and and I know what you mean, but your execution

330
00:26:19,105 --> 00:26:19,605
is

331
00:26:20,303 --> 00:26:22,002
very lacking. Mh.

332
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:36,791
And then so bob up is also shown as very juvenile too is my read on Right? Because he's on this little tiny motorbike. And so that that was part of My read was like, oh, you you're very childish. Right? You like ghost stories

333
00:26:37,303 --> 00:26:42,365
and then I know we're spending a lot of time on this page, but, you know, Donald again, he trips over.

334
00:26:43,122 --> 00:26:45,075
We're gonna learn that it's bomb the zombie b.

335
00:26:45,848 --> 00:26:47,745
And and, you know, tell me Sarah

336
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:51,497
a little bit about your impressions just visually, but also

337
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:52,575
stylist

338
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:53,991
of of bam.

339
00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:59,545
So so Bam wearing he's very tall. He has these long

340
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,405
hanging droop arms.

341
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,720
Almost

342
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:08,240
like a great ape and he's he's dark skinned. He has

343
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,820
ring piercing in his nose,

344
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:18,895
his ear lobes are stretched out. His clothes, his white shirt thing is is tat. He has something

345
00:27:19,275 --> 00:27:22,544
white on his head. That actually shows up on

346
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:30,772
some of the characters when they get to Africa, and I'm not sure was that supposed to be an a in the color missed it?

347
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:42,150
I I think it is. I think kind about that. Well, I think it shows, no. I think it's his hair. It's just he's very old. Right? He's been around for a long time. So he's scott white hair at this point.

348
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,890
Okay. Yeah. And he's just got this, like, very

349
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:47,505
dead looking

350
00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:50,745
gaze. Right? And we've got a little background of

351
00:27:51,085 --> 00:27:53,025
someone looking at him in

352
00:27:53,499 --> 00:28:01,240
puzzle or terror. Mh. Out of window. Yeah. Right. So on the next page, Donald, you know, interacts with him,

353
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:02,793
and he

354
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,150
pretty quickly

355
00:28:04,528 --> 00:28:07,281
realizes that this guy doesn't look like he's alive,

356
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,856
and the zombie he

357
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,950
Yeah. He reaches out and he hands

358
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,930
donald a a doll like a fright doll.

359
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,362
Britain has this, like, history of these

360
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:29,159
dolls called... Can I say dolly logs? Is is it... So I it reminds me of what the, like, very popular

361
00:28:29,578 --> 00:28:47,288
in the sort of commonwealth countries would call a gu log, these old dolls. It would look up really quick. Oh, god. Doesn't that look like okay. Yeah. I... You know, I was wondering I looked up voodoo dolls. I looked up the... There's kind of carved wooden dolls that Al Fuji dolls,

362
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:59,076
which as you said earlier are generally not used in the practice of Voodoo. Right. But there there is another kind of doll that is that's based on a,

363
00:28:59,454 --> 00:29:01,150
you know, western central

364
00:29:01,647 --> 00:29:02,147
African

365
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:04,752
So... And I just... I looked all over

366
00:29:05,129 --> 00:29:15,359
like played around and wikipedia couldn't figure out what that was And there you go. Yeah. So I don't I didn't see that reference anywhere, but that's what the doll reminded me of.

367
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:25,963
And these were you know, pretty popular for a long time especially actually in I think the Uk and Australia. And, you know, it's interesting the story never goes into sort of the classic voodoo

368
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:36,740
you know, controlling someone through a doll, even though it has a voodoo doll. So I wonder that must have been a trope that wasn't really in place. Or that's just not what he was interested in. But anyway,

369
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,780
Bam

370
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,706
where the zombie be at this point, he he hands him the doll, and then he just kinda walks away. And,

371
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:59,170
you know, Donald kind of puzzles over this doll and kinda reconcile, Oh well. Just some screw ball. I'm gonna take it home show the kids. I'm me to kick out of it. And then as the zombies walking away, Donald realizes

372
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:04,312
Oh, everybody is afraid of it and running away. I wonder if that's the zombie.

373
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,966
I like that image of the

374
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:13,720
incredibly white looking woman. Right, Blonde haired young white woman, running in terror.

375
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:17,661
We haven't even talked about this as kind of a sub

376
00:30:18,197 --> 00:30:24,377
for what was happening in America at the time. Right? Is is that black people were moving into the suburbs,

377
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:28,413
And and I don't think that I don't think anyone consciously

378
00:30:28,872 --> 00:30:30,390
thinks that they're gonna write a story.

379
00:30:31,085 --> 00:30:37,625
About that. But would you think that this is that there's some sub for this? I don't know since I'm not

380
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:55,945
I don't know a lot about what was going on in the Us at that time. You know, the the Gi bill was Mh was just starting to make this popular for some of this mobility. Or so I think this is some of the the sub here. On the following page, Donald gets home

381
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:10,600
he is he's not scared at all at this point. He looks very placid, and he presents the doll to the nash fuse. And one of them, you know, I'm just gonna quote says it's an ugly thing. Squeeze it. Maybe it goes b or something.

382
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:14,207
Donald gives it a quick squeeze and he immediately

383
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,082
recoil and pain

384
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,632
saying that there was a thorn in it that stuck in his... That stuck is

385
00:31:21,663 --> 00:31:25,670
and he very quickly feels faint and collapses.

386
00:31:26,246 --> 00:31:35,363
And the Nephews freaked out, they say that they need call a doctor because I'm Mcdonald's been poisoned. Right? It's a very c way of saying poisoned.

387
00:31:35,802 --> 00:31:37,600
I am... I like this page,

388
00:31:38,015 --> 00:31:40,795
you know, it's it's some cool storytelling.

389
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:41,595
It...

390
00:31:42,095 --> 00:31:53,830
It's very frightening. I think. You know, it his his faint team spell looked very frightening and very threatening to me. When I read this as a kid, I should I I should note. This scared me a lot.

391
00:31:55,205 --> 00:32:00,025
Alright. Oh, man. This next page again, this does... There's a lot of storytelling

392
00:32:00,525 --> 00:32:04,719
really quickly in this one. You know, we get this news boy doing classic.

393
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,315
X x

394
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:09,167
read all about the guy, what Gottfredson

395
00:32:09,447 --> 00:32:10,785
pa voodoo doll.

396
00:32:11,123 --> 00:32:12,160
That's great dialogue.

397
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:31,550
We've got your society ladies. Do you wanna tell me a little bit about their interaction here? The care in one is the... That's... All you gave in the doll. I knew It was up to no good. And then the other one out of nowhere is just saying they say, Donald Duck is turning to brass. Like...

398
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:38,270
So I'm just so confused about why this information got to the news boy. And then

399
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:39,309
around

400
00:32:39,687 --> 00:32:40,546
everybody in the

401
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:44,276
in then in the next couple of panels,

402
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:51,116
Uncle Sc is reading about it in his in the newspaper while he's sitting at a fast full of his money. Mh.

403
00:32:51,754 --> 00:32:55,865
Yeah. And and then uncle Scrooge, you know, immediately pays on all the visit.

404
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,100
And

405
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,300
takes a look at that doll and references,

406
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,920
boy. That's quite a story.

407
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,034
And he does actually say the words Voodoo Who do. And

408
00:33:06,493 --> 00:33:18,483
and and the thing about turning to brass is weird to me, I think that must have just been a a kind of joke about how Stubborn Donald is. That's how I've always read it, but I admittedly didn't look that up.

409
00:33:18,922 --> 00:33:22,572
You know there's so much going on that I didn't either. And there's

410
00:33:22,924 --> 00:33:25,620
there's so much that I don't understand

411
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:27,576
from this jennifer generation

412
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:32,266
I just was like, that must be something they just said back then.

413
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,340
Yeah.

414
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:40,931
But, you know, then the the first the karen society lady had her own panel just dedicated to her.

415
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:46,385
Saying sniff. He hasn't far to go. He was already solid from the nick.

416
00:33:46,765 --> 00:33:47,165
Yeah. Like,

417
00:33:48,005 --> 00:33:48,905
super able

418
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:51,358
commentary on his intelligence,

419
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:58,685
but she's just drawn so specifically with all of those wrinkles and that nose that's

420
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:01,122
claw downward almost.

421
00:34:01,781 --> 00:34:03,958
Yeah. She's just a very

422
00:34:04,297 --> 00:34:06,210
specific drawing isn't she

423
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:12,090
she is very specific. Yeah. That she kinda lives rent free in my head. She's drawn some.

424
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:20,955
Yeah. That Yeah. It's it's saying a lot how much she stuck with me in this story that has a zombie and a witch doctor and a shrunk man.

425
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:23,108
No

426
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:24,266
spoilers.

427
00:34:25,604 --> 00:34:26,104
Yeah.

428
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:27,063
So

429
00:34:27,602 --> 00:34:29,580
we go on to the next page where

430
00:34:30,054 --> 00:34:31,672
sc starts to reveal

431
00:34:32,052 --> 00:34:32,552
that

432
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:45,661
this was a curse that was intended for him, and it was meant to shrink him about the size of a rat. And, you know, sc is not showing very much empathy here. This is this is the more villainous

433
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:56,315
version of sc that Barks is gonna pretty quickly course correct here. You know, he he hadn't figured out what kind of character he wanted to make him, but this is

434
00:34:56,852 --> 00:34:58,808
just about his most villainous us.

435
00:34:59,846 --> 00:35:02,301
You know, and this is gonna start Donald

436
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:05,429
complete freak out. You know Donald gonna be

437
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:06,865
very

438
00:35:07,442 --> 00:35:09,618
terrified and coward and

439
00:35:10,076 --> 00:35:16,937
preoccupied. For most of the rest of this story. And I didn't really talk about that version of the characters. That's something that's been interesting

440
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:26,218
me. You know, Donald role here is now to be scared and desperate for the rest of the story. And Sc is is one of the antagonists.

441
00:35:26,797 --> 00:35:35,488
But he's never like, quite represented has a a pure of villain in this one, even though the the kind of references that he makes to his history,

442
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:39,649
you know, paint him in a very villainous light.

443
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:49,356
And because he says some old enemies of mine wanted to give me the works, but Donald here gets the work in dead and he laughs at that.

444
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:54,721
And, you know, Donald kinda fights him and and he starts to tell more about the story.

445
00:35:55,294 --> 00:35:57,389
Yeah. It wasn't sure how

446
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:00,597
whether this was just like normal slaps stick. Like.

447
00:36:01,354 --> 00:36:05,140
I'm on Scrooge and I think poorly of everybody or

448
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,900
if he was

449
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:15,872
really just a bad guy because he doesn't just make fun of Donald and say, you're getting this punishment that was meant for me

450
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:20,920
and and here's what it is, but then he just goes on to talk about how he

451
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,359
this... On this next page, it's just

452
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,760
another one of those where the yikes per page count is

453
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:29,940
extremely high.

454
00:36:30,594 --> 00:36:32,013
And he describes...

455
00:36:32,472 --> 00:36:38,046
He describes these this rubber plantation that he wanted to buy in Africa and

456
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:42,575
he he refers to the the people who lived there as

457
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:45,212
as ferocious savages,

458
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:49,101
their voodoo do dogs, priced the ground

459
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,020
and

460
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:56,486
okay. They wouldn't sell, so I hired a mob of thugs and chased the drive into the jungle

461
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:04,420
Like, he's so proud of himself for these horrible acts. But how I was I don't know if if

462
00:37:04,894 --> 00:37:08,635
those acts and that language would have been seen as

463
00:37:09,174 --> 00:37:10,714
as bad as they were

464
00:37:11,214 --> 00:37:13,135
back in nineteen forty nine. Right.

465
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:18,634
Exactly. Right? Because we're at the tail end of colonialism

466
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:22,474
where basically countries were doing exactly what

467
00:37:23,015 --> 00:37:26,075
sc said here. And and I think it was probably

468
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:28,234
perceived at more as ras

469
00:37:29,015 --> 00:37:31,354
than villainous. Right? Because

470
00:37:32,465 --> 00:37:39,302
because of the legacy of this. But this is a real problem for for fans of Scrooge doc. Right? Because this is

471
00:37:39,813 --> 00:37:41,866
really terrible depiction of him.

472
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:43,159
This is like,

473
00:37:44,115 --> 00:37:45,252
Robert Barks,

474
00:37:45,509 --> 00:37:52,146
you know, it does not square with how he describes himself later in his most iconic story.

475
00:37:52,943 --> 00:38:00,888
Only a poor old man that I made it. I made my fortune by being smarter than the smart and tougher than the tough

476
00:38:01,227 --> 00:38:02,865
and I made it square.

477
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:11,915
Right? And and that's really key to the sc mythos and what people love about sc Mc. You know, that he's this scrappy self made

478
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:12,875
quad,

479
00:38:13,815 --> 00:38:14,315
who

480
00:38:14,655 --> 00:38:16,275
still has this moral compass.

481
00:38:16,855 --> 00:38:18,735
So there there is no canon.

482
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,290
Sc mc

483
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:30,671
in these comics. But I would say that that that one, which appeared in uncle Scrooge number one, is the closest that you get. Right? Because it kind of set Barks

484
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:38,990
blueprint. So so Barks was happy to change his characters around alter them as he saw fit. And for this,

485
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:54,592
this little span of stories here, you know, you also did race to the south seas with me right, where he had hired kind of some people that he viewed his savages again to protect him. So we're in this relatively brief window. Where he's like this robber Barks

486
00:38:55,548 --> 00:38:59,235
and his point is to be greedy and un.

487
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:02,921
And later, his point is to be greedy,

488
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:24,980
but self made in a more noble way. So this this story has given a lot of people pause. You know, I i... This is a big digress, but Don Rosa is kind of regarded as, like, Carl Barks ear. And he did a really big project called the life and times of sc Ducktales he kinda went back and he tried to

489
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:26,738
kind of converge

490
00:39:27,077 --> 00:39:27,277
Al

491
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:32,571
all of the details that were referenced in the Barks stories

492
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:36,105
about how sc made his fortune and make this really

493
00:39:36,685 --> 00:39:37,185
sprawling,

494
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:38,185
fascinating

495
00:39:38,645 --> 00:39:39,880
story of this

496
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,748
Scottish kid who immigrated and made his fortune.

497
00:39:44,165 --> 00:39:48,630
And, you know, Rosa talks a lot about how he was gonna deal with Voodoo Who.

498
00:39:49,124 --> 00:39:54,667
And he talks in in his notes about, you know, he debated throwing it out.

499
00:39:55,385 --> 00:39:56,802
And then he decided

500
00:39:57,139 --> 00:39:58,557
that it was gonna be

501
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:04,804
sc one bad act that he always regret. And, you know, we can talk about

502
00:40:05,223 --> 00:40:20,550
I'll probably get into a later if I ever get around to those stories and talk about whether rosa should have thrown this one out, but but it's really interesting to me that, you know, he he had to really stop and think about, you know, am I gonna treat this as Canon

503
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:29,422
And again, this is a really packed page. Right? He talks about sc talks about this curse, right? That the the witch doctor

504
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,818
who was enraged at the at Sc

505
00:40:33,157 --> 00:40:38,726
theft of the land, which you know, Scrooge himself is basically acknowledging. I stole that land.

506
00:40:39,446 --> 00:40:44,541
He put a poison thorn in the doll and sent bull bomb the zombie.

507
00:40:45,014 --> 00:40:54,567
We learn his name there to track me down and that Bam has been after him for seventy years in this story. And, you know, the timeline doesn't really work, but

508
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:11,315
But yeah. The the idea is that he's been after him for a very, very long time. We also get a little bit of lore about Barks version of his zombie. Right? Zombies, zombies don't think and that they can only remember one thing at a time. I did wanna to point

509
00:41:11,695 --> 00:41:13,035
out in that final

510
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:15,485
panel on that page where

511
00:41:15,942 --> 00:41:16,762
the flashback

512
00:41:17,379 --> 00:41:23,598
young uncle sc is walking away from the witch doctor and the zombie

513
00:41:24,174 --> 00:41:42,235
and he's walking on this path and there are two two sign posts, one pointing in the direction that sc is walking and it says lightest Africa, and then the one pointing behind him where he was leaving from where the zombie and the witch doctor are says darkest Africa.

514
00:41:42,695 --> 00:41:45,395
Yeah. And he's got a very, like, colonial

515
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:47,075
pit helmet on.

516
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:54,124
So on the next page, you know, Donald, we kind of get into Donald being super worried

517
00:41:54,543 --> 00:42:00,529
about the curse and wondering, and and he's basically starting to imagine himself shrinking already.

518
00:42:00,947 --> 00:42:15,760
And, you know, Uncle Sc advises the Nephews to just give him sleep and pill, and and let him sleep it off. And, you know, we kinda transition now over to the Nephews point of view, and we're gonna get a lot of their point of view for the rest of the story.

519
00:42:16,732 --> 00:42:19,323
At this point, it it's almost a hue duty Louise story.

520
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:24,220
Because they're they're starting to get creeped out about zombies because there's

521
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:31,920
very ominous in the last panel. They're laying in bed and one of them says, say, I wonder what became of that zombie.

522
00:42:32,374 --> 00:42:38,055
And the middle nephew says shop. Now you're giving me nightmares. And you know when they're

523
00:42:38,511 --> 00:43:06,171
non cost that, like, something so. Like, because they're usually the ones who keep their wits about them. Exactly. Right? They're meant to be avatars for Barks readers. They're the young boys that are clever, imagining themselves reading this comic. So, yeah. I'm I'm getting creeped out at this point when I read this at Aj. And and it's especially the next page is super creepy. You know, we transition we see the at city hall, the police officers

524
00:43:06,804 --> 00:43:10,253
are kind of feeling helpless to do anything about the zombie

525
00:43:11,148 --> 00:43:12,941
because no one's filed Al complaint.

526
00:43:13,937 --> 00:43:14,437
And

527
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:17,210
Now we have this really cool panel

528
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,510
of bam and silhouette Barks narration panel.

529
00:43:21,965 --> 00:43:24,865
Talking about him going to the residential section

530
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:45,751
of the city and that some mysterious instinct has him stop in front of Don house where he's peace fully sn. And finally, at Dawn, you know, Donald wakes up and he's he's feeling a little bit better, Maybe he slept it off. Maybe it was all a dream. Nobody opens his eyes. He sees... He sees bam be just very placid

531
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:50,909
standing at the foot of his bed. And he lets out what is easy to imagine as an une

532
00:43:51,445 --> 00:44:00,340
sc based on the way that Barks has drawn that word balloon. That is a great page. Right? This this page is giving a very creepy

533
00:44:01,158 --> 00:44:02,258
atmosphere. And

534
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:16,476
regardless of all the all the problematic bones that it's built on. I I do like this page a lot. And so the Nephews come running on the next page base see what they figure out must be the zombie

535
00:44:17,252 --> 00:44:19,546
They start to attack him with broom,

536
00:44:19,883 --> 00:44:22,217
but Bam doesn't react to anything.

537
00:44:22,889 --> 00:44:34,270
And so they they kinda wear themselves out and they're like, okay. He doesn't doesn't seem to be a threat to us. So they asked Donald what he did, and Donald says nothing, but he gives me the creeps.

538
00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:39,337
And and the nephews figure out pretty quickly that, you know, he's actually harmless,

539
00:44:40,249 --> 00:44:43,465
One of them comments, he just looks lone some and,

540
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:47,541
you know, they figured out well, he he can't talk most likely

541
00:44:48,495 --> 00:45:05,209
He seems to be lost. And so the Nephew size him up pretty quickly. And so on the next page, you know nephews are really starting to empathize with bam there. They're figuring, you know, maybe he wants to go back to back to Africa back to his voodoo people.

542
00:45:05,707 --> 00:45:20,095
And, you know, one of them sums it up really nicely that he's been trying to deliver this doll for seventy years now that he's completed this task. He doesn't know what to do with himself. And and, you know, one of them tears up in in empathy

543
00:45:20,755 --> 00:45:21,455
and then

544
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:26,935
surmise that he's come back to Donald because it's the only link he has with his own world and donald.

545
00:45:27,355 --> 00:45:30,749
Donald like, don't feel sympathy for him. So they...

546
00:45:31,805 --> 00:45:40,185
Why don't you go ahead and describe the rest of this page? They just grab bobby by the hand and lead him around and bomb follows them.

547
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:48,955
And and one of those says, watch how he lets me lead him around by the hand, and then another one says, maybe he understands kindness.

548
00:45:49,931 --> 00:45:52,187
And I love that so much.

549
00:45:52,804 --> 00:45:55,955
Yeah. Like, I do love a monster

550
00:45:56,495 --> 00:45:59,115
who just like, is misunderstood.

551
00:46:00,095 --> 00:46:03,635
That's a really good way to kind of

552
00:46:03,975 --> 00:46:04,475
diffuse

553
00:46:05,069 --> 00:46:22,689
any of these tense situations and and you know, in your own brain, it's a good way to take control of of your fantasy life and and where just something isn't as scary anymore. And so I thought that was a really great way to put the kids back in control And

554
00:46:23,106 --> 00:46:23,984
kind this,

555
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,637
you know I love some kindness.

556
00:46:27,173 --> 00:46:37,184
Yeah. This is a great way to diffuse it. Right? The story just got a little bit less scary. And you're right. The the, like, misunderstood monsters is a who's a great.

557
00:46:37,642 --> 00:46:40,475
Alright. Try to feed him, but he doesn't want anything to eat.

558
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:46,220
Yeah. So the Nephew become very sympathetic here. But, you know, Donald is very

559
00:46:46,757 --> 00:46:50,225
single minded on the next page. He's he's freaking out

560
00:46:50,804 --> 00:46:51,623
he's constantly

561
00:46:51,962 --> 00:46:53,939
perceiving himself as getting shorter.

562
00:46:54,636 --> 00:46:57,371
And he he resolves to ask

563
00:46:57,829 --> 00:47:03,660
sc to demand passage to Africa to see the which doctor to lift the curse.

564
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:10,195
And then the nephews kind of figure out, you know, you know, maybe there's a trip to Africa in it for us as well.

565
00:47:10,654 --> 00:47:15,150
I did think it was cute that I think I pointed this out in another

566
00:47:15,808 --> 00:47:16,988
episode where

567
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,186
Donald is

568
00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:21,113
that he's wearing a towel

569
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:34,598
that hover up the areas that his clothes usually don't cover up That's right. And somehow he feels modest that way. Oh yeah. And and that's not just a Barks thing. Just kinda how

570
00:47:34,976 --> 00:47:41,441
everyone who works with Donald treats him. You can see him in the cartoons putting wrapping a towel around his lower half.

571
00:47:42,213 --> 00:47:43,151
Alright. So

572
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:45,861
on the next page and very un,

573
00:47:46,716 --> 00:47:57,350
uncle Scrooge immediately agrees to pay to have him go to Africa. And, you know, Donald is in this pose of, like, both terror and sup and he's just looking desperate.

574
00:47:57,804 --> 00:48:06,895
And sc points out that you know, I'd certainly rather pay your fair to africa than have you haunting me the rest of your life with your imaginary who do.

575
00:48:07,748 --> 00:48:09,564
Yeah. And they're flooding that. But...

576
00:48:10,261 --> 00:48:13,274
But he gives him the price for a single ticket

577
00:48:13,811 --> 00:48:14,205
to

578
00:48:14,785 --> 00:48:24,380
and when Donald gets back and and let's the... Let's the kids down by saying, only he can go. The kids, you know, they have a little bit of a tantrum

579
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:35,975
and Bam has some some sympathy tears. And Donald, you know, packs Al little carpet bag and immediately leaves the boys all alone while he's gonna be in Africa for weeks.

580
00:48:36,615 --> 00:48:40,569
With no no more advice than keep the lawn mode and the tu water.

581
00:48:41,308 --> 00:48:43,886
That's such bad parenting.

582
00:48:44,944 --> 00:48:45,723
I felt

583
00:48:46,103 --> 00:48:57,259
I felt so bad because that was the first time I've ever seen the boys get upset. It is, but it's also it happens enough in these stories that I think it's meant to be like a little bit of an audience

584
00:48:57,597 --> 00:49:07,463
empowerment. Right? Like, I I trust the kids to be home by themselves. Because there are times you know Al lot of these that the Nephews will do very adult things like drive Barks.

585
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:18,957
Let's be nothing of how often they saved donald. So the Nephews wear themselves crying, and they decide that they're gonna take zombie into town to see about getting him

586
00:49:19,296 --> 00:49:20,276
back to Africa.

587
00:49:21,054 --> 00:49:24,725
And they dressed him up in some pretty pretty ridiculous clothes

588
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:27,038
One of them is like a very old

589
00:49:27,415 --> 00:49:36,070
military ga or something. And and the Nephews, they kinda get distracted talking about the situation. And before they realize that they have

590
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:40,230
Zombie by the time they get to the immigration office,

591
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:46,427
cracks me out that they think that the immigration office can maybe do something for him. But

592
00:49:47,203 --> 00:49:49,196
but, yeah, they they lose sight of bam.

593
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,310
So the kids on the next page they backtrack

594
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:53,230
and

595
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,510
follow a crowd of people

596
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:58,965
into a broadcast studio which turns out to be the

597
00:49:59,623 --> 00:50:11,560
a taping of the Perk Peanut quiz show, and they do notice Mom on the stage with contestants, so they sit down to watch. And and we've got this, like very late forties

598
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:15,520
radio host who who's quite a character.

599
00:50:16,195 --> 00:50:20,810
And this is a very, like high concept to very over the top sequence

600
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:24,286
right where he is going to

601
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,218
give some quiz questions

602
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:34,899
to Zombie and we got that like comedy of errors where by not answering by not saying anything he is he's gonna correctly

603
00:50:35,437 --> 00:50:47,513
win the quiz show and by the end. By the end of the next page, he's gonna win the grand prize of a wheelbarrow full of money. So thus securing his and the kids passage

604
00:50:48,024 --> 00:50:50,161
to to Africa. And and

605
00:50:50,898 --> 00:50:57,880
it's it's pretty funny. It's it's very silly. It's a good little device to get them on their way to Africa,

606
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,800
you know, really over the top wealthy

607
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,840
manner.

608
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:10,170
So any comments for for that and the next page? I'm looking up the exchange rate for he because he wins

609
00:51:10,629 --> 00:51:12,407
one one hundred dollars.

610
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:14,380
Mh. That first question.

611
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,020
Right. Is a red.

612
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,460
Which is about, you know, a thousand

613
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,060
fifty dollars

614
00:51:21,454 --> 00:51:25,982
And who can look up the exchange rate for a wheelbarrow phone of money because

615
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:39,474
we they're full of pennies is different from... But but it's a nationwide contest. So, you know, obviously enough fair to get them to Africa in grand style and then to have these these problematic

616
00:51:39,812 --> 00:51:47,740
wide of cash around to just grease the wheels on their way. Alright. So we transition to Africa where Don just arrived

617
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,300
And, you know, he is kinda thinking about how pretty it is there.

618
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,020
He's thinking about how little money he has to survive on while he

619
00:51:58,092 --> 00:51:59,470
looks for the witch doctor.

620
00:51:59,807 --> 00:52:03,499
And then before he leaves the airport, everyone's attention

621
00:52:03,956 --> 00:52:10,983
turns to another plane. Do you wanna describe the the next plain Sarah? It's quite a bit larger

622
00:52:11,442 --> 00:52:11,942
than

623
00:52:12,441 --> 00:52:12,941
Mcdonald's

624
00:52:13,334 --> 00:52:13,834
little

625
00:52:14,251 --> 00:52:18,817
dink puddle jumper. Oh, you know what some some very enthusiastic

626
00:52:19,633 --> 00:52:20,133
listener

627
00:52:20,589 --> 00:52:21,980
has actually been

628
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:32,686
emailing me or commenting on the Facebook page, rather, he seems to be very interested in aviation and the Carl Barks comics. And he's been sharing with me

629
00:52:33,144 --> 00:52:36,135
the the names of some of these planes.

630
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:39,785
Nice. Intriguing. Listener Rubin Al

631
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:51,035
has been sharing information about these planes. And the plane that the du arrive in is a Boeing b fifty two, which is the only eight engine

632
00:52:51,412 --> 00:52:53,786
aircraft that have been produced regular

633
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:59,640
Donald to rise and he's getting off his plane. He has a surprisingly human looking

634
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:00,680
steward.

635
00:53:01,474 --> 00:53:03,250
I noticed. But he...

636
00:53:03,628 --> 00:53:04,128
The

637
00:53:04,585 --> 00:53:14,829
announcements go on at the airfield field and clear the one way special chartered super luxury liner coming in from Erica with eight engines and Silver fox upholstery.

638
00:53:15,645 --> 00:53:21,903
Great detail. One two three, four, how do you even get eight engines? I'm just that sounds pretty.

639
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,176
And given that they took off quite a bit later than Donald did,

640
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:30,066
you know, those eight engines would definitely

641
00:53:30,603 --> 00:53:39,298
make them arrive only a few minutes afterward afterwards. That's. And then Donald decides that the... He's gonna stick around and see what that is. And

642
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:42,527
it's the kids and bomb the zombie

643
00:53:43,143 --> 00:53:43,643
and

644
00:53:43,981 --> 00:53:49,730
the kids are all dressed up like, fancy, putting on the roots guys with the

645
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:59,827
cans and white spots and bam, the zombie. They have all have top hats, and money, of course, is flying everywhere because that's what happens when you're that wealthy.

646
00:54:00,545 --> 00:54:03,517
Right. And and it's... I think it's very thoughtful.

647
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:12,871
That they have secured a a rich ty outfit for Bam as well. It's definitely an upgrade from the... Outfit that they had

648
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:20,967
secured for him in the previous page Right. Yeah. So they did what they could. And I like the little gag where one of the arm

649
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,260
says must be some fabulous rich potato. I mean, ten.

650
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,700
I've never heard the word pot ten

651
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,594
outside of a few of these Barks comics.

652
00:54:32,412 --> 00:54:37,827
The landing wheels have leopard skin tires. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. So

653
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:55,205
there's a narration box that does a lot of work here. Right? It says money Barks and soon bam fortune topped up a whole safari complete with folding bathtub and eager to plunge into the African bush. So you know, they're gonna stop off at sc rubber

654
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,147
rubber plantation which, you know, they nickname nicknamed Scrooge

655
00:54:59,506 --> 00:55:06,563
on the latex. That's a fun gag. And there's, you know, it's a neat little panel of them try traveling with the lion kind of in the distance.

656
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:13,435
When they talk to the manager at the Rubber plantation, he basically warns him off. He says that

657
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:20,589
they're hidden very well, the police can't find him and they they terror the locals every few weeks.

658
00:55:21,204 --> 00:55:26,944
And when Donald says he has to ask him a favor, the the manager basically wishes him

659
00:55:27,364 --> 00:55:30,119
by and says it was nice knowing you. And

660
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:33,192
I'm not gonna go too deeply into it, but

661
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:35,107
the history of

662
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:35,945
European

663
00:55:36,482 --> 00:55:37,262
and Americans

664
00:55:38,775 --> 00:55:39,835
getting rubber

665
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:41,434
in Central Africa

666
00:55:41,934 --> 00:55:44,275
is is really, really brutal.

667
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:48,710
And and the fact that Sc has a rubber plantation out here...

668
00:55:50,109 --> 00:55:51,329
One of the more horrific

669
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:57,302
chapters in colonialism is what the belgian did in in the quote Belgian Congo,

670
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,000
extracting rubber.

671
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:00,099
So

672
00:56:00,478 --> 00:56:03,475
you don't wanna be involved with Rubber and Central Africa.

673
00:56:04,008 --> 00:56:04,907
Alright. So

674
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:07,458
i'm embarking on their

675
00:56:07,795 --> 00:56:15,571
safari, you know, they get deeper into the bush and donald has a conversation with one of the

676
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:19,979
with the leader of the Safari. You know, the the

677
00:56:20,558 --> 00:56:32,328
expedition leader is kind of caution them they need to camp out, and then they'll they'll head closer to where the village is believed to be the next day, and he's very... He's very fearful

678
00:56:32,865 --> 00:56:36,477
and says that, you know, we can't let the the Voodoo villagers

679
00:56:37,308 --> 00:56:38,606
see us first.

680
00:56:38,943 --> 00:56:39,683
In the

681
00:56:40,379 --> 00:56:44,468
reprint that I read as a kid, you know, they omit his little boo

682
00:56:44,885 --> 00:56:45,385
lo,

683
00:56:45,723 --> 00:56:49,714
which is like, something that basically people imagined,

684
00:56:50,214 --> 00:56:55,649
you know, uneducated black saying. Yeah. Isn't not supposed to be an African

685
00:56:56,386 --> 00:56:57,485
from Africa.

686
00:56:57,823 --> 00:56:58,882
Why is he using...

687
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:08,158
Right. Yeah. It's definitely. African American vernacular English. Yeah. It doesn't fit. Really. Or like, you know, a bastard prioritization of a v?

688
00:57:08,495 --> 00:57:10,552
Yeah. Exactly. And and so

689
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:21,755
while the Safari is at rest, suddenly an arrow stripes the tree behind them with one of the Voodoo dolls dangling from it, and it makes there...

690
00:57:22,675 --> 00:57:24,974
Everyone is just immensely terrified.

691
00:57:25,714 --> 00:57:34,140
And on the next page, you see the whole safari just fleeing in terror for their lives. So, you know, the Ducktales have been abandoned.

692
00:57:34,837 --> 00:58:03,104
They are on their own in the African bus. They see they realize, you know, that the voodoo village knows that they're here and, you know, the nephews are debating whether they should turn back. And and I guess, I I like that, you know, he's creating some real tension here but it also is kinda depicting these people as, like, basically easily scared. That's not a great representation. No. And they have the the white

693
00:58:03,739 --> 00:58:06,279
around their their mouths kind of min

694
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:09,599
depiction. And are they African?

695
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:11,654
Are they African

696
00:58:11,993 --> 00:58:24,259
Americans. Are they just like, people who've decided that like, oh, I'm a local, but I'm afraid of this other local because he's so fierce, and that's how we're supposed to interpret how fearsome.

697
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:25,079
Right.

698
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,751
Whatever his name is, it who are these people?

699
00:58:29,168 --> 00:58:39,409
Yeah. I think I think these are the non voodoo villagers. Right? And and this is kind of Barks raising the stakes. To show us how ferocious this other

700
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:44,045
feared people are. And you know, their depiction is basic

701
00:58:44,544 --> 00:58:53,730
like, this is what all the creators were doing. It was it was a trope. It was as good of an example as a trope of a trope as you can find almost. Right? Because

702
00:58:54,507 --> 00:58:56,044
This care doesn't

703
00:58:56,581 --> 00:59:00,271
reflect reality at all. But this is just

704
00:59:00,609 --> 00:59:07,511
how comic all comic creators. Somehow this like filtered out to everyone. Right? I read Asterisk

705
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:20,745
comics from this same era. This is how they were represent represented. The floyd Gottfredson Mickey Mouse comic strip from this time, this is how they were represented. And and I think this is just one of those weird universal shorthand hands

706
00:59:21,285 --> 00:59:28,625
that has dated very poorly for very obvious reasons, but wouldn't have looked weird at the time at all, because

707
00:59:28,925 --> 00:59:29,605
everyone was doing it.

708
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,800
Alright. So

709
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:37,460
on the following page, you know, they're they're just having a conversation about their next step.

710
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:42,522
They get the idea to ask Z bam to lead them to the village.

711
00:59:43,138 --> 00:59:43,638
And

712
00:59:44,773 --> 00:59:47,166
while they're having this conversation,

713
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:52,116
something over hears them from in a little tough, a little bush.

714
00:59:52,575 --> 01:00:00,805
Some voice says did I hear somebody mention zombies? I'm an authority on the subject. And we get this little reveal. This little tiny man

715
01:00:01,185 --> 01:00:06,365
steps out and says that he has just been to the hideout of old fu.

716
01:00:07,399 --> 01:00:21,490
The witch doctor. And, you know, I hadn't mentioned his name before that. And it doesn't feel great to say it out loud, but it is the name. Right? It rhymes it's catchy, it sticks in your head. It also seems to be a play on the word Zulu.

717
01:00:21,828 --> 01:00:22,985
So... And cool.

718
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:34,719
And fool. But I don't think fool like Idiot. Right? I think fool like fool you. Right? Like trick you, like like he's crafty and con ivan. That's my read on it of.

719
01:00:35,278 --> 01:00:37,016
I could see both arguments

720
01:00:37,435 --> 01:00:37,795
standing.

721
01:00:38,729 --> 01:00:46,582
So this is this is kind of a cool reveal. You know, this is what they used for the cover image, basically the Ducktales

722
01:00:46,462 --> 01:00:49,874
boggling at meeting this tiny little man. And we immediately

723
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:51,668
understand that he's been victim

724
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:54,420
by the same curse that Donald has.

725
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:59,822
And he He goes on to introduce himself as Cornelius Mac.

726
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:02,037
He's a researcher from the University of

727
01:01:03,234 --> 01:01:03,734
And

728
01:01:04,113 --> 01:01:05,744
he he says that

729
01:01:06,523 --> 01:01:10,815
while he's kinda sitting down and we get some cool little details of

730
01:01:12,431 --> 01:01:17,299
insects next to him, while he's sitting on a twig, he talks about how he came to research

731
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,019
Voodoo science.

732
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:29,869
So this is kind of Barks veer a little bit from the magic aspect to the science aspect of it. Because he generally liked to not leave these things Al supernatural.

733
01:01:30,249 --> 01:01:30,409
You know.

734
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:44,124
Everyone while there was a supernatural element to these stories, but for the most part, it was explained. He thought that he had be friend the witch doctor, but one day he gave him a doll and told him to squeeze it, and we know what happens. And

735
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:45,083
he

736
01:01:45,542 --> 01:02:00,960
reveals to Donald that, you know, he he still has a day to go based on his understanding of the timeline of the Voodoo drug. So the professor really interesting. Right? I feel like he leaves a big impact for the, like, three or so pages that he's on.

737
01:02:01,972 --> 01:02:06,938
Because he's like, become a convert to his his shrunk and lifestyle. He's ex

738
01:02:07,316 --> 01:02:10,807
how how little resources he needs to live

739
01:02:11,518 --> 01:02:14,173
he's really excited to be

740
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:18,163
small. I... I'm I'm gonna say that he does not have a family

741
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:19,081
because

742
01:02:19,474 --> 01:02:21,627
I don't think they're gonna be as excited about it.

743
01:02:22,545 --> 01:02:39,082
But but don... They were millennials, they would be so stoked to be able to build a mansion out of a trunk Oh, yeah. Absolutely Millennial dream is just to own any property at all. So, like, to build a a whole house out of a truck. Yeah. I have

744
01:02:39,499 --> 01:02:40,557
my beating heart.

745
01:02:43,048 --> 01:02:49,980
Donald is not sold though, and he snatch the map. That the professor helpful draws for him

746
01:02:50,636 --> 01:02:54,975
using a pencil that's taller than he is. And and as they're about to leave, he

747
01:02:55,315 --> 01:02:55,815
comments

748
01:02:56,395 --> 01:03:07,030
and onto to the next page, you know, don't don't let that zombie fool you. He's not really quote done for or dead as some of the reprint correct. And he's just been drugged.

749
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:10,710
He doesn't need to sleep or eat or feel anything.

750
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:25,558
And again, he's like, suggesting all in all. They're very well off. You know, this is a horrifying condition of course to be in. So but but we know that this guy's excited about being size of rat. Maybe he's not the the most reliable narrator.

751
01:03:26,174 --> 01:03:30,582
It's it's fine to take their agency. They're fine. Don't worry about it.

752
01:03:31,095 --> 01:03:41,967
Sure. And he indicates that, you know, after several centuries, the drug wears off and they'll they'll be normal people again, and and the kids are very sweet they're very excited for him being a man with a future.

753
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:53,155
You know, I'm not sure how well his future is gonna go waking up and you know, say, twenty twenty one or whatever and having it work where often offense and family are all all gone.

754
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:56,350
Anyway, the Ducktales eventually

755
01:03:56,690 --> 01:04:18,894
arrive at the hidden village, you know, which is like a classic pal aide wall. And when they bang on the door, trap door opens up beneath him and they're kind of secretive forward along this dark tunnel and when when it's not dark anymore, they appear right before last time Fu Z

756
01:04:19,311 --> 01:04:19,550
himself,

757
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:22,662
who greet them by saying, good afternoon,

758
01:04:23,161 --> 01:04:30,787
Scrooge mc duck. And the witch doctor is like terrifying here. Right, Sarah. You know, he really is.

759
01:04:31,484 --> 01:04:33,102
The the whole min,

760
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:38,265
like, white mouth thing is is often done to make

761
01:04:38,844 --> 01:04:40,860
make black people seem

762
01:04:41,238 --> 01:04:42,177
less intelligent

763
01:04:42,515 --> 01:04:44,053
and maybe... Last

764
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:47,087
less threatening more emotional

765
01:04:47,919 --> 01:04:48,898
than rational,

766
01:04:49,316 --> 01:04:50,554
I think in a lot of ways,

767
01:04:51,152 --> 01:04:53,608
But the way that they've drawn his eye

768
01:04:53,986 --> 01:05:01,044
eyebrows and the his other face paint and his tea, the especially is kind of pointy teeth. And then he's also

769
01:05:01,421 --> 01:05:07,637
got these snakes wrapped around his arms and he's kind of taking that, like, feet together

770
01:05:07,973 --> 01:05:09,908
kind of butterfly pose

771
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:13,911
and his hands are clasp in front of him, Like, he's just like,

772
01:05:14,645 --> 01:05:15,145
Yes.

773
01:05:15,525 --> 01:05:17,865
You know, if if he were Barks, he would be

774
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:24,712
tapping his fingertips at each other. Yeah. And on the next page. He's kind of leaning forward, like a vulture.

775
01:05:25,248 --> 01:05:27,981
So he he's he's truly terrifying

776
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:37,237
and and that's what Barks was going for. Right? So like, I would say it's both an offensive car, but also like a very successful.

777
01:05:37,996 --> 01:05:44,574
Because he's scary. And and he has very sharpened teeth in this one. They kinda corrected that in later

778
01:05:44,912 --> 01:05:45,412
printing,

779
01:05:46,308 --> 01:05:46,808
censored

780
01:05:47,145 --> 01:05:48,935
slash corrected, whatever you wanna

781
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:55,271
whatever your point of view is. I also get a little bit of clear coding. In the way that

782
01:05:55,767 --> 01:05:56,267
jafar

783
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:57,199
and

784
01:05:57,937 --> 01:05:59,035
scar have these

785
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:01,230
very kind of like pointed

786
01:06:02,247 --> 01:06:03,984
eyebrows that is

787
01:06:04,801 --> 01:06:09,706
them. A little bit. Yeah. And and and he's he's just

788
01:06:10,084 --> 01:06:13,297
super loved on. Oh, oh, the other thing. Right? Is that he's

789
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,228
he does not speak with

790
01:06:17,366 --> 01:06:17,866
dialogue

791
01:06:18,445 --> 01:06:18,925
at all.

792
01:06:19,844 --> 01:06:22,542
Oh that's a good point. He's very

793
01:06:22,881 --> 01:06:23,355
sharp

794
01:06:24,093 --> 01:06:25,391
maybe the smartest.

795
01:06:25,968 --> 01:06:29,980
Maybe this absolutely the smartest person there. Yeah. Absolutely.

796
01:06:30,756 --> 01:06:31,036
Right.

797
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:34,307
So, you know, Donald on the next page

798
01:06:34,726 --> 01:06:41,355
is is taken him aback. He's like, I'm not Scrooge. I'm just some guy who looks like him sc is very old,

799
01:06:41,855 --> 01:06:43,115
you know, and and

800
01:06:43,495 --> 01:06:44,435
the witch doctor

801
01:06:44,815 --> 01:06:55,100
considers this and realizes with disgust that he's right, and Donald, you know, explains what happened that he got the curse intended for sp mc du.

802
01:06:55,953 --> 01:06:59,926
He points out he never did anything to hurt you. And,

803
01:07:00,264 --> 01:07:04,076
you know, the which doctor acknowledges that this mistake has been made

804
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:08,410
He is shrewd and he is villainous so he

805
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:13,350
wed with him, You know, how much is it worth for you to be saved by me.

806
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:21,136
The nephews step in, and they pull out several watts of zombie of bomb fortune.

807
01:07:21,669 --> 01:07:26,517
And ask, is it worth this much? Mister Z, they say,

808
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:28,432
and and he

809
01:07:28,864 --> 01:07:32,355
rifles the the why that says twenty thousand dollars.

810
01:07:32,892 --> 01:07:38,536
I guess, the only time he does say wow, that might be a little bit of a character, but he says

811
01:07:39,048 --> 01:07:43,713
that that for that comfortable fee, I am very willing to d voodoo y.

812
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:47,482
It's it's kind of funny dialogue, but again, it's

813
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:49,294
Two separate religions.

814
01:07:49,753 --> 01:07:50,253
Yeah.

815
01:07:51,990 --> 01:08:02,580
And and so, you know, he goes on to say, you know, as a matter of Barks. You don't really have anything to worry about because in all honesty, the doll lost its power many years ago.

816
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:09,644
So Donald feels much better he instantly knows he can be happy again. He doesn't have to worry.

817
01:08:10,482 --> 01:08:13,217
And as he is leaving, he very

818
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:14,270
foolishly

819
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:15,830
says

820
01:08:16,571 --> 01:08:22,625
goodbye to the witch doctor and tells the kids we've got a swell story to tell uncle Scrooge.

821
01:08:23,145 --> 01:08:24,765
I I love the panel

822
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:30,465
of the witch doctor processing that he just said uncle I like his expression there.

823
01:08:31,158 --> 01:08:33,932
And you know, Donald is is very proud

824
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:37,736
of being Scrooge as nearest living relative, but

825
01:08:38,316 --> 01:08:42,296
when they learn that, of course, they immediately grab on to him

826
01:08:42,635 --> 01:08:49,377
and which doctor explains that it's its voodoo law that the nearest of Kin Gladstone

827
01:08:49,475 --> 01:08:55,990
for the sins of a wrong doe. And he immediately starts to make a new batch of super shrink.

828
01:08:56,667 --> 01:09:03,161
That just seems like I mean, I didn't look up to see whether that is a true tenant of

829
01:09:03,579 --> 01:09:06,392
Voodoo or who do or any of the

830
01:09:07,407 --> 01:09:12,191
religions that they are based on? I It's definitely meant to be min.

831
01:09:12,886 --> 01:09:16,725
It's definitely supposed to cast them as evil.

832
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:20,906
Right. What what do you call that? What's the term for for

833
01:09:21,286 --> 01:09:22,881
someone else taking

834
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:24,716
taking a person's punishment.

835
01:09:25,214 --> 01:09:30,423
That's that's something that we tend to view is, like, very coward and very evil.

836
01:09:30,935 --> 01:09:36,270
So the Ne user are talking with the witch doctor while he is making up the potion.

837
01:09:37,049 --> 01:09:39,081
You know, I find it interesting that they don't

838
01:09:39,461 --> 01:09:41,439
they don't capture the nephews or anything.

839
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:44,475
They're they're just left to their own devices.

840
01:09:45,374 --> 01:09:50,121
There's this very men panel where which doctor brandi is the potion

841
01:09:50,499 --> 01:09:53,491
and says this time, the medicine will be fresh,

842
01:09:54,329 --> 01:09:55,007
very scary.

843
01:09:55,620 --> 01:10:01,942
And they escape over the pal wall and they are stopped by a Village

844
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:06,343
who brandi a spear at them. And and

845
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:10,927
just kinda casually and men seemingly Barks them going shopping.

846
01:10:11,303 --> 01:10:12,241
And one of the nephews

847
01:10:12,738 --> 01:10:17,311
says, Yes. Will you sell us the spear for ten thousand dollars?

848
01:10:17,911 --> 01:10:25,872
And so it's very interesting here that, like, money solves all their problems. Right? Money is their weapon for the rest of this story.

849
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:33,803
And it's not even their money. Like, not only are these people super greedy in a way that they probably aren't

850
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:37,983
in those regions in real life in those but they're just like...

851
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:43,168
Bobby hasn't it doesn't have any agency of his own. We're just gonna spend his money for him.

852
01:10:43,527 --> 01:10:48,322
Right. I I guess one could argue, you know, that they're helping him out by returning

853
01:10:48,981 --> 01:10:49,882
to his homeland.

854
01:10:50,342 --> 01:10:51,402
It's a very pate

855
01:10:51,942 --> 01:10:52,962
view, but

856
01:10:53,677 --> 01:10:59,496
But again, I'll just point that out. Because I do like, you know, we're we're men to identify with the nephews.

857
01:11:00,197 --> 01:11:03,591
So I won't overlook their their blind spots but

858
01:11:03,971 --> 01:11:05,991
they definitely come out better

859
01:11:06,491 --> 01:11:14,406
than Donald or sp in this story. It is a little bit off putting that in the next panel at the top of the next page,

860
01:11:14,946 --> 01:11:20,421
that man says ten thousand dollars for that kind of money. You can buy me too

861
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:21,979
which is just

862
01:11:22,357 --> 01:11:23,455
so cri

863
01:11:24,392 --> 01:11:26,608
considering that... Right. Owning

864
01:11:27,105 --> 01:11:27,605
African

865
01:11:28,223 --> 01:11:28,936
men is

866
01:11:29,396 --> 01:11:30,455
considering the legacy.

867
01:11:31,114 --> 01:11:31,614
Yeah.

868
01:11:32,472 --> 01:11:36,821
Right. So as a kid, I I thought that was just

869
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:43,866
hilarious style on. I thought that was so funny because it it was so absurd to me. Right? I didn't

870
01:11:44,365 --> 01:11:56,651
it didn't immediately dawn on me that that might be a reference to slavery and and it's never, you know, directly mentioned. It's just something that you can't help but think about as a cro adults.

871
01:11:57,451 --> 01:12:06,042
But I find it fascinating that I've transitioned from having that reaction. I what I'm surge statement. That's so funny. Yeah. Who

872
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:13,168
as you say, just utterly cri when I read this one. And you know, would it have been

873
01:12:13,867 --> 01:12:19,221
absurd? Would it have been, oh, this is nowhere near reality and therefore funny.

874
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:26,609
To a a reader in nineteen forty nine. Right? Yeah. And I mean, it hasn't been too many pages since they

875
01:12:27,188 --> 01:12:28,626
commissioned the whole safari.

876
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,259
Full of Africans.

877
01:12:30,636 --> 01:12:36,242
And and they were paying them. But but I I can't imagine it was, like the kind of wage

878
01:12:36,956 --> 01:12:39,416
They did give them top hats. Yeah.

879
01:12:40,316 --> 01:12:53,542
And and, you know, the guy called called Him b. Which which is the sw word for master. So that was... you know, that was the common trope for Safari though. So anyway, this this village

880
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:59,781
says that he's heading to cape town to go shopping kind of loaded. Right? Because Cape town is South Africa

881
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:08,393
one of the only white controlled places in Africa and probably thousands of miles away. So the nephews user are free to go help Donald

882
01:13:08,864 --> 01:13:14,346
they need to keep track of the moon because the witch doctor is gonna perform this

883
01:13:14,683 --> 01:13:16,511
spell Al that its zenith

884
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:22,785
this is where I learned the word zenith. So I thought that was cool. They run all the way back to sc,

885
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:31,746
but they discovered that there's no one available to help because a note says the whole crew has gone to a movie in Lamb jam. And they've left everything

886
01:13:32,164 --> 01:13:48,120
thoroughly padlock lots. They can't find any good weapons here at all. They do like their rhyme scheme. Don't they. Yeah. Sparks will use a lot of these Rhyme skiing. There it's sticky. Right? It's memorable. It's funny. I'm I'm I'm there for it.

887
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:54,476
Definitely. I'm not sure about W jumbo though because or w jam or whatever.

888
01:13:54,893 --> 01:13:57,762
Jumbo was a is a sw healing greeting. Yes.

889
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:11,717
And so he's taking these words. I mean, it's not just like random syllables. He's... I'm off a good rhyme, but... Right. And and to be completely fair he'll do this in in every language,

890
01:14:12,336 --> 01:14:13,915
including European ones,

891
01:14:14,733 --> 01:14:17,966
but it definitely comes off with that like, African ease

892
01:14:18,266 --> 01:14:18,766
connotation.

893
01:14:19,266 --> 01:14:26,066
So on the next page, you know, out of frustration, they kick one of the slabs of rubber that's lying around the plantation.

894
01:14:26,521 --> 01:14:30,901
And it just bounces all over the place upsets the pile of them,

895
01:14:31,641 --> 01:14:40,485
and they know that they bounce like their crazy and now they have this moment of realization that, you know, maybe they they have some kind of tool that they can use.

896
01:14:40,964 --> 01:14:44,636
They each haul a slab of rubber and head back into the bush.

897
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:46,030
And we

898
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:51,623
transitioned to Donald back in the village. He is in a bull pen

899
01:14:52,002 --> 01:14:55,516
awaiting his fate, and he's just kinda stew in his own misery.

900
01:14:56,496 --> 01:15:00,356
Cursing himself for bragging about Scrooge being his uncle.

901
01:15:01,071 --> 01:15:02,648
And waiting to be...

902
01:15:03,585 --> 01:15:06,840
I I do like his his little in invitation,

903
01:15:07,338 --> 01:15:10,252
then I'll be shrunk to a size to fit my brain.

904
01:15:12,142 --> 01:15:13,880
Yeah. I did like how

905
01:15:14,657 --> 01:15:21,560
the kids... I just... you know, I love kindness. I love cooperation. I love these kids and how they're all,

906
01:15:21,979 --> 01:15:31,258
hey, you know, at the same time. Yeah. They get the same idea. They barely have to communicate it. And they're on the same page and they're like, yeah. Let's go with it.

907
01:15:31,776 --> 01:15:37,311
That's a good point. Right? The kids always have a lot of, like, empathy with each other throughout this

908
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:40,588
story. It's kinda one of the bright spots in. Yeah.

909
01:15:41,087 --> 01:15:46,601
And, you know... On the next page, Donald is just feeling ever more sorry for himself.

910
01:15:48,096 --> 01:15:54,356
At one point he starts crying out loud. Daisy won't love me anymore and he starts to sa

911
01:15:54,670 --> 01:16:02,294
which is very sad. Right? Like, when when the fact that he thinks that because he's shrunk, he's not gonna merit being loved.

912
01:16:03,093 --> 01:16:08,182
Alright. So So which doctor poke his head through an opening, and he says,

913
01:16:09,021 --> 01:16:16,568
now are you sorry or rich uncle drove us from our Voodoo lands? And Donald just says, no. And if it's

914
01:16:17,067 --> 01:16:24,487
going to be any comfort to you to know it, I'm gonna punch your fat nose. Just a terrible exchange. Two people being terrible

915
01:16:24,824 --> 01:16:31,881
to each other. I mean, the the witch doctor has been, like, incredibly wrong. Right? Like, their lands were stolen.

916
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,201
Right. And and there's not...

917
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:36,521
He's he's no awful.

918
01:16:36,981 --> 01:16:38,776
And he's been wrong. It's just

919
01:16:39,355 --> 01:16:48,497
it's not a sympathetic depiction at all. It's yes he's he's like the kill mon of this story. Right? Like, He's not wrong.

920
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:51,646
Right. But his methods

921
01:16:52,142 --> 01:16:53,160
are questionable.

922
01:16:53,855 --> 01:16:54,772
Yeah. Yes.

923
01:16:55,265 --> 01:16:59,198
You know, you you... No we we all have to think about how we benefited

924
01:16:59,696 --> 01:17:06,321
from the wrong our ancestors did. But in this case, don't really hasn't it benefited

925
01:17:06,701 --> 01:17:09,361
because Uncle fur is such a to him.

926
01:17:10,661 --> 01:17:14,934
Yeah. He he dies so it certainly grease his wheels

927
01:17:15,393 --> 01:17:31,765
sometimes. And he... And he has benefited in this story in his pride. Right? It's since a pride. But other than that, no. So anyway... Yeah. Like, they should be on the same team. Like, they should just be buddies and be like, you know what? Let's team up and take some of those quad.

928
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:40,050
And there was that moment when they first encountered each other where the which doctor was, like, not going to, like, mindless

929
01:17:40,429 --> 01:17:45,843
attack him if he wasn't a threat. Right? Like, he was like, oh, you're just someone who's...

930
01:17:46,622 --> 01:17:47,376
My my

931
01:17:47,874 --> 01:17:59,072
my read of is that he was gonna see what he could sc and let him go, free. So so he was sympathetic up until the point. Where he was going to raise gonna do this.

932
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:05,432
Mh. So the nephews arrive and they get set up with their rubber slabs.

933
01:18:06,165 --> 01:18:08,504
And, you know, this is a very tense

934
01:18:08,962 --> 01:18:14,636
scene where the timing is everything, and and this is pretty cool. I think this is a neat part of the story.

935
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:15,790
Where

936
01:18:16,127 --> 01:18:21,374
the which doctor waiting for the moon to reach its zenith before he forces Donald

937
01:18:21,712 --> 01:18:22,186
to

938
01:18:22,646 --> 01:18:27,226
squeeze the new doll. The nephews setting up in a tree outside the stock,

939
01:18:27,686 --> 01:18:38,241
they tie themselves to the rubber slab as the witch Ducktales counting down on the clock, they start to bounce into the pal aid and right at the moment.

940
01:18:38,736 --> 01:18:42,072
Where he's supposed to conduct the new curse,

941
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:44,948
they snatched donald and bounce

942
01:18:45,406 --> 01:18:45,906
away

943
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,438
to safety. Mh.

944
01:18:47,975 --> 01:18:48,475
And

945
01:18:49,172 --> 01:18:52,983
on the next page, they continue to bounce out the the villagers

946
01:18:54,136 --> 01:19:02,536
set off after them. And, you know, they're they're definitely not out of danger. They have to spur away, but they take the rubber slabs in case they're useful.

947
01:19:03,668 --> 01:19:11,267
Donald leads them up to a steep path that the villagers will have to come single file. And so they're in pretty big trouble. Because they're

948
01:19:11,724 --> 01:19:15,429
they're armed with those beers. But just then, they

949
01:19:15,806 --> 01:19:19,218
they see that the that bomb has tracked them down.

950
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:20,135
And

951
01:19:20,472 --> 01:19:22,541
Donald very excited to see him

952
01:19:23,001 --> 01:19:25,621
he starts to tie bomb

953
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:36,028
feet to the rubber slabs saying that he's doing something smart for a change, and it's about time. And so on the next page, you know, Bam

954
01:19:36,366 --> 01:19:38,701
comes in handy here,

955
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:40,351
he's going to be

956
01:19:41,091 --> 01:19:45,391
exploited by the ducks. Right? They're using him as a literal weapon.

957
01:19:45,731 --> 01:19:47,366
They push him off the cliff

958
01:19:48,465 --> 01:19:49,164
the nephews

959
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:53,558
at least have the good grace to look worried for Zombie for Bam,

960
01:19:53,977 --> 01:19:54,477
but

961
01:19:55,311 --> 01:19:59,006
he he bounces down the the hillside

962
01:19:59,704 --> 01:20:00,204
stomp

963
01:20:00,583 --> 01:20:01,523
on the villagers.

964
01:20:02,596 --> 01:20:07,956
And Donald comments, that does it. If Bam keeps on bouncing he'll flatten the whole tribe.

965
01:20:08,636 --> 01:20:09,456
He celebrates

966
01:20:10,451 --> 01:20:12,549
that he is saved from the Who.

967
01:20:13,247 --> 01:20:17,582
They can go home and spend the rest of bombay money and Nephews.

968
01:20:18,775 --> 01:20:22,485
Do you want you wanna to close this out and talk about the Nephews and Mcdonald's reflection?

969
01:20:23,163 --> 01:20:24,001
No go ahead.

970
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:26,057
The the nephews

971
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:29,071
you know, they... They... They're a little bit wi

972
01:20:29,531 --> 01:20:31,071
saying poor old, bomb.

973
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:35,111
But one of them says, you know, don't worry about him. He doesn't feel anything.

974
01:20:35,746 --> 01:20:42,919
And even if he bounces for a month, he'll still be okay. You know, and they kind of echo the professors words.

975
01:20:43,418 --> 01:20:48,251
Yeah. Zombies don't get hungry or thirsty are tired, they really have something

976
01:20:48,591 --> 01:20:53,471
Donald just comments, they can take it. They can have it. I'll take Vanilla.

977
01:20:53,966 --> 01:20:55,226
And, you know, it's this

978
01:20:55,606 --> 01:20:56,106
tonal

979
01:20:57,126 --> 01:21:08,661
conclusion that that says, you know, we're not gonna worry about Bam anymore. We're gonna gonna take his money and go home. Yeah and it's just... I didn't realize that was the end.

980
01:21:09,501 --> 01:21:13,476
Right. I was I was like, oh wait. What? Well what just happened?

981
01:21:14,196 --> 01:21:17,856
Yeah. It because it it is a it's a very abrupt ending.

982
01:21:18,316 --> 01:21:26,112
Right? I I think, you know, Barks was at thirty two pages, and I don't think he ever he... There's only one time he gets to go longer than that.

983
01:21:27,364 --> 01:21:46,206
So I think he may have kind of run out of story. But we've we've got the central conflict resolved. The only thing that is kinda left. I don't I don't know about you, but right, they say that if you introduce a gun in Act one, it's gonna be fired by act three. You know, we kinda get teased with the idea that

984
01:21:46,626 --> 01:21:48,325
zombies wake up someday day

985
01:21:49,026 --> 01:21:49,541
and that

986
01:21:50,201 --> 01:22:00,550
her poll, Barks doesn't ever pull the trigger on it. He does reference that it could be hundreds of years in the future and they talk about his tu looking like it went through the sack of Rome

987
01:22:00,888 --> 01:22:01,388
sack.

988
01:22:01,806 --> 01:22:03,783
So we we know that his time

989
01:22:04,441 --> 01:22:06,436
time frame is very long.

990
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:07,710
But

991
01:22:08,447 --> 01:22:15,385
obviously, he was not interested in in bomb waking up or in Bam as a character. Bam is

992
01:22:16,204 --> 01:22:31,852
And I don't wanna forget to say, I really like Bam in this story. You know? He's very... He's obviously a problematic character tremendously problematic. But he's also very sympathetic. Right? And and and he does kinda have this like, soul full

993
01:22:33,959 --> 01:22:38,009
expression that to makes him very sympathetic. I don't know about you.

994
01:22:38,864 --> 01:22:44,528
Yeah. Considered that he's basically just an odd checked for most of the

995
01:22:44,907 --> 01:22:50,541
the comic and they just take advantage of him everybody takes advantage of him, the, you know,

996
01:22:51,274 --> 01:22:58,512
Yeah Al z takes advantage of him. The kids take advantage of his money. They don't even let him keep it. Let's go home and spend

997
01:22:58,889 --> 01:22:59,947
bobby's money

998
01:23:00,299 --> 01:23:04,547
but he's just so... He's just so down for whatever.

999
01:23:04,924 --> 01:23:05,282
Yeah.

1000
01:23:06,438 --> 01:23:13,694
Okay. I do love the, like j position of him just kind of standing there passively

1001
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:20,168
while he's bouncing on this rubber slab. You know, I imagine a real person would would be terrified

1002
01:23:20,545 --> 01:23:22,737
eyes open wide bracing themselves,

1003
01:23:23,216 --> 01:23:30,066
It's a very comic climate. Tried him bouncing these people, at least if you don't think about some of the deeper...

1004
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:34,584
You don't think of fact that he doesn't have agency

1005
01:23:34,961 --> 01:24:03,629
and he's being taken advantage of. Right. And he's being weaponized, like, like an object like you say, Right. And then and that just kind of makes you think about even now. Right. Like, you were saying earlier, like there a certain kind of humor that appealed to you as a child because you didn't know any better. But now you do and so you... Cringe at it, but there's still... We still have these bits of ourselves that are like, oh, look at this funny

1006
01:24:03,967 --> 01:24:04,467
exploited

1007
01:24:04,819 --> 01:24:06,475
black man with no agency.

1008
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:12,751
And we can still find humor in that. Right. Instead of just be totally cringey.

1009
01:24:13,325 --> 01:24:18,865
Cringey about it. Like, we have so far to go. So I mean, I I consider...

1010
01:24:19,205 --> 01:24:31,910
When I read stories like this, I can't help but reflect on that. Right? Because I'm I'm not gonna deny. I you're absolutely right. You know, enjoying some of the humor and it means that we do have far to go. But I also

1011
01:24:32,406 --> 01:24:37,169
feel like I can't I can't lie. Right? I'm steep in this culture.

1012
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:41,456
In this culture that has had this kind of storytelling

1013
01:24:42,154 --> 01:24:43,153
for so long.

1014
01:24:43,792 --> 01:24:52,485
And the the challenge with this story is that it is built on this foundation of these, you know, cultural

1015
01:24:52,822 --> 01:25:04,761
ideas that that Barks screw up in Right? I'm not sing him out. This was out pretty much everyone at the time with with some exceptions, but it is built on this foundation that is deeply racist.

1016
01:25:05,295 --> 01:25:06,473
And problematic

1017
01:25:07,011 --> 01:25:09,906
about these cultures and these religions.

1018
01:25:10,364 --> 01:25:14,057
And yet, this one has some very good artist

1019
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:15,909
and some funny

1020
01:25:16,488 --> 01:25:16,988
clever

1021
01:25:17,326 --> 01:25:18,506
creative storytelling.

1022
01:25:19,044 --> 01:25:22,021
And and I grew up with it. And it's hard to

1023
01:25:22,575 --> 01:25:28,335
It's hard to Huey,, like, divorce yourself from that. So this one has been causing me a lot of an.

1024
01:25:29,055 --> 01:25:39,160
Right? Because I don't like, how much of this story do I have to, like, throw away? How much have I grown up? And and it stresses me out a little bit to be

1025
01:25:40,032 --> 01:25:45,358
reading stories like this and releasing this podcast that has a a listeners

1026
01:25:45,735 --> 01:25:49,159
that that does tend to be older and many many people are

1027
01:25:49,937 --> 01:25:52,151
have probably read this as kids

1028
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:54,065
from maybe

1029
01:25:54,403 --> 01:25:58,252
decades further back than I did. Right? And I know for a lot of people

1030
01:25:58,645 --> 01:26:10,389
I heard from people after Volcano Valley that you know, they didn't really see anything problematic about it. And that's their that's their take on it, and that's fine, but I can't

1031
01:26:10,927 --> 01:26:16,911
read it without seeing it. And so I wanna strike the balance of of kind of appreciating

1032
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:21,666
the artist of these stories, but I'm not going to ignore

1033
01:26:22,085 --> 01:26:26,239
especially this one. You know, this this story is deeply

1034
01:26:26,739 --> 01:26:27,239
and

1035
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:28,360
profoundly

1036
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:29,320
offensive.

1037
01:26:30,672 --> 01:26:38,847
Yeah. It it is. There there are still aspects of it that I quote enjoy. But is literally

1038
01:26:39,385 --> 01:26:44,434
impossible for me to read it and enjoy the story as a whole because

1039
01:26:45,211 --> 01:26:45,871
it is

1040
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:48,876
You know, this one has had the most censoring.

1041
01:26:49,332 --> 01:26:51,126
I think of any of his stories.

1042
01:26:51,724 --> 01:27:01,851
Really. And then there's a reason for it. And again, These were these were common storytelling devices at the time. It's just that Barks has such a huge

1043
01:27:02,324 --> 01:27:10,697
such a massive collection of well regarded works that we don't always get to compare his stories to

1044
01:27:11,075 --> 01:27:11,575
anonymous

1045
01:27:12,209 --> 01:27:15,941
marvel comics writer of the Avengers number

1046
01:27:16,359 --> 01:27:19,134
thirty one or whatever that probably had

1047
01:27:19,512 --> 01:27:20,012
similarly

1048
01:27:20,844 --> 01:27:24,544
challenging content. It's just that not every work

1049
01:27:24,884 --> 01:27:51,544
kind of stands up as something to look back And I think that Barks work, I think that his stories do stand up at least in terms of their artist street and and most of the stories fortunately don't have this kind of grounding. Right? But impossible not not to talk about the problems with this one. So... Right. Thank you. I know I've been kind of kind of rambling about this one, but

1050
01:27:52,163 --> 01:27:59,255
I I really need to process this story, you know, and I I... I'm really coming down on the fact that you can't

1051
01:27:59,809 --> 01:28:00,309
responsibly

1052
01:28:00,849 --> 01:28:01,989
enjoy this one

1053
01:28:02,289 --> 01:28:08,320
without that asterisk risk and that sort of This is entertaining

1054
01:28:09,056 --> 01:28:09,556
but...

1055
01:28:10,412 --> 01:28:10,731
Right.

1056
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:14,360
Now you're talking about how Barks

1057
01:28:14,878 --> 01:28:16,176
grew up in this

1058
01:28:17,009 --> 01:28:18,949
atmosphere where this would be funny,

1059
01:28:19,249 --> 01:28:20,269
and he

1060
01:28:20,689 --> 01:28:22,309
wrote in his adulthood

1061
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:28,673
stuff based on this type of humor for kids of that era of the next generation

1062
01:28:29,211 --> 01:28:30,309
to be

1063
01:28:31,007 --> 01:28:32,026
entertained by

1064
01:28:32,339 --> 01:28:34,356
and given the reprint

1065
01:28:34,814 --> 01:28:35,314
throughout

1066
01:28:35,732 --> 01:28:37,469
the twentieth century,

1067
01:28:37,927 --> 01:28:38,787
it even

1068
01:28:39,485 --> 01:28:43,195
became part of the fabric of your childhood.

1069
01:28:43,574 --> 01:28:53,320
Have you have children of your own? Yes. And I do you see stuff like this that that perpetuate or builds upon or even is

1070
01:28:53,817 --> 01:28:54,914
still in

1071
01:28:55,291 --> 01:28:57,904
circulation from earlier times

1072
01:28:58,241 --> 01:29:13,085
when this stuff was acceptable and funny. That's that's a pretty deep profound question. I I know. Sorry. No. That's that's a great question. Right? Because I think that a lot of the culture that we

1073
01:29:13,542 --> 01:29:14,042
ingest

1074
01:29:14,539 --> 01:29:24,885
today is made by people when you're when you're kid, you're enjoying culture those made by adults. Right? Even if it like... Even if it's a kid show, it's written by adults.

1075
01:29:25,185 --> 01:29:27,085
So like, I think about the simpsons

1076
01:29:27,599 --> 01:29:31,808
which I loved growing up and read as watched as a teenager

1077
01:29:32,584 --> 01:29:36,434
right around the same time I was reading these. Right? That was written

1078
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:46,530
by thirty year olds who grew up with a lot of these, like, old sitcom ideas. Right? So even if the people that are

1079
01:29:46,909 --> 01:29:48,766
still producing this content

1080
01:29:49,144 --> 01:29:50,761
are not directly

1081
01:29:51,618 --> 01:29:52,118
creating

1082
01:29:52,457 --> 01:29:54,133
content that's like this.

1083
01:29:54,692 --> 01:29:56,564
That's the kind of world

1084
01:29:56,983 --> 01:30:09,039
that they've they've steep in. Right? And so hopefully, you move on and hopefully, you advance but at some point you have to, like, make a decision I think internally

1085
01:30:09,377 --> 01:30:12,644
right? To do better and to recognize

1086
01:30:13,024 --> 01:30:16,564
that some of the stuff you consumed in your childhood

1087
01:30:17,224 --> 01:30:17,724
was

1088
01:30:18,104 --> 01:30:25,179
rotten. Right? It had a rotten and core. And and this story, i I will acknowledge that I think it has some good artist,

1089
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:27,699
some great illustration

1090
01:30:28,134 --> 01:30:29,154
some great dialogue,

1091
01:30:29,534 --> 01:30:31,074
and some clever storytelling,

1092
01:30:31,454 --> 01:30:35,034
but it is rotten at its core. Right? It it's

1093
01:30:35,414 --> 01:30:35,894
foundation.

1094
01:30:36,308 --> 01:30:44,141
Is built on a culture that that had these very that that had these diaz. And and I think this is

1095
01:30:44,694 --> 01:30:45,194
rat

1096
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:46,774
way to, like,

1097
01:30:47,734 --> 01:31:01,212
understand what the culture was like at this time. Right? This is a kids story. So that that would be my answer. Right? The stories that the stories that you and I are reading and watching today are generally better. And they're generally more mindful,

1098
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:11,859
but they're made by content creators that may have grown up with stuff like this. Does that make sense? Mh. So that... That's my thought. Are your kids into, like, Stephen

1099
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:13,379
universe and Shi

1100
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:17,194
and all of those that have been hailed as just

1101
01:31:18,212 --> 01:31:18,712
fantastically

1102
01:31:19,171 --> 01:31:19,671
progressive.

1103
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:20,590
Yeah.

1104
01:31:21,248 --> 01:31:27,913
You know, especially my oldest, my oldest is very like, socially conscious and very

1105
01:31:28,291 --> 01:31:28,791
actively

1106
01:31:29,329 --> 01:31:30,548
geared towards

1107
01:31:30,886 --> 01:31:40,553
equality, leaving the world better. Right? And and that's something that is coming easier to the next generation. I think. That's something where, like, I have to actively

1108
01:31:41,093 --> 01:31:47,882
try to open my mind to it. But that's the kind of media that that he wants to consume my oldest.

1109
01:31:48,261 --> 01:31:55,953
And my middle really enjoys it too. Like, similar stories. But I don't think is quite as like naturally in inclined to them.

1110
01:31:56,753 --> 01:31:59,614
You know, I I enjoy I've read stories

1111
01:32:00,327 --> 01:32:07,490
to both of those kids. Haven't read this one to either of them. It would be so much work try to

1112
01:32:08,042 --> 01:32:21,414
realize this one. And I've read some of them that do have some some of the challenging content because I'm always happy to contextualize that. I think it's a great opportunity. This one is just it is too much

1113
01:32:21,753 --> 01:32:29,971
work. You could teach a college class on this. Story. Mh. Oh, yeah. When I was doing the the reading for

1114
01:32:30,308 --> 01:32:35,395
who do was versus what Voodoo was, it it that it was just

1115
01:32:35,707 --> 01:32:45,361
so much just just for the context for the title. Right. As I've kind of said with every episode you've invited me to be on. It's a fascinating

1116
01:32:45,818 --> 01:32:46,318
ant

1117
01:32:47,054 --> 01:32:50,762
study of what was going on in that time period.

1118
01:32:51,281 --> 01:32:56,028
Yeah. Because I think the things that we expect kids to consume

1119
01:32:56,488 --> 01:33:02,628
And and Barks didn't talk down the way a lot of creators did. But it's a a really interesting

1120
01:33:03,128 --> 01:33:03,628
reflection

1121
01:33:04,102 --> 01:33:09,997
on society. And this there's just so much about the history and the legacy of colonialism

1122
01:33:10,416 --> 01:33:11,156
and racism

1123
01:33:11,974 --> 01:33:13,407
in this one that

1124
01:33:13,787 --> 01:33:17,403
I think it's it's well worth reading because it's it's fascinating.

1125
01:33:18,062 --> 01:33:21,319
But... The rubber stuff that we didn't even have time to go into.

1126
01:33:21,832 --> 01:33:22,770
I know I've...

1127
01:33:23,345 --> 01:33:25,280
Anyway, I mean we're gonna talk about...

1128
01:33:25,895 --> 01:33:34,232
We gotta go into that general consensus. Right? Like, I told you at the outset, this one is still pretty well regarded. If you check on in du,

1129
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:37,843
this one gets a seven point nine out of ten

1130
01:33:38,221 --> 01:33:45,375
which as of today is good for number forty nine out of all, you know, forty roughly forty one thousand

1131
01:33:45,807 --> 01:33:46,905
Disney comments.

1132
01:33:47,242 --> 01:33:55,378
And and if you just pulled out all of the non Barks stories, I didn't count them, but I'm guessing that would place it in, like, the the low twenty.

1133
01:33:56,390 --> 01:34:03,514
Right? Like so this is in the upper tier as far as the opinion of fans. That's it's very highly

1134
01:34:04,067 --> 01:34:06,407
rated. I've I've talked extensively

1135
01:34:06,747 --> 01:34:10,127
already about my feelings. There's some fascinating

1136
01:34:10,467 --> 01:34:10,967
storytelling

1137
01:34:11,801 --> 01:34:18,717
there's some truly great dialogue in this one. There's a lot of art it's par Barks. So there's some really

1138
01:34:19,054 --> 01:34:19,554
great

1139
01:34:20,026 --> 01:34:22,240
drawings in this one. But ultimately,

1140
01:34:22,776 --> 01:34:23,573
it it's...

1141
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:26,364
This well is just too poisoned.

1142
01:34:26,762 --> 01:34:34,266
Right? For for me, to do anything but read it with this... The the yikes Yeah doctor. Right? And

1143
01:34:34,725 --> 01:34:36,904
possible to read it without a dis

1144
01:34:37,322 --> 01:34:37,717
voice

1145
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:39,989
yelling yikes every

1146
01:34:40,366 --> 01:34:41,760
every few panels.

1147
01:34:43,075 --> 01:34:51,996
There there is a lit graph and oil painting. He did do an oil painting version of this one that that represents the cover. It's a pretty cool painting. And

1148
01:34:52,627 --> 01:34:57,476
do like to mention if Ducktales ever adapted if what do you think? I feel like it's

1149
01:34:57,815 --> 01:35:01,029
very cinematic. And and full of adventure

1150
01:35:01,501 --> 01:35:02,839
I would guess, yes.

1151
01:35:03,177 --> 01:35:08,744
Right. They never did. The very first series run, the original one. And when I

1152
01:35:09,257 --> 01:35:18,492
started watching the second one. I got a little bit behind and, you know, Eric hart who's one of the other hosts. He and I were talking at one point about

1153
01:35:18,911 --> 01:35:20,148
the new Ducktales.

1154
01:35:20,188 --> 01:35:36,430
And he said, you know what, In season two, will you told me? They do a take on Bomb zombie. Not voodoo. Okay. Right. Okay. And I I told him, I I couldn't believe. Eric said, no, you know what, They actually handled it pretty well. And I was super skeptical.

1155
01:35:36,809 --> 01:35:40,185
But they they did. What they did is they actually

1156
01:35:40,884 --> 01:35:42,063
completely removed

1157
01:35:42,535 --> 01:35:46,941
the voodoo element of this and the curse they they left in,

1158
01:35:47,318 --> 01:35:50,169
they essentially re con into a mysterious

1159
01:35:50,601 --> 01:35:58,319
curse where the richest person in the world at any given time is followed by this force

1160
01:35:58,696 --> 01:36:00,052
called the bomb.

1161
01:36:00,426 --> 01:36:01,764
And it's not a zombie.

1162
01:36:02,502 --> 01:36:04,079
It's just this kind of monstrous

1163
01:36:04,816 --> 01:36:08,908
force. And I don't know that they needed to have even bothered

1164
01:36:09,421 --> 01:36:20,027
I think it's adaptable. Right. But that is how they chose to do it. And and absent the fact that it was called the Bomb, it really had nothing to do with this story.

1165
01:36:20,327 --> 01:36:27,602
So, you know, that's alright. I don't know that there was Al really a need to preserve the name Bam, but they took on the challenge

1166
01:36:28,341 --> 01:36:45,247
any any panels that you are willing to admit Al being a favorite panel or one that you liked? I guess when you say panel, I think about artists street. So it's mostly the artist street, but it can also be about the storytelling or really whatever kind strikes your fancy.

1167
01:36:46,241 --> 01:36:48,978
You know, I feel like the Karen ladies.

1168
01:36:50,435 --> 01:36:53,272
They're hilarious to me. Yeah. French.

1169
01:36:54,164 --> 01:36:56,635
Gossip ladies just contextual julie.

1170
01:36:57,233 --> 01:37:00,245
Yeah. And and it's got some very notable character

1171
01:37:00,701 --> 01:37:07,812
design. I really like the panel where Donald wakes up with the Bam at the foot of the bed and is just screeching.

1172
01:37:08,152 --> 01:37:12,866
That was cool. And then I liked the one where the citizens are running in fear. Mh.

1173
01:37:13,487 --> 01:37:21,558
We've had a ton to say about this one. You know, I thought that I thought that one of my favorite stories is the one we did last

1174
01:37:22,017 --> 01:37:26,726
episode lost in the Andes, and I just indulged myself and talked

1175
01:37:27,226 --> 01:37:40,487
at length about it. And I thought that would be our longest steps episode, but this one is on track to be our longest, and I I don't know. We've had some really great conversations I don't know that I wanna edit too much of it out. Any any closing thoughts sarah?

1176
01:37:41,385 --> 01:37:41,885
Nope.

1177
01:37:42,344 --> 01:37:46,177
So if if any listeners wanna wanna yell at me for,

1178
01:37:46,516 --> 01:37:46,717
you know,

1179
01:37:47,476 --> 01:37:52,296
be smart the the good name of Voodoo Hut if this is your favorite.

1180
01:37:53,116 --> 01:37:54,936
You might wanna look in the mirror, but

1181
01:37:55,690 --> 01:37:56,709

If if I haven't upset you too much, hopefully, you will stick around for next episode.

1186
01:38:10,086 --> 01:38:12,841
I'm gonna have a lot of fun talking about a much

1187
01:38:13,301 --> 01:38:15,479
light more light lighthearted story,

1188
01:38:15,818 --> 01:38:17,197
letter to santa,

1189
01:38:17,656 --> 01:38:25,206
and I I managed to talk my my own wife and joining me for that one. So I am so excited

1190
01:38:25,706 --> 01:38:28,266
to bring Sue into the conversation.

1191
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:30,618
Thank you very much.

1192
01:38:31,237 --> 01:38:36,132
Sarah. Thank you for having me. I always appreciate our conversations.

1193
01:38:36,725 --> 01:38:37,225
Excellent.

1194
01:38:37,725 --> 01:38:38,906
That's it. Perfect.
