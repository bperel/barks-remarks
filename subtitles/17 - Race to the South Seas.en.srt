00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:55,241
Hello again, and welcome back to Barks remarks, the podcast where we talk about Carl Barks Stories.

3
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:59,083
I am Mark Sever marino, Al longtime comic fan.

4
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:06,897
And I'm gonna ask my guests to introduce herself and tell me the last time she was on a boat

5
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:09,822
I'm Sarah Santiago

6
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:13,868
and the last time I was in a boat was about a month ago.

7
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:15,724
We have this

8
00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:18,492
this paddle steam,

9
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:31,191
which is quite rare for Scotland. Right? There's something that you normally consider like, a mississippi delta kind of boat. And there was one that's been in Glasgow for a long time. It was recently

10
00:01:31,608 --> 00:02:02,800
restored and now it makes little day trips out to like, the isle of butte and back to glass. So it i have to go do one of those. It was really neat. Does sound neat. That sounds like some peaceful fun. It sounds more relaxing than the kind of long ocean voyage that the ducks are gonna take because we're gonna be talking about race to the south seas today. So this is a story where Donald and the boys are gonna be in a race against their cousin Gladstone

11
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:22,920
to see who can be the first to locate their missing uncle sc Du. So we've kinda got the dynamics of the Ducktales family taking shape, you know, Glad gander and sc duck are both very new characters at this point. Both characters that were created by Carl Barks

12
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:28,988
you got to you got to read the first couple of sc stories,

13
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:33,437
but you haven't... This is your first experience with Glad

14
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:34,354
Gander.

15
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,440
This is my first experience with Gladstone. Yes.

16
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,094
Yeah. I'll have to share with you his

17
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:41,931
original

18
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:43,105
appearance.

19
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:56,913
He is not in too many of these adventure length ones. I I can think of probably about half dozen of them. But I think this is roughly his third or fourth appearance. It's just the first time he's been in one of these long ones.

20
00:02:57,531 --> 00:03:01,405
This is one of the very first ones, though where he's had his very characteristic

21
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:03,245
luck.

22
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:06,205
So to me, he's a really interesting

23
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:13,220
carrot who makes for some very entertaining stories. Can I ask Sarah, what is your impression of Glad gander?

24
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,295
I mean, he's His his luck is annoying. I have on my notes.

25
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:21,655
Wow, Gladstone

26
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,115
look is really annoying. Mh.

27
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:26,206
Yeah. And I can see how

28
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:28,321
how it can

29
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:34,760
look to Donald whose luck is typically bad. But I also feel like

30
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:36,594
glad stone is

31
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:40,022
the beneficiary of of so much privilege

32
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:48,383
that he was cultured and nurtured and raised in in these ways where Donald wasn't.

33
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:51,220
And so he knows how to cultivate

34
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:52,554
relationships

35
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,705
where Donald, I think only has

36
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:01,256
friends because his nephews have no choice. Right? Donald not really

37
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:02,548
pleasant

38
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,143
in a lot of ways. Whereas,

39
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:13,678
I specifically wrote down. I'm pretty sure that Gladstone has read how to win friends and influence people. Almost certainly,

40
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:21,860
if it if it existed, I don't know when that was published. It did. It was was first published in the thirties. So it it had been

41
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,300
widely

42
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,980
read by that point...

43
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,960
I'm not sure though that he would, because that sounds too much like work.

44
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:33,995
I mean what's stone above all is a professional idol.

45
00:04:34,495 --> 00:04:37,235
That's fair. I... Maybe his

46
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:39,968
father had read it and

47
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:40,887
instilled

48
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:59,990
some of that kind of passively and so he's absorbed some of it by osmosis If he hadn't read it. So... I mean, you're going off your your first impressions. Right? I've read dozens of stories with them. So I think I think you're totally on base. Right? Because he he really is like that dis.

49
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,010
The... He is the essence of privilege.

50
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:05,201
Because he gets everything

51
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:17,494
that he wants. It just comes to him without having... You know he he's playing on easy mode. Right? And he's always meant to be a contrast with Donald. You know,

52
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:31,909
sc, of course is gonna get to appear in his own stories very soon. Gladstone never appears in like stories by himself. He's always a foil for Donald. And I think it's interesting because you can tell that Barks

53
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:34,127
himself hates glad.

54
00:05:34,546 --> 00:05:39,560
Right? Like, he is... I think he's amusing and his luck creates for some really

55
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:40,972
interesting

56
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,481
situations and scenarios, but Barks does not like him. Barks

57
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:54,470
is almost to a false he is about that sort of idea of the self reliant man who pulls himself up by his own bootstrap.

58
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:58,261
And so Glad is kind of meant to

59
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,260
embody

60
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,390
those who are not willing to work and just wait for

61
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,790
you know, good things to come to them. Yeah. I had

62
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,470
I had wondered

63
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,758
what is this guy? What does this supposed to mean? What is this supposed to represent

64
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:16,790
these... I find these

65
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,578
comics to be Al interesting

66
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:22,944
anthropology lesson right on

67
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:27,773
on this era of American history and and cultural

68
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:28,611
ideas

69
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:30,105
And obviously,

70
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:41,073
America... The rugged individual has been kind of pervasive since the beginning and it takes us on different shapes and different flavors with different generations. And

71
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:44,544
I I just wondered it just felt weird

72
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:45,501
that

73
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:47,312
Here was this character

74
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:53,310
that failed up in such a in such a way that it was

75
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,110
not celebrated.

76
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,550
Right? Because we we have people in our culture, you know, now that sail

77
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:08,266
and they have, you know, a whole half of the United States that want to see them fail upward even more. Yeah. And and

78
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,480
So I could see that there was a commentary

79
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,560
on

80
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:19,210
hard work and kind of the p work ethic. But it was it was a confusing mesh message

81
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,208
because

82
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:21,525
we see

83
00:07:22,063 --> 00:07:25,317
success on in the hands of this lazy character

84
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:26,689
and

85
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:27,526
failure

86
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:34,065
on on Donald, Who's our protagonist and who is working hard. He's just not necessarily

87
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:35,102
working

88
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:36,472
smartly.

89
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:52,512
Right. And I think you really have to read it as being all about Donald. Right? None of the commentary is specifically about glad. He really only works as a foil. I think you're right on about, you know, the the p and work ethic

90
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,045
that's very much in character

91
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:55,865
for Barks.

92
00:07:57,505 --> 00:07:59,265
Stalling the virtue of hard work.

93
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:02,045
And and a lot of these stories

94
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,200
are gonna end like this, the stories that feature glad stone where even though he is lucky,

95
00:08:10,092 --> 00:08:19,145
Donald will still come out on top in some of them. But but again, because this is Barks and he's not consistent, there are gonna be times where Glad does come out ahead.

96
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,449
So, I mean, as far as high concepts,

97
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:23,923
glad s

98
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:33,165
supernatural luck is something that a lot of comic book writers are gonna have a lot of fun. It's a it's a really interesting character feature.

99
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:41,014
So I'm I'm excited that he has kinda joined the fray. Well, we'll get to do a few more of these. I found it interesting

100
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:41,893
that

101
00:08:42,632 --> 00:08:45,984
it it wasn't just luck that

102
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:48,259
he represented, but

103
00:08:48,597 --> 00:08:49,097
wealth

104
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:53,887
because I look at at now, right, where where wealth is v.

105
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,260
And... Oh, you know, if you're if you're rich, you can get away with anything. If you're rich, you can

106
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,220
buy your way out of any situation

107
00:09:03,814 --> 00:09:04,314
And

108
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:08,869
we we really elevate people who are wealthy

109
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:15,989
in our culture. And so it was interesting to see there was a time when that wealth

110
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:17,822
without hard work

111
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,145
was... It was very clear that Barks was taking a stand against

112
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:27,505
wealth without work. Whereas in our culture now, we have

113
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:32,358
people famous just for being famous and and that's just kind of the opposite.

114
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:41,203
Yeah. Keep... Keep that in mind going forward. Right? Because that's gonna become just a huge part of the underpinning. So ami subs

115
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:50,600
deck and so forth. So let's let's get into the comic itself. This is our oh, I think this might be the last one that appeared in

116
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:55,346
March of comments, the one of the giveaway comics, number forty one.

117
00:09:55,723 --> 00:10:05,728
I think I said that this didn't. This is published in nineteen forty nine because it was one of the march of comic stories. I don't have the exact publishing dates. This has been reprinted

118
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:13,420
seven times including the original and it's again a fairly shorter one like the last episode. This one only twenty two pages.

119
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:14,574
And

120
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:21,660
there's some moderately interesting background trivia. So some parts of this story were

121
00:10:22,158 --> 00:10:26,842
lost for a long time or at least the original art that was easier to reprint.

122
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:29,392
So when it was reprinted in

123
00:10:30,382 --> 00:10:31,122
In the Netherlands,

124
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:32,837
one of the local artists

125
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,430
redid many of the panels

126
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:36,467
and

127
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:42,666
So the reprint over the years have been kind of a mash of Barks and

128
00:10:43,124 --> 00:10:43,624
either

129
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:44,542
Don

130
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:57,714
or dick v, I think is his name. And and some of the re reprint they've kinda left some of the Dutch writing in intact. I think you can see it in the one that we're re reprint or the re reprint that we're

131
00:10:58,213 --> 00:11:10,220
that we've read where in the on the second page. I'll point it out. It has the Dutch name for uncle Sc, which is Dogg barrett on the document that the lawyer has. And then

132
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,340
the that lawyer that I mentioned, his name is Sylvester Sc,

133
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,060
and that's kind of a random

134
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:23,855
maybe an accidental reference, maybe a deliberate reference to a character from the old Mickey mouse comic strip from a decade earlier.

135
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,626
That floyd Gottfredson

136
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:30,455
created. He was a pretty notable villain that worked with them with Peg leg Pete.

137
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:36,352
I mentioned that this is the first full length or adventure length story that Glad Gander

138
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:39,756
has appeared in. He was recently introduced in one of Barks

139
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:51,653
best ten pager in my opinion called wintertime Wage, but he didn't have his luck at that point. And this is, I think the fourth appearance by now of uncle sc,

140
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:57,065
and this is gonna to be the first time he appears with his top hat. So that's a excellent.

141
00:11:57,996 --> 00:12:01,502
What what was the name of the character? Was it also sylvester shi?

142
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:06,721
It was. The the same name, so sylvester s and and it could have been coincidence

143
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:11,390
because, you know, it's very common to call boy characters sc

144
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:12,806
and, you know,

145
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:14,759
sylvester

146
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:24,402
with that nicely. But I i I assume that Barks read those those mickey mouse he was so involved with the company. And they were very popular.

147
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:34,903
I did think that the name... I did think that the name Shy was interesting. I remember my and father, you know, anybody that he thought was crooked. He called it shi.

148
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:41,037
So I I found it interesting that His name was Sc spelled s h y s t e r.

149
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:51,139
Because I thought that that kind of word which my grandfather always used you know, and and as some, you know, to describe something crooked was

150
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,070
a reference to the German word that is, you know, a swear word. And here I find it that it's it's

151
00:12:58,927 --> 00:12:59,427
completely

152
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:09,536
different spelling. So I've I've always wondered where do you know the the origin of that word? I I think it... I think it's origin is exactly what you just said actually.

153
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:13,185
I think okay. Is an an s head is

154
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:17,825
kind of where it comes from. K? I I did I did see some people

155
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:18,520
suggest

156
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,620
some people have the impression that it's anti semitic,

157
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,015
because I think it sounds like Shy lock, right, which is

158
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:28,932
Al slur that people use against lawyers

159
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,168
to typically Jewish lawyers and comes from

160
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:34,380
Ot fellow. Right? But

161
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:37,116
or oh, no merchant events. I'm sorry.

162
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:41,910
But a different different word. Right? S stir versus Shy.

163
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:54,352
But but... yeah, it's it's... I've heard that too, and I think people from that era used use Chi a lot in a way that they don't really anymore Yeah. So i mean, let me say a couple of the titles from around the world.

164
00:13:55,089 --> 00:14:01,115
This was... I like this one because it had a publication in Indonesia. I haven't gotten to do that before.

165
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:04,595
The direct translation was Lo K

166
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:05,395
Ce

167
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,135
race to the South seas.

168
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:13,003
That was the most south sea adjacent country I could find that it was published in. And

169
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:19,442
let's see and Spain, it was Colorado and los modest and sur and

170
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:20,479
in

171
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:23,270
Greece, it was translated as

172
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:25,559
confrontation in the south pacific.

173
00:14:26,138 --> 00:14:27,717
Anna a med three c.

174
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:31,913
I'm sure that was

175
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:34,310
not even clubs. But anyway, I

176
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:42,021
Alright. A little bit of geographical context, of course, the south seas is the term for the southern

177
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:43,257
Pacific ocean.

178
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:45,384
What we would call Ocean,

179
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:49,050
which I don't know if that's even used that much.

180
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:50,763
It's not Ocean.

181
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:56,842
i've I I may be pronouncing wrong. And then and then I know that culturally,

182
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:04,195
it is true that many of the islands of the South Pacific were known to have kind of a tradition of

183
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:06,269
hospitality and gift giving

184
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:15,600
in the way that Gladstone is gonna take advantage of in this story. I don't I don't think it's quite as not as characterized in this, but I think that is

185
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:17,518
somewhat a part of

186
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:26,562
culture, some parts. And and you know, we get kind of the trope of of cannibal outages at the end of this one.

187
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,599
It's not like a

188
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:30,916
huge part of the story fortunately,

189
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:31,490
but

190
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:50,350
you know, it's a it's a tough thing to talk about these days because it's like such a taboo, but I do think it is worth kind of commenting that, you know, cannibalism is one of those things that's been practiced by societies all around the world in varying forms

191
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,190
it

192
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,550
was practiced in fiji

193
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,990
and in neighboring areas,

194
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,483
but it had basically

195
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,874
gone away as of like the eighteen sixties.

196
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:08,357
So this is something that you know, appears in adventure stories well into the sixties,

197
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,954
but that's not really

198
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:13,870
reflective of modern poly.

199
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:15,165
At all.

200
00:16:15,585 --> 00:16:21,505
I think it's... It's largely disappeared even by then except in some very remote areas.

201
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:23,365
Alright. Any comments

202
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:29,967
before we get into the plot of the story itself. Nope. Awesome. Oh, you know,

203
00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:34,655
what do you think is our version of Donald here? Any thoughts on that?

204
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:38,775
I I I feel like he's gone back to his

205
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,270
ruled by big, disorganized emotions

206
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,670
and the kids end up having to

207
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:57,099
and problem solve, which is based on the comics that I've read so far, that's very typical for you. Yeah. I think that's exactly right. Awesome.

208
00:16:58,034 --> 00:16:58,534
So

209
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:02,060
oh and of course, our notable appearance is Gladstone

210
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:02,799
Gander.

211
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,931
And we'll see a lot more of him.

212
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:16,432
So this story opens with Donald and his cousin glad stone fishing and having an argument over whose side of the family is better. You know, the way family members do.

213
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:19,300
Donald brag about the great workers

214
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:21,150
that there are on his side.

215
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:23,560
Especially as rich uncle Scrooge,

216
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:35,299
while glad stone brag about how the gander never had work. And they get to arguing over who Scrooge just favor relative and by extension, who is going to inherit his wealth?

217
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,475
And eventually a lawyer encounters the Ducktales and reveals that mister Mc has given Gladstone a wonderful

218
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:43,315
present.

219
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:46,089
Alright. So on the next page.

220
00:17:46,666 --> 00:18:04,870
The cousins are shocked to learn that the gift is a sailboat boat anchored nearby. The man introduces himself as Lawyer, and he reads the very sarcastic letter of gift getting. Donald is disgusted by what glad tones getting, but then he stops when he realizes the lawyer has good news for him as well.

221
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,110
I thought that was pretty funny. Whereas

222
00:18:07,624 --> 00:18:19,038
The gander is so full of when he can sail boat on a still day. I am presenting him this twenty foot sale craft. I liked that. That was pretty funny. And so he reads a similarly

223
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:20,912
sarcastic message

224
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:24,160
that gifts her boat to Donald as well.

225
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:31,275
And both cousins now are very sm and they evolved deeper into argument over who is Ru favorite.

226
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:32,749
And the nephews

227
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:38,103
resolve that they're gonna have their uncle settle the question. Does it feel like

228
00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:39,062
Donald

229
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:44,294
sailboat gift is not as nice as glad stones.

230
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:45,554
Yeah.

231
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:46,174
I mean,

232
00:18:47,014 --> 00:18:58,160
the the gander one, I don't know. I can't I can't really tell sailboat apart. But i I do think it's interesting that Donald doesn't seem to react to sc just like insults.

233
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:03,742
There. He's just standing there so proud. Any attention is good attention sometimes.

234
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:12,840
Yeah. And this is pretty common this this, like, these don and glad stories, they often open with this kind of arguing this kind of bi.

235
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:20,325
So on the next page, the Nephews arrive at Sc his office and learned that he has recently flown to Australia.

236
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:26,034
To count his billion his eight billion sheep. He's not gonna be back till tomorrow

237
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:27,073
and

238
00:19:27,812 --> 00:19:28,312
d

239
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:32,665
the head back and encounter a headline from a newspaper boy.

240
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:38,665
They share the news with Donald when they get back that sc is missing. He is feared,

241
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,940
cast away on some lonely island.

242
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,420
I thought it was interesting that he was gonna make a

243
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,315
round trip to Australia in

244
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:49,515
one

245
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:50,555
day.

246
00:19:51,295 --> 00:20:05,795
Yeah. If they been paying attention, maybe they have realized his story didn't didn't hold up. So glad muscles in on Don news reading and they both learned that small boats are needed to comb the remote lagoon and shallow

247
00:20:06,694 --> 00:20:12,007
glad gets the idea that sc is going to be mighty grateful to whoever rescues him.

248
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:13,226
And

249
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:18,471
the two cousins go to each other into a race to be that rescue.

250
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:19,868
The nephews

251
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:24,673
sen separate to go get provisions to together for the voyage.

252
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:30,260
Yeah. They're the ones, of course who have to do all the problems solving, getting maps and

253
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:31,756
supplies and such.

254
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,070
Right. It's easy to picture Dom glad

255
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:35,990
arguing

256
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:41,843
for hours yeah. And so on the next page, we see the docs very thoroughly and sen

257
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:43,441
preparing for the voyage.

258
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,415
Gladstone is just talking big and sailing around the bay.

259
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:55,844
Donald cancels the Nephews that they need to call him sir on the voyage. And the nephews think they're gonna have the vantage

260
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:59,772
because of Gladstone behavior. But Donald reminds him about their...

261
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,205
Gladstone is born lucky.

262
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:06,346
And that night, they get awakened buy a commotion at the docks.

263
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:09,812
And that commotion turns out to be a bunch of people

264
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:10,944
loading

265
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:11,902
supplies

266
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:20,139
well wish that are provisioning glad boat for him. So his boast full talk has gotten everyone attention,

267
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:27,830
and he gets provisioned for free and at no effort to himself, leaving Donald to silk.

268
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:32,769
And I don't know about you, Sarah, but this this does feel fairly timely

269
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,283
this kind of

270
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,838
attention seeking

271
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:42,150
Yeah. I mean, given the... What we know today about how to court the media,

272
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:47,505
right? That this is where I wrote. I bet glad stone has read how to win friends and influence people.

273
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,540
Because

274
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:49,934
he is cultivating

275
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:51,129
relationships,

276
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,260
so he's not not working in this case. He's just cultivating relationships.

277
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,620
And

278
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:00,913
winning people's,

279
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:01,832
affection

280
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:15,854
and well wishes and kind of exploiting them, definitely exploiting them to get all of this provisioning and preparation done, You know, all he has to do is butter people up. Yeah. And And

281
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:22,600
to me, this this feels very realistic. Right? Like lots of his luck is supernatural and very fan, but

282
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,799
This is easy to picture.

283
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,280
You know, people like to be involved

284
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:42,885
and they like this kind of big talk sometimes. So this kinda trying hit a little realistic to me. Alright. And on the next page, at daybreak break, the docs set sail while Glad tone sleeps in and Donald

285
00:22:43,264 --> 00:22:46,300
immediately proves that he is not up to the challenge of sailing.

286
00:22:46,754 --> 00:22:51,439
He's piloting the boat very radically by while he's spout nonsensical

287
00:22:52,413 --> 00:23:03,865
maritime lingo that doesn't mean anything. And this this really feels like Donald is kind of coast on his own... He's he's very much assuming that this is just gonna work out Oh, yeah.

288
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:05,605
Donald is

289
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,045
completely oblivious

290
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:09,405
to what he doesn't know. He's...

291
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:14,176
Well if if Gladstone is the embody of luck and privilege.

292
00:23:14,513 --> 00:23:15,651
Donald is the

293
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:22,644
embodiment of Dun Scrooge. Yes. He's he's very over confident, but he's at least gonna be able to reach calibrate.

294
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:35,550
Yeah. And he has the kids to with that. That that is his his true strength. So Donald, on the next page, he keeps running his mouth and con comp himself and eventually runs them ground on a sand.

295
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:52,733
As he despair Gladstone getting an early lead, the Nephews rum something from beneath the charts in the hold, which is revealed to be an instructional book called how to sail about. And I really like this gag. I thought this was great. Kids to the rescue as always.

296
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:59,966
Yeah. So the ducks are able to set sail and get underway. And eventually, they come across Glad,

297
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:04,970
who has fur his sales to stop and fish.

298
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:12,425
And he brag that he could fish for a week and still beat them. And he's basically proven a riot when he hooks a huge

299
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:14,343
sail or Marlin,

300
00:24:14,802 --> 00:24:25,139
traveling west by Southwest at fifty knots exactly where he needs to go. Yeah. That's some luck. Yeah. More of a supernatural variety. Yeah. I'm sure that

301
00:24:26,155 --> 00:24:27,293
making the Marlin

302
00:24:27,631 --> 00:24:32,773
feel you know, warmth and love and and and seen is not the

303
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,127
strategy he used from

304
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,260
for this one. Right.

305
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:58,231
And then on the next page, Donald luck proves as bad as Gladstone is good. As the typhoon forms around them. The Ducktales take shelter and they hear the storm smashed their mask and red and steering post. And Donald despair that they've basically lost the race. But the boys point out that Gladstone is nearby and he's getting just as bummed up.

306
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:14,875
And when the storm passes the Ducktales get to work and they use ore to paddle, they caution Gladstone that he needs to get rowing. But he explains that he'll just wait for a lift rather than resort to manual labor. And sure enough, we got a pretty cool scene of a whale

307
00:25:15,612 --> 00:25:16,112
emerging

308
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:26,626
underneath his boat and carrying him towards ta tahiti. As as you do, you know, Yep. That's that's what he counts on. And so Donald is Al

309
00:25:27,344 --> 00:25:44,254
from anger, but he does quickly come to his senses and he tells the nephew that they need to ration their supplies carefully as they are fifteen hundred miles to the nearest island. So the Ducktales we row onward for days and days and they get to listen to radio news about glad,

310
00:25:44,831 --> 00:25:47,965
breaking all records for fast ocean crossings.

311
00:25:48,502 --> 00:25:55,040
They learned that he has arrived at one of the islands and he's basking in the sun, while helpful Islanders

312
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:56,375
repair his boat.

313
00:25:56,908 --> 00:26:00,117
And I guess, is the fun gag where Donald gets

314
00:26:00,812 --> 00:26:03,715
upset with the radio news and throws the

315
00:26:04,454 --> 00:26:09,967
the radio in the ocean as the four cats come on singing how deep is the ocean?

316
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:16,039
And eventually the Ducktales land on what they identify as Coca ebola Island

317
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:22,889
where Gladstone landed long ago. But we learned that Glad is still there. He's just been living off the natives

318
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:28,719
generosity and goodwill and and en them with his glut knee because they're

319
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:30,999
you know, their traditions basically

320
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:35,459
for treating guests appear not to let them say no.

321
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:41,273
The island's mayor approaches Glad to make the case that he should leave.

322
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:45,433
And and you know this to me, Sarah is pretty notable because

323
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:50,099
this depiction of the islanders is probably one of the more

324
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:52,824
it's one of the best depictions that

325
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:57,940
that Barks has made of a person from the global south

326
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:02,135
a group from the global south. I I wouldn't say it's like sensitive.

327
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:05,466
But, you know, they're not speaking and, like, pigeon speak

328
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:06,865
the way the cannibal

329
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:09,142
will and couple of pages.

330
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,261
They

331
00:27:11,134 --> 00:27:12,513
they're drawn relatively

332
00:27:12,972 --> 00:27:13,472
respectfully.

333
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,350
They have

334
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:19,305
what Barks seems to be depicting Al like a very

335
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:26,144
a more positive culture than then we'll often see some of these, like, very colonial

336
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,154
tropes. Represent.

337
00:27:28,573 --> 00:27:32,669
Yeah. And it's clear that he's exploiting them. Right? Where

338
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:35,866
he... He he obviously feels entitled

339
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:36,825
to

340
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:39,554
what these people have and

341
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:46,950
the message overall of this page is that he is exploiting them and overs staying his welcome

342
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:50,500
and putting them in a dangerous position. Absolutely.

343
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:56,301
And and on the next page. There's even more that you can read into it. You know, the mayor

344
00:27:56,719 --> 00:28:00,390
explains to him that they're almost out of food. They have nothing but coconut left.

345
00:28:01,003 --> 00:28:05,452
So glad stone decides to leave with everything left in their kitchens.

346
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,705
The natives celebrate his leaving,

347
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:15,190
and he's basically poisoned the well, right? Because they they resolved to stop being so generous.

348
00:28:16,281 --> 00:28:18,911
Right as the starving Ducktales

349
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:21,084
arrive. And I I read an essay

350
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:26,757
in one of my re reprint that you know, kind pos that this is Barks talking about

351
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:28,350
colonialism or

352
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:29,187
globalization

353
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:31,314
basically,

354
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:33,112
you know, ruining

355
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:37,048
some of these indigenous cultures. And it might have been a generous reading,

356
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:45,987
but but I think it's at least a legitimate way to to frame that. Right? Because that that you could argue that Glad stone

357
00:28:46,365 --> 00:28:48,794
is representative of that kind of

358
00:28:49,654 --> 00:28:50,674
exploit of colonialism.

359
00:28:51,174 --> 00:28:53,294
Yeah. And they are really smart to say,

360
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:57,354
okay. This is this ended badly for us. So

361
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:03,209
Yeah. We're not gonna do this again. I think the menace in that second to last panel

362
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:05,249
is kind of problematic.

363
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:06,449
Yeah.

364
00:29:07,283 --> 00:29:13,250
The the facial expression and the kind of threat of violence with him holding the club. But otherwise,

365
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:14,819
I mean, yeah, that

366
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:29,584
just... No. You don't deserve to be exploited, and you don't have to put up with it. Definitely. And and, you know, you're right. That's a very men thing look picture. But by by the next page when they get the chance to, you know, interact with the Ducktales they

367
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:31,038
basically,

368
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:37,373
they they still treat them as well as they need to. They just make them pay for everything.

369
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:43,985
And they may... Absolutely. Very well. And so it puts them on a more, I guess even footing with them. Yeah.

370
00:29:44,703 --> 00:29:45,203
And

371
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,803
on that page, we also get to see the archipelago of

372
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:50,839
y

373
00:29:51,892 --> 00:30:29,174
which is very lovingly drawn and and I think that that's probably parody a real place name, although I don't. I don't know which. But it's a cool panel of the Ducktales arrival. And Donald is just looking around with a spy to see if he can spot sc anywhere. And then on the next page, the Ducktales are stopped by an imp reef that protects all the best islands in the lagoon. And suddenly Gladstone shows up and his luck delivers him a tidal wave that lifts him gently over the reef. And this one, I found reminiscent of an earlier story that I don't think you got to read where the ducks

374
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:30,294
are

375
00:30:31,114 --> 00:30:35,954
trying to get access to a a lagoon in the ghost of the g. Very fun.

376
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:44,100
Share that with you. And so the Ducktales decide that, you know, if they wanna keep up with Glad, they're gonna have to blast their way through with dynamite.

377
00:30:44,613 --> 00:30:46,947
And they do and are back in the race.

378
00:30:47,324 --> 00:30:53,185
And soon Donald is scanning the islands with his spy Gladstone, and he suddenly spies uncle Scrooge.

379
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:57,132
Who is sitting calmly under a tree sipping with Coconut

380
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:00,844
and so the that's fell sure. And as soon as they dis,

381
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:08,680
They are greeted by a throne spear and they are shocked to see what they believe to be cannibal.

382
00:31:09,377 --> 00:31:18,792
Donald starts to stem about being only there to rescue you his uncle, but the Nephews wisely told him to shut up and run when they make it back to the boat, the Nephew point out that

383
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:19,604
those

384
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:20,563
inhabitants

385
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:30,542
might not know about uncle sp and they need to keep the element of surprise. So again, we've got the nephews, you know, really taking the lead here and and being

386
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:37,060
the clever ones. And so Donald at this point proposes to use glad luck to their advantage,

387
00:31:37,514 --> 00:31:38,174
He uses

388
00:31:38,554 --> 00:31:44,094
reverse psychology to convince glad to get on the island and intending to use him as a distraction.

389
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:50,583
Glad gets confronted by a similar spear and Donald tells him he'd better start on it. But

390
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,981
instead of chasing him, the islanders

391
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,672
point at glad

392
00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:06,495
spat, and they pros them themselves before him and bear him in a litter chair, like a king. I didn't know that term literature chair before reading this comic.

393
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:11,510
And the depths aren't are annoyed, but they see that at least the distraction has worked in a way.

394
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:16,304
And so they go ashore. And when they come across uncle sc,

395
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:22,029
they don't reveal themselves right away, but they see him basking with a mobile business office,

396
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:26,652
and they observe as sc talks calmly to one of those islanders.

397
00:32:27,164 --> 00:32:28,984
Who speaks in pigeon,

398
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:33,004
telling him about op fellow with white feet like Scrooge

399
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,684
spat. Any thoughts here on Scrooge

400
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:42,921
pretty luxurious island setup. I do wanna talk about it once he reveals what it is.

401
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:46,571
Sure. I did wanna comment on the spat. I

402
00:32:47,003 --> 00:32:54,044
looked up kind of when spat were popular, and it seems that they kind of went out of fashion

403
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:56,636
at least in the Us in

404
00:32:57,228 --> 00:33:01,737
quite a bit of time before these comments were made. And so... Right.

405
00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:04,810
Is sometime in the, like, nineteen thirties.

406
00:33:05,503 --> 00:33:08,556
So I've I've been finding it interesting that

407
00:33:08,973 --> 00:33:12,266
spat are used as a trope

408
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:17,708
to identify kind of wealthy people or attractive people. Like in

409
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,873
in the golden Christmas tree comic. Where

410
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,386
Donald wishes himself to be

411
00:33:24,763 --> 00:33:25,202
attractive.

412
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:37,619
Right. Yeah. It's an interesting sign fire. And and like you say they're so out of fashion that it doesn't really seem relevant at all these days, but it's just such a part of Sc character.

413
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:56,291
And yeah, as mentioned, this is know, our first time seeing that other fire of sc Al well his top hat. Oh he's got one of those old stock ticker next to them. Yeah. My my favorite little bits of of archaic, whatever. I love those things. I've never seen one in a real life. Alright. So

414
00:33:56,724 --> 00:34:00,973
a lot going on on the very last page. The docs

415
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:03,526
realize that the the so called cannibal

416
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,339
have been hired by sc. They're called his s,

417
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,859
and they watch

418
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:09,659
Glad

419
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:12,459
kind of bs s about his rescue

420
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:13,159
operation.

421
00:34:13,654 --> 00:34:17,107
He lies about Donald not caring enough to come to the rescue.

422
00:34:18,044 --> 00:34:25,664
He paints himself into the corner into a corner here because he's surprised to learn that sc doesn't want to be rescued.

423
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:26,981
He has

424
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:37,379
staged this whole plane crash so that he could get some work done without pest relatives around, and he's grateful to Donald for minding his business

425
00:34:37,757 --> 00:34:56,475
and tells Glad tone that he's gonna cut him out of his will and favor of Donald. And so the the story ends with the Ducks heading home with Donald, you know, donald that advantage and glad now su. And and, of course, this is all gonna be etch sketched away because there's gonna be other stories later about

426
00:34:56,789 --> 00:34:59,469
figuring out who sp real hair is.

427
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:00,449
But

428
00:35:00,749 --> 00:35:05,109
what were your your other thoughts about Scrooge setup and the conclusion?

429
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:08,840
So I I talk a lot in my real life and,

430
00:35:09,279 --> 00:35:16,669
especially about, like, fictional media that I consume that I wish people would just use their words. U.

431
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:29,501
It's a thing that we, you know, try to teach children is they're developing language and learning to understand their feelings, but I feel like there are so many adults that I wish would just use their words.

432
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:38,393
And, like, why can't sc just like set a healthy boundary. Just like, hey, guys, don't bother me. I need to be working.

433
00:35:38,952 --> 00:35:48,015
Instead he goes through this whole thing where he makes everybody think that he's lost sea or dead or a cast away on a lonely island

434
00:35:48,328 --> 00:35:49,627
he wastes navy

435
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:50,465
resources.

436
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:59,299
We don't know what the what the agreement is with him in the locals, but, like, is he exploiting them. Right. I don't know.

437
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:07,856
And and so that seems kind of like one of the worst defenses kind of more offensive than some of glad antique.

438
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:14,580
It's definitely the nuclear option. Right? Yeah. It's it's pretty over the top here. Yeah.

439
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:17,769
I did also wanna comment on how

440
00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:21,480
good the kids are as far as, like, being

441
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:23,435
being the more

442
00:36:24,188 --> 00:36:29,202
mature out of the most mature out of this whole group. Oh, daphne. They they obviously

443
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,494
don't like. Glad.

444
00:36:32,194 --> 00:36:33,134
But they don't

445
00:36:33,754 --> 00:36:35,054
participate in the rivalry

446
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:37,534
or the, like, fighting.

447
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:38,574
Right. The.

448
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:39,274
Yeah.

449
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:41,909
Yeah. So good for them.

450
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:43,109
So

451
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:49,921
what do you think about this story? What what what were your thoughts on it? Did you enjoy this one?

452
00:36:50,657 --> 00:36:51,954
You know, this one

453
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,628
made me

454
00:36:54,284 --> 00:36:56,817
uncomfortable. The narrative made me uncomfortable.

455
00:36:57,488 --> 00:36:59,980
And as well as the kind of

456
00:37:00,795 --> 00:37:04,841
exploitation of indigenous peoples made me uncomfortable and

457
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:06,411
The cliches

458
00:37:06,749 --> 00:37:09,203
about indigenous peoples made me uncomfortable.

459
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,080
But

460
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:14,547
I did also find it a really interesting study

461
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:22,621
of the values of the time. You know? Like I was saying to wealth without work was was not seen

462
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:23,434
as

463
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:24,434
the

464
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:25,634
esteem

465
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:26,954
societal

466
00:37:27,694 --> 00:37:29,194
thing that it is

467
00:37:29,574 --> 00:37:31,287
today. Yeah. We hadn't

468
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:36,793
moved away from that, like, v generation of work ethic. Maybe an over,

469
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,918
but at least, I feel like it was a consistent

470
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:44,408
value. I don't know. I don't I don't wanna sound like Al old Fur.

471
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,639
I started reading these when I was

472
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:58,368
seven or eight, and my my appreciation of them is definitely changed over time because like you I find this one very

473
00:37:58,707 --> 00:37:59,207
discomfort,

474
00:37:59,586 --> 00:38:00,086
discomfort.

475
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:04,255
Because you do have some of these old, like, colonial

476
00:38:05,153 --> 00:38:10,223
tropes, you know, this there are certain parts of this that feel very nineteenth century.

477
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:11,062
Mh.

478
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:16,735
And that is the case with a few of the, like, very first appearances

479
00:38:17,049 --> 00:38:18,205
of uncle Scrooge.

480
00:38:18,803 --> 00:38:25,282
I hope to have you back for a a deeply uncomfortable story that's coming up in just a couple

481
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:29,789
called Voodoo Who do. Oh, god. Which Okay.

482
00:38:30,389 --> 00:38:34,259
Is is the singular story that I've been dread the most

483
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:41,612
but but it is also an excellent piece of storytelling, and I don't wanna to dive too much into that right now, but

484
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:42,452
it

485
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:46,502
it was probably the first six to eight stories that featured

486
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:51,097
sc that didn't have him Al as the, like, modern capitalist

487
00:38:51,436 --> 00:38:56,380
that I think he became and still had some of these more nineteenth century

488
00:38:56,957 --> 00:38:58,153
like Robber Barks,

489
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,985
very colonial era,

490
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:02,620
money making tropes.

491
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:03,854
And

492
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:06,331
it is very uncomfortable.

493
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:11,105
It is entertaining. I'm I'm always entertained seeing Donald Gladstone.

494
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,279
Face off against each other. So I do like that aspect of it.

495
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:29,849
Glad tones luck and some of the slaps stick around that. I find that endlessly entertaining, so I do like that. That aspect of the story. I also... It was really creative. It the the ways that his look

496
00:39:30,507 --> 00:39:32,300
manifested. We're quite creative.

497
00:39:32,858 --> 00:39:34,514
Yeah. It's it's

498
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,441
definitely worth reading a few other Gladstone.

499
00:39:38,412 --> 00:39:42,700
Including some of the short ones that have some really fun stuff. And

500
00:39:43,436 --> 00:39:53,453
Donald rivalry with Gladstone is gonna end up being very multi facet, right? Because you probably won't be surprised to learn that he becomes rival

501
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,270
for Daisy affection with Oh goodness.

502
00:39:56,724 --> 00:39:57,224
So

503
00:39:57,761 --> 00:39:59,178
there are a lot of

504
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:03,545
Donald versus glad with Daisy as the prize story.

505
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,459
Course, because doesn't have grown agency does she.

506
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:11,593
Right. And and it's

507
00:40:12,224 --> 00:40:13,284
it's definitely

508
00:40:13,942 --> 00:40:15,501
interesting to read Barks

509
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:20,916
take on Daisy because he's not you... He's not very interested in female characters,

510
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:21,875
which

511
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:32,932
shows a lot. And he he kinda got stuck writing a lot of Daisy Ducktales stories for reasons that escaped me right now but he wrote, he wrote this series called Daisy Ducktales diary.

512
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:39,820
As far as, like a great example of men's idea of women's inner monologue

513
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,940
in the nineteen

514
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:49,595
is is a is a pretty great thing to read. But anyway, I'm I'm digress. I do like these Donald versus glad stories.

515
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:53,934
This one you know, this a this is a pretty enjoyable one.

516
00:40:54,589 --> 00:41:05,686
I consider it kind of a middle story as far as the ones that we've read. I was a little surprised to check it out on ducks and see that, you know, this is actually one that people...

517
00:41:06,303 --> 00:41:22,261
I guess it holds up very well for a lot of people because it's pretty highly rated. It has a seven point seven out of ten, which is good for one hundred and sixty four out of the forty one or so thousand stories that are rated. So like, not not the highest

518
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:24,311
tiered comic. But,

519
00:41:24,968 --> 00:41:28,581
you know, Barks wrote about five to six hundred stories

520
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:31,908
and so anything that's in the top two hundred

521
00:41:32,485 --> 00:41:43,892
is probably like, in the top twenty five percent, you know, his of his specific story. So people like this one. And I can see why it's it's got a nice mix of

522
00:41:44,231 --> 00:41:44,731
adventure

523
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:45,890
and

524
00:41:46,468 --> 00:41:48,946
comedy and it doesn't really overstate it's welcome.

525
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:49,780
But

526
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,420
I can see why... It's also

527
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,900
been difficult to reprint because of some of these dated

528
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:56,740
depictions.

529
00:41:57,294 --> 00:42:08,757
I I don't wanna overlook the fact that I think I didn't mention as i did the read through. But the scene where Donald is, like, blistering his way and and kind of spout nautical

530
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:09,755
nonsense.

531
00:42:10,332 --> 00:42:12,429
I I think that's one of the funniest

532
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:23,266
sequences that I've gotten to read in any of these adventure lengths. Stories. I I thought that was hilarious. So... I thought that they were pretty funny too. I almost

533
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:38,305
tried the crowds source to see if I knew anybody with sailing knowledge to see if there was any any any any basis in reality to any of the phrases he was using, but I decided nah I'm sure there's not.

534
00:42:38,645 --> 00:42:43,720
Yeah. I'm gonna just read a couple of the lines really quickly because they are that funny. It's

535
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:45,618
left the gym sail,

536
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:57,075
delay the Merlin spikes. I'm porting to the Fox to Starboard board. Okay. So that's... I think that means what I'm I'm left to the rear to the right or something.

537
00:42:57,532 --> 00:42:58,369
That's pretty awesome.

538
00:42:59,007 --> 00:43:02,356
So it's got some some inspired gag here.

539
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:08,543
Do you have any panels that stuck out for you? I do think there's some some really lovely

540
00:43:09,082 --> 00:43:10,760
maritime and South Pacific.

541
00:43:11,295 --> 00:43:14,395
Art in this one. Yeah. I thought that the...

542
00:43:15,255 --> 00:43:18,434
Just kind of the arch of Palazzo of y,

543
00:43:19,548 --> 00:43:21,364
drawings were really

544
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:22,202
pretty

545
00:43:23,376 --> 00:43:30,835
just all the little sand bars and little islands and such. I thought that was really pretty Yeah. I agree. And

546
00:43:31,335 --> 00:43:37,234
I it it looks to me like he was running from reference. You know, I don't think he drew like, generic

547
00:43:37,629 --> 00:43:39,962
south sees archipelago and that or anything.

548
00:43:40,459 --> 00:43:45,065
And it takes the whole... It takes up the whole width of the page. So it's this big panorama,

549
00:43:45,402 --> 00:43:46,354
and then you can

550
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:48,234
see some big, fluffy

551
00:43:48,614 --> 00:43:49,114
ocean

552
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:58,449
clouds off in the distance. And you just really get a good sense of scale from all of it. I really thought that that that from a technical perspective,

553
00:43:59,189 --> 00:44:01,269
it was excellent. Yeah. Definitely.

554
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,182
I really liked a panel that

555
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,099
takes place.

556
00:44:06,598 --> 00:44:09,775
The night that Glad tones boat is getting provisioned

557
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:16,222
there are two panels at the bottom of the page where Donald and silhouette and he's slumped over,

558
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:17,860
you know, despair

559
00:44:18,374 --> 00:44:28,359
glad good fortune and his bad luck. And I thought that was really cool as well as the one right next to it. And he they do a good... He does a good job with the silhouette

560
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:33,778
still portraying the emotion. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. I agree.

561
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:45,495
Barks is, you know, that one thing that doing this series has helped me realize. I didn't really understand how much he did this silhouette drawing, which looks very cool.

562
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,930
Mark when was last time that you were on a boat. Oh, yeah. That would been... I went to

563
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:54,010
Greece and Rome

564
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,019
about Yes, it's gotta be a good

565
00:44:57,634 --> 00:45:00,087
six or seven years ago now. And

566
00:45:00,623 --> 00:45:04,809
we took a little ferry boats to one of the Greek islands

567
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:05,809
in the.

568
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:10,609
That was that was pretty cool. Oh nice. I think that's the last time. I

569
00:45:10,989 --> 00:45:16,540
I don't get don't get over to the coast as much as I'd like to these days. So, yeah, thanks for asking.

570
00:45:16,959 --> 00:45:20,715
We talked a little bit about the david and archaic stuff.

571
00:45:21,567 --> 00:45:22,506
To my knowledge,

572
00:45:22,963 --> 00:45:26,574
there is not an oil painting or lit graph

573
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:33,808
of this one nor has it been made into a duck tales episode? Know, weirdly Glad Gander was used

574
00:45:34,545 --> 00:45:38,415
only in a couple of episodes in both of the runs of Ducktales.

575
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:51,474
Which I think is a shame because I think he's a he has a lot of potential as an animated character. I did find this one fairly educational though. I thought that there were a lot of neat nautical terms,

576
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:53,387
many of them used correctly

577
00:45:54,694 --> 00:46:02,862
that were very illuminati. And then there was a good sense of place of the South Pacific even if it had that kind of t

578
00:46:03,401 --> 00:46:03,901
colonial

579
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,898
perspective. Yeah. Any

580
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:16,211
any final, any closing thoughts from you Sarah. Nope. Alright. Well, thank you very much for joining me and thank you to all of our listeners.

581
00:46:16,684 --> 00:46:18,622
I'm grateful for everyone that listens.

582
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:19,541
And

583
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:32,364
you can get in touch with us at Barks remarks at g dot com or via the Facebook page. And oh, man, I am very excited for our next

584
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:39,054
episode This is a personal favorite of mine. We get to cover lost in the Andes

585
00:46:39,594 --> 00:46:46,491
next time around. So That promise to be a great episode. Please come back and

586
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:51,891
I'm gonna do my best. To keep it under two hours, but no promises.

587
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:55,187
Awesome. Thank you again. I really appreciate it.
