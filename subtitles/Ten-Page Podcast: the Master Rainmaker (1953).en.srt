Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of sc Mc Ducktales and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge con of all time

2
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:56,042
This episode is a ten page podcast all about one of his short stories, get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever marino, a grown man who enjoys Ducktales comic books and enjoys talking about them with the guests that I've gotten to meet as part of this podcast project. And I'm fortunate to have a new guest c hosts today, and I'd like to have him introduce himself. Thank you, Barks. Yeah. My name is Ruben. I'm

3
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:58,200
barely grown man that also

4
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:04,288
enjoy the the comics and have, course done since I was little kid because I am Scandinavian.

5
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:09,931
Yeah. It's I've said before, that I I feel like the Scandinavian scandinavians

6
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:12,162
have kind of partial ownership

7
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:22,717
of the bard comics because you you folks do you appreciate them so much more out there? It's really a part of culture. Where you sc as a see like

8
00:01:23,056 --> 00:01:24,250
an image of a rich

9
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:26,802
greedy man, almost a capitalism

10
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:31,883
itself sometimes. And guest goose he's... Whenever you say that someone's lazy,

11
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:43,289
you called me some gender. Yeah. Pretty much. That's awesome. Yeah. It's really embedded in culture. That's my impression, you know? That you could you could france,

12
00:01:43,747 --> 00:01:56,039
the the sc and and Donald stories and and people know what you're talking about. You know, I grew up being such a big fan but never getting to talk to anyone about them or or

13
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:59,930
sort of shared recognition. So it's it's it's a real pleasure

14
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,970
to get to to meet people. And

15
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,850
today, we are doing

16
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:11,700
an episode of the ten page part test where we look at one of Barks many

17
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:33,455
short ten pager. We usually do the adventure length stories here, but I like to... I like to take a break and really enjoy some of these funnier ones because, you know, Barks parks did a ton of these. And today, we get to talk about the master rain maker. I I'm a really excited ruben, and I gather that this is one of your favorites.

18
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:53,520
I do. I do I do... Because as a child, that I actually was more into the ten than the adventure length stories. I don't know why I was probably more of a comedy guy as a child. I I wasn't in for the trail. I was in laughs. So I really love ten. And of course, I love the series where the stories where Donald

19
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,280
mastered some profession

20
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:17,970
and well, we'll all know what happens at them. Oh, yeah. That's a great point. Right? Because this this story is one of those stories that is where he gets to master some profession. I first read this one in a collection, one of the albums that glad stone comics put out in the... I think it was the late eighties, and they called it the brittle mastery

21
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:20,720
of Donald Duck and they curated

22
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:22,433
five of those

23
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:27,551
stories together. Oh, that would sure be a to have. Absolutely.

24
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,183
And they went together perfectly

25
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,051
because they all have this sort of story structure

26
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:47,404
that that you were just talking about. Do you do you feel like you can kind of summarize what those mastery stories tend to be about Well, of course, there's always like, donald. It stocks off. It doesn't explain why, but he somehow

27
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:52,483
mastered a profession of some weird, like he's he's a hairdresser.

28
00:03:53,019 --> 00:04:07,461
He's a gardener and rolls story. Like, a really specific profession. And this one is a rain maker. Most of the time, he's doing great. Barks is showing various ways of how he masters this profession in really a really

29
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,290
way and impressive, of course And it ends

30
00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:15,756
mostly with him trying some really hard but his ego

31
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:32,348
or something like that. Knocks him over and it ends off with him. You're absolutely right. Right? He's he's at the height of his success with it. Exactly. And then comes the downfall. And it takes over. Yeah. Yeah. And and it's great. Like you said there they're these really

32
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:33,186
obscure

33
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,280
or

34
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:40,920
unexpected professions And and this one is this might be the best one of the Brittle mastery

35
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:57,789
stories. Maybe. I I love the master record, I think. Yeah. That's the contender, but this one is just such a joy read I've got a wonder. Right? You're you're Scandinavian, you're from Norway. Does this story feel like, relatable?

36
00:04:58,404 --> 00:05:15,195
I know that it's very cold and Norway, but obviously, you guys do get do get some measure of rainfall. Is there a lot of farming? It is and I live in the southern Eastern part of Norway well there is a lot of farming in Norway. Right. So It's it's mostly farm phishing and

37
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:15,855
like,

38
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:24,205
woods Yeah. Lumber jack. Lumber. That's yeah. Yeah. So, like, this is To me, this always felt like a very

39
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:25,282
quintessential

40
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:26,639
american

41
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:37,285
story. Right? Because it it feels like such a there's such a focus on water and rain. You must remember that Norway do have a really long coastline.

42
00:05:37,679 --> 00:06:12,516
So yeah I'll actually live really far from the coast, but many generations are really are they really do know hard weather. And rain and wind and stuff like that. So I believe this is really relevant. Actually really as in Norway and Scandinavia. All I believe. That's awesome. Yeah. So I generally give myself permission to go to research these a little bit less, but I know I did some some research about this because it you almost have to learn a little bit to talk about something like rain make So we'll talk a little bit about that, but I do wanna...

43
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:22,525
I do wanna talk a little bit about the specific comment. I jump around a little bit with the ten page punch So this one is a little bit later than where I am with the regular

44
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:23,365
chronology

45
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:37,795
for the adventure length stories. This one was first published. It has... It has a publication date of September nineteen fifty three. And this this of course came out in walt Disney's comics and stories

46
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:39,915
in the United States.

47
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:42,755
And yeah, that's about all the backgrounds.

48
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:52,625
Oh, I do like to mention how many reprint it has in the Us. This one's been printed to nine times total. Anything you wanted to say about the

49
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:58,640
publication of this in Norway? Well, I have to check this up and it has been reprinted

50
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:15,205
Al really big amount of time. So I I didn't check up the exact number. Actually, I have all of the publications I own in my collection right in front of me. And I was surprised to find that I do own a complete Carl box library. I do have about a third of all the weekly

51
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,256
down dot comics that I unpublished

52
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:19,212
throughout the years. So

53
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:51,664
I was really shocked to find... I'm not that big of a collector actually. Just bragging about my huge weekly collection, but I do not own everything. That's the... That is the point. And still, I do own five copies of this. Nice. And that just says something about how times minute times has been printed and how popular it is. Right. I only have... As far as I know, I only have three copies of this. Yeah. But like I said, I I read this one just over and over as a kid. It it has such a delightful

54
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,971
concept, you know? Just just to

55
00:07:55,666 --> 00:08:17,300
give a bit of a synopsis Right? The the job that Donald is very good at in this one is that he is a rain. He pilots a crop dusting plain. And he seeds the clouds to produce rain for for those who need it. And Carl Bark has like, such an interesting version

56
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:24,898
of this job, which is technically a real thing, but obviously, it's very exaggerated in this or absolutely.

57
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:46,801
So before before we go ahead, mark, I would really love to go through some of the translation of the Norwegian titles of this story. Oh, yeah. By Al it was first published actually as early as in nineteen fifty four on the year after its first publication. And then it hadn't had no title as usual. And later in nineteen seventy two, it was translated

58
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:49,912
it got pile of sol very.

59
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:57,350
Which translates to Jealous Whether. I like that then. And then the title in nineteen ninety three came that i

60
00:08:57,728 --> 00:09:06,232
familiar with Nine marketing. The rain maker. So that's the very, like, exact translation. But I was curious so I also looked into the other scandinavian

61
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:10,641
translations of this story And the swedish called it landmark,

62
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,920
the rain maker.

63
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:18,942
And also called it then free. Down the the rang marker. The flying rain, Denmark, nineteen seventy two,

64
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,041
invest

65
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,196
the the pilot of Rainy.

66
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:30,565
And this one I found really interesting. The danish title from nineteen seventy nine, I'm gonna try this danish one. Scheme seems glen,

67
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:35,904
the green monster of Jealousy. That's great. That's and we to come back to that.

68
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah. That one plays on on one of those the the more memorable. There's a lot of memorable parts and this really quick.

69
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:50,396
So let's let's do it ruben. And let's go ahead and talk about what happens in this story

70
00:09:51,030 --> 00:10:11,953
i'll I'm gonna summarize what's happening on the first page and then then we're gonna alternate. And and as we have comments, we're gonna go ahead and make them. So right right off to bat on the first page of the master rain maker. We see Donald. I I like this. We we already see him as you mentioned like in the middle of it. You know? We don't... Barks isn't interested.

71
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:20,586
He only has ten pages. So he doesn't wanna show him getting good at it. He's already good. And we see him in the process of taking an order

72
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:22,102
or reign

73
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:23,936
from a very stereotypical

74
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,025
looking farmer. It's the works farmer.

75
00:10:27,598 --> 00:10:29,454
Yes. One of Barks pro

76
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,810
farmers.

77
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:40,685
I like that in the narrator box, he refers to him as donald duck m r m. As though it's like a degree credential, masculine

78
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:41,565
maker.

79
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:51,460
And he just he editorial in the narrator box. He says the boy is good. So Marx is is being very economical.

80
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,595
He's telling us exactly what we need to know at the beginning. He is perfect

81
00:10:55,935 --> 00:11:08,704
making rain and he's very good. And and so he's taking an order from this farmer for two inches of rain on an x shaped field. And there's this great bit of,

82
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,627
like, almost menu taking where Donald is telling him his prices for

83
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:28,274
square round or s shaped and and he gives him a price based on the x field being a little bit more difficult. And the farmer is very specific. He doesn't want any ring to fall on his Huey,.

84
00:11:28,274 --> 00:12:04,675
Next door. And and so we see a little bit more of the mechanics of Donald setting up and and Huey, dewey Louis are clearly key assistance. They helped Donald set up and he prepares to take off. Any any comments on this great opening page ruben? Not anything more than you really see how like, confident don here. It knows this stuff. She's still on the earth. He really knows the stuff and it's not like, over the top. Yeah. He's proud of it, but it doesn't show that show it that much. Right. He's just someone who who knows what he's. Yeah. Okay. I'll go ahead. So we see Al typing off. He's see a couple of clouds I hit news

85
00:12:05,255 --> 00:12:27,845
but these are some real stubborn clouds. He really does have done is pushing into the clouds, but they're stubborn are not moving. And the plane is loading up like a fist. I'm going for it one second time, but the clouds still won't move. There... So he backs up and he uses the propeller to drag the clouds in the other way. Maybe you could describe it a little more

86
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:28,545
detail.

87
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:39,064
I think you caught it. Right? They're very stubborn. So he's like anchoring the plane with like a toe line and using this propeller to blow them backwards.

88
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,845
Exactly. And we've got this great element where the the clouds are much more physical

89
00:12:45,342 --> 00:12:45,842
than

90
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:49,970
than true clouds. Are. Right? Like like, they have...

91
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,970
They have a real sense of

92
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,390
like marshmallow. Yeah.

93
00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:08,351
Yeah know, i like Marshmallow mel. And I love the little, like, almost bull or blade that he's got that he's trying Yeah. And I really love how the gold are blade is right in front of the propeller. And

94
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:33,905
you actually just, like block what make the plane go forward. We just ignore that. It looks great. It's good too way. That's our... That's our cartoon logic there. So Donald on the next page, you know, he manages to to heard the clouds where he needs them to be over the farmers field. And we've got these great panels of him using the plane to essentially

95
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:34,745
shave

96
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:38,280
bits of the cloud off so that it forms this perfect

97
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,680
x. And then he...

98
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:49,610
And then he sees the clouds. He drops some stuff on the clouds to produce the rain. And

99
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:54,205
and the clouds start the rain and we kind of cut to the the farmer

100
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,300
and his wife, I assume also a farmer and they are ad

101
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,700
the rain and there's this just

102
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,435
fantastic dad

103
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:10,787
where the the drops that are falling on the property line even have one flat side to come right up.

104
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,175
Sure is a favorite of my. It's really memorable.

105
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:20,135
So it it'll drop the falls on the top of the fence, they they won't cross over to the other side of the

106
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:30,578
they stop in the middle. They're not going in photo, and I love that. I think it's one of the most memorable things in this story. And it's it's delightful. It's over the top. It's super cartoon ish,

107
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:34,740
but it works within the context of this story. It does...

108
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:39,535
So on the next page, the first panel we see is the former

109
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:41,095
stereotypical k

110
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:43,915
Barks farmer with the overalls and a goats.

111
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:47,466
Beard looks as it looks at his

112
00:14:47,964 --> 00:14:49,143
reign measurement

113
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:51,420
tool and it's precisely

114
00:14:51,775 --> 00:15:00,329
the amount that asked for not even a millimeter over or a millimeter this just what he asked for. So this really shows out of a perfection

115
00:15:00,748 --> 00:15:06,083
don't in this. So he's back on the he has ladder the plane he's background the ground, and

116
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:19,517
the nephews are giving him one other job. So it's another farmer that we will... Could you do the pound? Could you do the word to text extended this panel with third panel? Yeah. Because I'm kinda curious what

117
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:29,381
how they call it in in your printing. So the farmer is named farmer pumpkin deal. Which is a great Barks name. And he's put in an order

118
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,595
for an inch and a half of slow rain on his goose berries.

119
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:40,110
Yeah. And I would... I will I really have to disappoint too. It's not a good name. His name farmer Pumpkin.

120
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:42,965
That's not a good norwegian

121
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:44,085
name and

122
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:48,105
to be honest. What's the crop? Do they keep it Goose berries?

123
00:15:49,396 --> 00:15:56,885
I'm really not sure what these kind of berries are in or where art English. They're called in Norway, They are called sticky by

124
00:15:57,464 --> 00:16:05,836
barriers, Is that something that we were say? No. Never. Do not. Oh, okay. I'm no way. You typically know about Lingo berries only because of

125
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:15,911
Ikea. That's... Yeah. Okay. Sorry. I do not know the english name of these kind of coronavirus. Yeah. So so Goose varies is weird too because those have gone out of popularity

126
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:17,324
in heard.

127
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:24,196
They're... You do not see them. I think that they were more popular when these were first published.

128
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:28,130
Okay. But I don't even know what they are. I... But I'm never

129
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:34,062
or eating a goose barrier. Yeah. Okay. So it's a square plane, So it should be easy.

130
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,811
But in the middle of it, his wife is having

131
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:37,967
their wet

132
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:51,633
cleaned clothes out for dry. She doesn't and the wife doesn't want their clothes to be wet. So the the nephew put the tool on the plane, that make right for another flight. And we fly over the

133
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:57,825
the property and it's really simple. It's really square. It has house in the middle of it. We can see

134
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:25,073
the wet clothes in the middle and that, of course starts... He finds there clouds right nearby and he starts pumping and funding and to together able to just a perfect square size. And then it do... That's the same thing as then last page where he is shading off the top of the cloud. It's just like how i it pushes the top of the and goes just like for lovely see. Yeah. I I love the art. In general

135
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:30,498
and manipulate the clouds. It's it's a delay to look at. And

136
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:40,634
so on the next page, you know, we get the little payoff of that tool you were talking about that they put on where he he turns into a corpse screw

137
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:48,016
maneuver and he just carve out this little disc shaped empty spot to address the farmers

138
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,190
wife's

139
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,030
laundry that's out to dry. And we get this perfect

140
00:17:53,330 --> 00:18:23,613
rain. This farmer has ordered a slow range Right? Yeah. There's a great gag in English. His wife asks, is that rain slow enough for you hi, and he says yep. Them drops even stop and look around before landing. And and we see another great gag that's just so over the top about what a good job Donald is doing, the little space that he's cleared for her laundry even accounts for the ruffles on her party dress. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's it's hilarious.

141
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:35,799
And then the very end of the page, you know, is where Barks kinda sets up the downfall. He has a narration bot that says like every other genius. This this fabulous rain

142
00:18:36,178 --> 00:19:00,480
has a weak spot. It is of course a girl. And we see Donald with the t balloon thinking about a giggling days. And it's a hard shaped thought balloon as well. Yes. Which is a nice touch. Yeah. Oh, man. This this next page is great. Tell us, tell us about this one. Before we do that, I would just like to comment something about the Barks group. Yeah. Because it kinda bugs me in a way that... But in norwegian translation,

143
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,960
we see a here. Well, it drives up. It's Scrooge the

144
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:26,125
The waves go screw as i go up and then... In on the next panel, you can see in coming on the side of the cloud with that big... It looks like a cor. But in an norwegian translation, it basically says where it says, I feel just like a cork group. And I kinda think that that's just that it's too much you don't need that. That's what you see. Yeah. It's it's a little.

145
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:36,035
High. Not it's not showing tell. It's show and telling. That's kinda... You don't mean that it really reload me that a couple times. Yeah. But yeah, The next page, I'll go ahead. So

146
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:40,684
we're back with donald. Obvious as a break. He's not wearing his pilot goggles

147
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:55,582
and it's talking daisy and asking if she would like to drive on a trip and this is in the next panel saying that, oh, I'm sorry. Actually have other plans because I thought they were busy, and i love this speaking balloon coming from the from daisy phone, being dull

148
00:19:56,015 --> 00:20:09,277
we're saying, what are plans that really just the speech bubble is just dropping. What how would you describe that next? So to me it looks like it's it's being covered with ice. Right? Like Yeah. Exactly. They're forming,

149
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:11,193
you know, just the cold.

150
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:34,757
Yeah. In and how Donald demeanor has turned has turned cold and upset. You're you're right it's a great. That's a great way to show it. So obviously, he's feelings just turned from being hard shaped in his eyes, and we don't see it, but now it's stone cold. U. And it doesn't get in better. When he learns that daisy say is data plans actually are with Gladstone.

151
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:38,070
So we see that green and ghost of jealousy.

152
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:43,030
Degree... I'm sorry. The green monster feels Jealousy, poking tunnel in the back with

153
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,669
don't been furious.

154
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:46,324
And this and

155
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,959
that jealousy

156
00:20:49,174 --> 00:21:11,807
master just... It's like... You know those good old cartoons where like a devil on one side and the angel one side. This is obviously the devil. Yeah. Talking down and... Are you gonna take this? Alright? Or you gonna... Aren't you gonna fix this and don't ends up, of course, few minutes thinking, oh, yeah. I'm gonna fix this. So it jumps right into the plane, not knowing where they're going. But unfortunately, it does see

157
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:16,832
Glen car from the sky, he decides to follow them to their location. Yeah.

158
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,090
This

159
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:20,325
this page room and is

160
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:28,078
great. It is... Pretty wild. Right? Because Barks does that's a lot going on. There is a lot going on.

161
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:31,707
The this eyed monster is how it's labeled.

162
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,754
I don't know if this is the same

163
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:40,080
in in Norwegian, but this this is like a reference to jealousy.

164
00:21:40,534 --> 00:22:05,696
In English, it's a little old fashioned. But in English, you can literally call jealousy, the green eyed monster. Yeah. Okay. That doesn't doesn't translate as so. But it basically says, well, fortunately, Marx does have a little here's the text and it's pointing at that monster telling the reader where. And in my addition, it the green ghost of Jealousy or the grain monster of Real. And that's very

165
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:16,475
be. You know it started it from this too as a kid, because this was probably where I learned about this whole saying. When i read this when I was say years zone So it's not a good

166
00:22:17,215 --> 00:22:24,235
norwegian term, Rna and any case, but it just works in this because it's obvious based that it's fictional and

167
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:29,082
that is it it's very clear what is happening that it's like this

168
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,113
representation. It's so funny though. This this monster that's

169
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:33,930
him,

170
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:37,015
and and amp up his jealousy.

171
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:44,468
And it looks like though as well. It does. Yeah. It's like if it... It's like a dull cross with a dragon. So Yeah. And and the devil.

172
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:51,371
Can I ask you what do they call the group? That Gladstone is part of and this? Oh, yeah. So

173
00:22:51,684 --> 00:23:19,112
translate well. So it's translated into... I'll just go ahead. It's it's the golden idle dam this english. And in norway they call it dog delivery recruitment, which is basically the day driver club and the day driver. I believe that's the term that doesn't work in English. I mean, if if I if I had to guess, it's someone who doesn't have to work and just goes off for like, a for like, a nice pleasant drive. Yeah. It's a person that doesn't not want to work. Actually,

174
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:28,617
so... yeah. They're just like they would rather just lie on tree and looking at the other people who that sounds like a pretty pretty good translate addition to me solid at least. Again,

175
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:30,471
going back to

176
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:34,510
when I send at the introduction about these characters being so

177
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:40,409
implemented into the Norwegian culture actually Gladstone other, and goose again are excellent

178
00:23:40,865 --> 00:23:42,180
examples of day drivers.

179
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:50,147
Right. It's it's such a weird they're called the idle Dandy like you said. And it's such a weird old fashioned term, You know

180
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:52,679
it is like someone fancy.

181
00:23:53,340 --> 00:24:06,927
Exactly. But it... But that term is is well out of bone. The next page, you know, has the idle dandy that they're pit and and Glad and Daisy are having a nice time. And at some point, Daisy notices

182
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,059
what she's

183
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:14,392
recognizes this as Donald plane lying about overhead. And, you know, Gladstone

184
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:21,100
is talking about, oh, he's Jealous, he should he should get out of here. And Donald does head away,

185
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:25,149
but it's just so that he can w up some

186
00:24:25,729 --> 00:24:26,828
really men

187
00:24:27,686 --> 00:24:30,503
clouds. And he clearly spur them into

188
00:24:30,962 --> 00:24:32,780
creating a pretty spectacular

189
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:34,391
storm over

190
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:36,704
the the idle picnic

191
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,105
beast stick. You did find a lot of bit bad films. It's a really impressive it's just a big storm.

192
00:24:42,918 --> 00:24:47,204
Right. And it and it happens like, very suddenly, it's very clear. Absolutely.

193
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:54,315
So I do really enjoy how the comments. Really early on this page where they says that oh, isn't this

194
00:24:54,852 --> 00:25:21,237
federal whether just lovely and go glad and, of course, just. Would you like to say the got Gladstone offline here? Yeah. He says it's always perfect. When I'm around, you know, referencing with Gladstone still look. But you're right. It's a nice... It's a nice setup for how the weather is great and is obviously gonna take a turn. And also right before we see donald and what clouds they found we can see the Club. They're really having a ball there. They're really hungry.

195
00:25:21,614 --> 00:25:47,743
Yeah. Is yeah Throw throwing themselves over that food. So, yeah, don't now have gather rid the clouds and the club down in the valley is now really feeling how that storm is gathering up on them, and they are finding it better to just leave because this storm is not a place for a good picnic. And Doll doesn't think of this storm is enough. So he is dropping that weird powder on these clouds again with blizzard.

196
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:56,211
So now that that's though there... And all the other people club. Oh my god. Knowing they really do have to get going now. But unfortunately,

197
00:25:56,668 --> 00:25:59,774
Gladstone really fancy the car won't start

198
00:26:00,153 --> 00:26:03,285
because the model has frozen. So even though

199
00:26:03,623 --> 00:26:10,859
the idle dam is really hate this, they find out that they would have to stay and do the job of making a fire. Yeah This is really...

200
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:14,799
It really shows a crisis scene right now. Yeah. You're right. This is

201
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:20,214
me how it's shown how quickly Donald been able to turn the weather. Absolutely.

202
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:26,935
And and this Al happens again so fast. It's just a couple of pages. He's working so quickly with this.

203
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:42,159
Onto the next page, you know, is where it's it really takes a turn. Donald decides that he wants to look at his work. And so he prepares to dive through the clouds and his plane just crashes

204
00:26:42,698 --> 00:26:47,890
spectacularly. As though it's run to the ground because it turns out he has

205
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,850
oversee and the clouds have turned into a solid

206
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,970
dome of ice.

207
00:26:54,444 --> 00:26:56,942
And and so now we've got this terrible

208
00:26:57,281 --> 00:27:00,337
situation where Donald has gone too far. He's

209
00:27:00,956 --> 00:27:05,910
he's mastered his craft, but it's back backfired on him because he's led jealousy.

210
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,550
Provoke him into this.

211
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,390
Where

212
00:27:10,864 --> 00:27:13,961
everyone below is in danger of the clouds

213
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,929
shattering and crushing them. And so he's forced to parachute through this one hole

214
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:23,485
the clouds and warn them to to get out and and

215
00:27:24,024 --> 00:27:35,831
they initially are ignoring his warnings. Because they've got a fire and and because they are the idle dandy, they say, we're just gonna wait here for the highway Scrooge to rescue.

216
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:42,362
These people didn't don't. They don't they are lazy people. They only use their Barks if they're moving somewhere. Right.

217
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,939
You know there's... I just noticed this. And I haven't i didn't check this against my other reprint. But

218
00:27:49,397 --> 00:27:51,174
the dandy that's in the background

219
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:54,766
on the last panel of this page has a

220
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:56,497
shirt that is colored

221
00:27:57,992 --> 00:28:01,246
of of Charlie Brown. Oh, it's the charlie brown.

222
00:28:01,784 --> 00:28:11,765
And. Never know it doesn't matter that as well. Those little zigzag. So I guess it looks like that on yours as well. Yeah. And it's colored yellow as well. Yeah. That's interesting. And the peanuts

223
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:16,575
did exist the time didn't? Yeah. I think Peanut started out in the...

224
00:28:16,914 --> 00:28:23,141
That's poised. This... I I think it must've have been about a contemporary here. I'll take a look, When did Peanuts start?

225
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,812
Yeah. First published in nineteen forty seven and moe

226
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:33,939
renamed Peanuts in nineteen fifty. So that's a fun fun little gag apparently or or

227
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,219
and coincidence.

228
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:37,819
And we also should mention that

229
00:28:38,213 --> 00:28:55,220
these clouds to have frozen and the reason they're not dropping down it's because the resting thing on the mountain tops. Yes. That's that's an important catch. Right? Yeah. So they're not just hovering in the air. They're kind of resting on on mountain tops like said. So when these these clouds will melt, basically,

230
00:28:55,834 --> 00:29:05,007
a bunch of big ice Barks crashed into the valley. So really don't really put people in danger here. The He's killing is girlfriend for this this was a a big

231
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:07,241
catastrophic mess up. Absolutely.

232
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:49,652
So we'll see how it goes. I'll go over with the next page. So donald now has gone into this he's parachute into the valley and it's saying that we really do need to get out of here. Do these ice they'll collapse they don't care until they hear a really big crack up in the sky and it's just great expressions on Barks faces right there. Now they really understand the danger and they're running their actually ice skating. With that very nice case. I'm not sure how how much that will work. But actually that are getting out there there, just in the last moment before we see just a big blocks eyes are crushing on the top from the... It's like actually a roof on top of the Al there and it just collapsed the skin to the valley. And all the

233
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,668
members of the

234
00:29:51,426 --> 00:30:03,350
Club are really sorry now because their cars have been ruined. And one of the members Gladstone though, why did this guy know the clouds being in danger of us.

235
00:30:04,484 --> 00:30:07,956
I read the bit of dialogue in English. Because i had ahead...

236
00:30:08,794 --> 00:30:09,294
Yes.

237
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:14,276
How did that duck know those clouds where I and Gladstone

238
00:30:14,316 --> 00:30:15,154
sm, and he says,

239
00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:19,007
I've got news for you Chu Al Donald

240
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,641
s guilt over.

241
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:36,252
So in the last couple of panels, we see another farmer. We're back with the voice at what seems to be Double dutch rain maker headquarters. And he really begs for the Ducktales. Where is that master rain maker? I really do need some some water on my fields. And

242
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,070
nephews have to apologize.

243
00:30:38,643 --> 00:30:47,660
Because though he's location in Tim. Yes. Yes. Really it's a it's a classic Barks ending. It it is. Right? Tim too is one of those

244
00:30:48,080 --> 00:31:01,979
place names that is just funny to people. And so there's a tradition in in at least American pop culture of if you have to, like, run away and escape to somewhere. It's a good... It's a good destination.

245
00:31:02,436 --> 00:31:02,755
Yeah.

246
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:10,950
And you know that farmer in in the English printing. He's named mister Corn silk, and he's begging for water for his Vegas.

247
00:31:11,324 --> 00:31:18,049
And and in and in English at least Rut vega is just one of those, like, funny words. It's almost a punchline.

248
00:31:18,426 --> 00:31:18,865
Yeah.

249
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:25,048
So so Ruben this this is just... This is some incredibly tight story.

250
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:31,208
Right? He and he's he's so small practice with this and he's he did so many of these ten pager.

251
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:36,312
But to set up this story structure where he's got these two

252
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:41,240
demonstrations of this complete mastery and and then this

253
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,680
incredibly memorable

254
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:56,075
failure is is so awesome. You know what I love about all of these brittle mas stories is that it's it's almost always his own fault. And if he just if he didn't let himself

255
00:31:56,492 --> 00:32:05,980
get carried away or let his jealousy get the best of him. He could have had a very successful run of doing this. Absolutely. And it also

256
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:18,125
mostly kind of bug me that, yeah, he did make a big mistake he he really screwed up he erased people lives in this story, but it's still a good rain who could he can still handle that profession. Yeah. Got

257
00:32:18,543 --> 00:32:29,320
It's a double story. It needs to the round up with Well, he doesn't do that anymore. He's back into doing something else. Right. Yeah. We've gotta get that big reset. He's gotta finish

258
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:30,137
Exactly.

259
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:31,549
So you know,

260
00:32:32,388 --> 00:32:40,340
I I mentioned that I... This is definitely one of the ten pager that stands out for me. Obviously, it's it's a favorite of yours.

261
00:32:40,754 --> 00:33:09,790
I I like to check and on what the community thinks about these, you know, by by using the site in index and they let anyone vote on their stories. And and they usually get enough people voting that it gives you a pretty good idea. And so this one is ranked very highly. For a ten page or at least it. This one has a seven point five out of ten, which is good for rank two hundred and forty nine. Out of all like, forty one thousand some... Yeah. Disney comics.

262
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,765
That sure is impressive Yeah. It's a high one. And I am

263
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:30,885
obsessed enough that I actually went and made a list of the ten pager. Just so that I could reference those how they compared to each other? That's interesting. Yeah. And so this one, let's see. So as of when I made this list, This one is the eighteenth

264
00:33:31,825 --> 00:33:35,325
highest rated of all of his ten pager. So

265
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:58,103
sleep very highly regarded very well. Remember. And and it's such a great high concept, you know, the the rain may i didn't really talk too much about about this. But rain making, I I I learned a little bit about it. I don't know if you looked up too much about it. Yeah. I have... I I look at the a couple of youtube do videos. To me the interesting thing about rain making is that it's a very

266
00:33:58,881 --> 00:33:59,381
exact

267
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:05,035
science. Right? There's Al there's a lot of disagreement over how well it works.

268
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:11,603
If it works at all. You know, I I learned that they used a rain stuff to make it the silver.

269
00:34:11,941 --> 00:34:23,168
Can't remember what kind of silver they use to see. They use like C two. They use silver Huey, use even just dry ice. I didn't see any like being and Critical little about it.

270
00:34:24,007 --> 00:34:25,844
Just telling about how it works,

271
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:38,054
why people doing it. And it's well it's called cloud seating, and Cnn described as adding a chemical to clouds to increase rain or snowfall. And I really learned that the way box

272
00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:45,026
represents this the story. Even though it's really comic with cuba a comedy in this, it's really actually pretty

273
00:34:45,522 --> 00:35:20,765
an good representation because we can't make clouds. We can only target clouds that we already have a voice sure. And then actually do put some chemicals on top of this. So it's just like Barks represented in the story. Yeah. Other people And people always ask why they don't use this red drought or forest fires? And that's because you can make clouds. And what do I use it for? Well, the only thing I could find is that power companies would like more now more snow up in the mountains that could fit the streams and rivers when there's no melts. Yeah. I I read a few uses for it.

274
00:35:21,104 --> 00:35:24,441
One big one is, like ski resorts, I guess, well

275
00:35:25,314 --> 00:35:28,383
use it to get more powder or snow on their slopes.

276
00:35:28,981 --> 00:35:37,116
But apparently, the Chinese government used it because you can use it in advance. To try and make the rain happen early

277
00:35:37,815 --> 00:35:42,330
instead of it happening on, like, the forecast today, so they they used it in advance of the

278
00:35:43,104 --> 00:35:43,604
Recently.

279
00:35:44,064 --> 00:35:48,684
Yeah. Yeah. I I didn't see that. It was the Al Olympics. Yeah. That's right.

280
00:35:49,424 --> 00:35:53,379
You know what I found that that was really interesting into to me Ruben.

281
00:35:54,557 --> 00:35:55,416
There's someone

282
00:35:55,835 --> 00:35:58,333
someone put up a video on Youtube

283
00:35:58,912 --> 00:35:59,412
of

284
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:05,904
images from this story. Pointing to it as like a conspiracy theory. I don't know if you're

285
00:36:06,284 --> 00:36:08,264
with the people who talk about

286
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:24,865
con hem trails. Do you know what Chem trails are? No. I don't please go ahead and explain. So there's this big conspiracy theory. I think it's widespread around the world, but I know there are a lot of cra in the Us who subscribed to it. That say that the government drops chemicals

287
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:29,728
Oh yeah. I've heard about that. For, you know, like, mind control purpose.

288
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:30,526
Exactly.

289
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:37,670
And and it... It's pretty hilarious there they're basically accusing Barks of having been somewhat

290
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:55,131
I don't I don't know what the conspiracy is. but there there's some very funny, like, comments about oh, look at this. You know where to look. You you can find that they've always been trying to control us. So Yeah. Even in the Du universe, they did. Right. So that's why... It's why all the humans are black.

291
00:36:55,469 --> 00:36:57,065
Yes. Yes. Exactly.

292
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:14,634
But also in my research, just Al a little short one at the end, the same cnn m video said that this technology cloud sitting, was this actually discovered in nineteen forty six. So it did exist at the time that Barks may distort. Yeah. It goes back. And, you know, Barks is really

293
00:37:14,948 --> 00:37:20,872
in some of the stories, he's really at the cutting edge. Yeah. Of there's a lot of, like, new technology

294
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:27,072
discussed in a lot of these. And and it's interesting. I I grew up reading these in the eighties and nineties.

295
00:37:27,451 --> 00:38:00,741
And by then, a lot of it was very old and and quaint, but But at the time, a lot of it really was very cutting edge. And cloud isn't actually real very known technology. Not nothing's not in my country at least, so I still believe that this seems a bit future taken away. The way I can control whether and the way it's presented. It's in a comedic way. Of course. It's hilarious. It is hilarious. The the the concept he has, you know, the seeding in the clouds obviously is something that people do. But the way he w

296
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:26,920
the clouds around, like, like, he's almost in a rodeo or or hurting herding cattle. That's that's the Huey, yeah. That sure is my favorite aspect aspects of a story and I believe that's why I reread it so many times when I was younger is to see that playing fly just like a fist into those to clouds and cork screwing, the shaving, forming those clouds to be the perfect way for make it rain on top of the farms, just marvelous.

297
00:38:27,614 --> 00:38:29,353
Yeah. It's it's incredibly

298
00:38:29,732 --> 00:38:30,232
clever.

299
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:51,116
Well before we wrap it up, you know, we talked about... I you like to to ask if you've got any favorite panels. I know we've already mentioned some that stand out, but are are there any rubin that you wanted to really highlight? I will say the first that comes to mind is on the it's on the fourth page and it's the second

300
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:51,730
last

301
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:59,842
one where it says fun bump Al donald pushes this shape into this cloud into the perfect Scrooge.

302
00:39:00,281 --> 00:39:03,628
That's just Marble. And of course, the course one I already talked about.

303
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:05,562
It's such a great

304
00:39:05,938 --> 00:39:14,770
way to show this. That really shows off how Barks really used to work with animation at Al business studios videos. Really it feels like animation

305
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:22,345
when reading it we mentioned a bunch of great panels in this. There for such a quick story. There are just a ton of great panels.

306
00:39:22,765 --> 00:39:36,175
But the the bits with the Green eyed monster are awesome some and all of the bits with the clouds being manipulated into... Absolutely, I love every one of them there's how much by And then when the plane when the plane crashes...

307
00:39:36,515 --> 00:39:56,935
Oh, yeah. Locked. Device. I I mean, the art is good. But it's more of the that little shock when I originally read it, you know, it's such a great surprising moment. It's it's super unlikely, but it's it's a great moment. And also the panel before it's actually just showing how he's really diving into the clouds. It's moving vertically on this.

308
00:39:57,575 --> 00:40:02,126
And it's moving really fast. Yeah. So you definitely feel his impact. Absolutely.

309
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:20,944
