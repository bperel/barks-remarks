00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:55,858
Hello, and welcome to Barks remark. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks, creator of sc Mc and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comics of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological publishing or We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome listeners You are about to listen to an episode of Mark's remarks that I hope is not plain awful. Before I get to the regularly

2
00:00:56,275 --> 00:01:07,255
recorded episode, a couple of quick notes, First, I mistakenly said in the episode that this one is the highest rated non uncle Scrooge story but after recording, I realized that wasn't quite accurate.

3
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,510
Rather the golden helmet is rated slightly higher on index.

4
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,790
Also, I wish in hindsight that I had spoken a little bit more about the plane

5
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:32,603
Themselves. And some of the implications of their society being so quick to imitate outsiders. But I suppose I can always wait a couple of years and eventually cover Don Rose Sequel. So speaking of which I also learned after recording that Barks oil painting returned to plain awful,

6
00:01:33,020 --> 00:02:01,385
apparently did proceed the Don Rosa story. Thus answering that chicken egg first question. I'm sure there will be a few more errors or emissions because it's impossible to cover absolutely everything about a great story like lost in the Andes, but please enjoy. Welcome back everyone to Barks remarks. And I'm Mark Sever, a Carl Barks fan on his eighteenth podcast who finally gets to talk about one of his all time favorite stories. We have a very full house

7
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:03,793
today to discuss landmark

8
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:06,105
story lost in the Andes.

9
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:12,702
And I've been super excited to get to this one. So I wanna jump right in with

10
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,460
introductions.

11
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:16,219
I have almost

12
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:19,275
every host returning for this one today.

13
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:27,162
Because I I couldn't bear to leave anyone out. So I I'm gonna have these guys introduce themselves

14
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:28,255
And then

15
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:35,430
after they say their name, I want them to tell us whether they think this one deserves

16
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:40,404
Its reputation has one of Barks most famous stories.

17
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:41,243
Eric.

18
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:44,560
I am Eric partly currently lost in Arizona.

19
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:49,301
Yes. This is a very much landmark

20
00:02:49,678 --> 00:02:50,178
creative

21
00:02:50,834 --> 00:03:02,350
completely out story that is fantastic and holds up Awesome. And and you've read this one in the past. I think you're the only other person here who'd read it before. Right? Yeah. And we this one. Awesome.

22
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:12,516
Ryan. I'm Ryan Bailey. I'm from yet another time zone. I think it's fitting that the most popular Ducktales comics podcast on the planet

23
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:19,890
should physically cover the entire planet. I do think this one is... It definitely stands out. It has a lot going on.

24
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,605
In a pretty

25
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:25,545
small package. I think other people probably would've have told this story over more issues,

26
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:28,644
but he's good at kind of condensing things and

27
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:32,969
there's a lot of originality to it, and it's just kind of a crazy

28
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:34,503
adventure. Awesome.

29
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:40,683
Alright. And ben. Yeah. My name is Ben. And yeah. In Arizona also. And...

30
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:42,641
Yeah. This is a good one. I I've

31
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,318
read very few of the issues,

32
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:51,320
but, yeah, the ones that I've read I was more... I was more of a fan of the the cartoon

33
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:58,135
and I've only recently kinda started reading some of these. So I'm I'm really enjoying it and. This is a good issue. Barks.

34
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:04,495
And, you know, I'm I'm excited. I feel like the theme song that I've picked for the podcast.

35
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,450
Really

36
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:11,129
really fits well our hail the games all here because we all go way back and,

37
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,224
you know, this honestly is kind of almost the fruition of my

38
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:24,478
villainous scheme here to finally get all my former roommates to to read this story that I love so much. So

39
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:27,108
you guys have fallen into my clutches.

40
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:30,574
And let's let's do it. Let's get into

41
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:32,780
lost in the Andes.

42
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:34,493
This is

43
00:04:34,869 --> 00:04:36,365
a comic that was

44
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:40,050
first published in February of nineteen

45
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:50,741
forty nine, this was in four color two hundred and twenty three and there have been not as many reprint as I thought, including the original one, there's been eight of them. But

46
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,430
but again, this is kind of one of those signature stories where if you ask anyone

47
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:01,789
who who knows about Carl Barks. This is kind of the story that

48
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:15,561
everyone has been a name. At least of the Donald Duck ones. Right? I think that this is probably the most famous of his stories that doesn't include uncle sc in it. This is a long adventure story. This is thirty two pages.

49
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,545
You know, you mentioned Ryan that this might be told over more issues in a different

50
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:24,125
era and... That that could have been really fascinating to see.

51
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:31,913
At some point, It might have you read Don Rose Sequel because that adds a element to it as well. This is

52
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,390
the the famous

53
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:41,390
square egg story. It's kind of everyone's shorthand. For it. Right? Donald and the boys are gonna search for square eggs

54
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:43,468
hidden in a lost

55
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:46,565
civilization high in the peruvian andes.

56
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:54,181
And fitting fitting with Barks famous, most famous story, there's a lot of of kind of background trivia

57
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:58,230
that is associated with this one. So this is the podcast

58
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:06,614
highest rated story so far. And this is... I think part of the reputation is because this is one that Carl Barks

59
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:10,250
himself frequently mentioned as his favorite.

60
00:06:10,823 --> 00:06:19,236
And he wasn't consistent about this. You know, he would mention other ones. But if you google it, this is the one that probably comes up the most often.

61
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,949
This is his second lost

62
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,509
civilization story

63
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,430
after mystery of the swamp

64
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:29,657
I know I had Ryan on for that episode.

65
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:34,405
Eric, you got to read that story as well. Ben, did I have you that odd ball one?

66
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,680
I don't know if you asked me too, but I do I did read that one that was. Yeah. I I think that his like lost

67
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:48,925
civilization one are kind of what he's best know yeah. And and I thought it was kind of unusual that both of them feature like, square dancing

68
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,900
randomly as no and.

69
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,020
And and so this was again, he wrote this at a time where his domestic life was really

70
00:06:58,374 --> 00:06:59,392
sort of a mess.

71
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:04,178
I I found a quote that said his his second wife, Clara was

72
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:06,331
having some addiction challenges

73
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:12,415
and was quote coming part at the seams. And by his account, she was increasingly violent.

74
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:13,454
And,

75
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:23,406
you know, she she would go on to, like, they they divorced shortly after this period and she had some significant medical challenges. And

76
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:30,599
a lot of people have mentioned that that Barks kind of really threw himself into his work

77
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:37,194
around this time. And so this era of his stories are kinda considered his most fruitful,

78
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:39,074
most productive.

79
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:56,055
I don't know if I wanna buy too much into the like tortured artist escaping into it into into his work because, you know, that has a weird dynamic, but that's just something that kinda comes up. He was... He considered himself an armed chair Al explorer and national

80
00:07:56,355 --> 00:07:58,095
geographic fan who

81
00:07:58,475 --> 00:08:12,178
he he never left the country for the first time until very late in his life. And so he kind of would explore them and the the world through his material. And I don't know about you guys, but, like, I felt like this was a really good

82
00:08:12,594 --> 00:08:14,369
window into and

83
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:25,820
civilization I think he tries to do it right, promising some of the key details, but not actually experienced it there. Right. And and to me, this one looked like he was using a reference.

84
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:38,074
This one, they they just seem like citizens of the people of the andes. Let's see Barks did have a brief stint early in his life as a chicken farmer. So I suspect that

85
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:40,071
that might have played into his

86
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:44,176
his decision to base this story around eggs.

87
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:53,840
And, yeah. He's quoted as saying my best story technically is probably the square a one. There there's a splash panel late into this

88
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,031
really spectacular one where they view the the civilization playing awful for the first time.

89
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:01,051
And

90
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:10,735
I love it, but he he is quoted as saying I botched up my perspective a little in drawing that. I should have laid out all these squares

91
00:09:11,274 --> 00:09:13,132
down here by measuring points

92
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:23,005
instead of from the vanishing point. And he mentioned that a neighbor was talking to him and distracting him while he drew it. So that was just something that I learned, in know research jerk.

93
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:24,399
Yes.

94
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:30,010
And then this was really interesting to me. I I put out a call on the carl Barks

95
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:34,835
Facebook group that got shared on the Don Rosa group as well. Asking

96
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:38,405
about playing awful itself, the name of the civilization.

97
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:43,425
And I I I went down the the Rabbit hole I learned from

98
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:47,731
someone who shared this that there was a big

99
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:49,705
Norwegian controversy

100
00:09:50,125 --> 00:10:02,854
with this story. And quote, the story gained a lot of attention when it was first published in the Norwegian language in nineteen sixty three, because the translator chosen Barks archaic and slightly garbled version

101
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:03,665
of

102
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:05,423
mean York

103
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:08,740
for the for the plain.

104
00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:15,310
And that that was kind of widely viewed as an insult. Because it was kind of the back,

105
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,790
you know, the backwards

106
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,870
version of Norwegian. And in later additions, the language was altered

107
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:25,885
So that that story got a lot of attention in Norwegian

108
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:26,685
media.

109
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:27,845
And

110
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:30,405
this story is well loved

111
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:34,217
in norway especially. And here is how listener,

112
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:35,695
Y Abel

113
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:44,739
Characterized it. He said, I will not claimed that the country was set on fire in nineteen sixty three, but the country was set on fire.

114
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:47,855
Everybody got mad, especially the new

115
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:53,758
card miners in Nord my, an interest group for the advancement of the Knee Language.

116
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:56,853
Alright. So you guys, I I like to

117
00:10:57,311 --> 00:11:08,998
talk about some of the different titles as well from around the world. So I've just picked a few. We might do a few more later. Eric, do you want to tell us the title you're gonna you're gonna wrap your mouth around.

118
00:11:09,697 --> 00:11:10,636
In Italian,

119
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:13,852
it's e in studio betty

120
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:17,765
And the mystery of the inca. Excellent.

121
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:20,165
How yours Ryan? It is

122
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:22,125
from Spain, they said

123
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:23,865
this on this.

124
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,140
Walk where you may, but don't walk through the Andes.

125
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,680
Yeah. And that's a fun one. They get a a really good Spanish pun in there.

126
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,875
And how about you been? I wanna do the German one, but I haven't looked at it yet. So let's see. I'd luck.

127
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:40,315
In

128
00:11:40,695 --> 00:11:41,195
ver

129
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,630
here. In the land of the square eggs,

130
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,490
nice sound. Excellent.

131
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:57,087
Alright. Thank you, guys. And then did you do Chile lane, Colombia? Oh, yeah. I was gonna say Chile Colombia. So in Chile and Colombia, it is just a straight up translation, pedro and.

132
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:58,896
Lost in the andes.

133
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:02,642
I mentioned that I had put out that question on Facebook,

134
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:04,914
what people what the translators

135
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:13,177
how they chose to translate plain awful because it's such a like specific idiom, I think in English. So

136
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:15,308
here are a few of them.

137
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:20,662
In most of the Spanish speaking countries, it was called Quad

138
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,189
which is just square land in

139
00:12:24,565 --> 00:12:27,456
Danish in Denmark. I heard from

140
00:12:28,191 --> 00:12:28,691
Gust

141
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:29,568
Johannes

142
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,815
he told me that it was

143
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:33,945
Raven,

144
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:38,391
which translates directly as like Shabby Raven corner

145
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:40,123
In finland,

146
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:41,362
on

147
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:42,401
Hun

148
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,698
said that it is called

149
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:47,036
Rot.

150
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,290
Which is literally the ultimate Rat hole.

151
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:55,990
Yeah. I like that. And I wanna get that. I wanna get that embroidered then hanging it over my couch.

152
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:01,358
Right as visitors walking in the door. Right? Yes. Exactly.

153
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:08,790
Nice the ultimate one at least. Yes. The ultimate Rat isn't that great. In French, it is

154
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:16,192
set horse, which just means it's awful. And then in German, it's E,

155
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,400
which is just

156
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:28,124
e and, which is just the name of a German city. Alright. And then we'll we'll do a few more of those when we get I think to plain awful.

157
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:33,318
Okay. And then here's a little bit of sort of cultural and geographical

158
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:42,402
context for this story. You know, I think I I read this at least at the beginning. This is clearly a satire of sort of hierarchy

159
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:45,933
and bureaucracy. Right? We have a lot of mocking

160
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:46,892
of

161
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:56,257
bureaucratic levels in this, which is a fun part of it. We mentioned that this one is set in in Peru peru in the And

162
00:13:56,676 --> 00:13:57,176
area.

163
00:13:57,714 --> 00:14:03,382
And I I felt like he he made a point of you know, using the clothing

164
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,935
and kind of depicting the people pretty accurately.

165
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:10,926
You know, I thought it was interesting that he didn't have the classic And

166
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:30,335
know, those classic And caps where it kinda goes down over your ears But yeah. But but apparently, the the song that he showed are also very typical. And they do use those like Au gallo blankets for carrying things. So I thought that was neat. I I could see him referencing Nash Geographic for some of this.

167
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,050
And then we got some of the awesome And

168
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,010
animals

169
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,465
at least referenced. If not shown. We got llama

170
00:14:38,082 --> 00:14:39,140
shown and the v

171
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:40,255
mentioned.

172
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,805
And we've got some of those famous and

173
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:48,425
like rope bridges. That's shown at one point. And then we've got a reference to

174
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:49,605
Bet.

175
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:50,643
You guys...

176
00:14:51,342 --> 00:14:54,214
I'm sure all of you know what that's referenced. Right?

177
00:14:55,193 --> 00:15:01,545
He oh you guys really not not know anything None of us none of us have heard of that except you Mark. Oh I I don't.

178
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:10,690
So what don't... I... Eric seems to. Go on with the wind. Yeah. So it's like a a switched around version

179
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:15,865
of re butler. Right? So it's referencing the character from gone with the wind,

180
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:22,791
you know, classic southern film. In for our notable appearances, of course, and this one we have the plain awful,

181
00:15:23,408 --> 00:15:27,021
the old Vic hunter. What what version of the characters?

182
00:15:27,814 --> 00:15:31,925
Ryan, What what would you say is kind of the version? How would you characterize them in this one?

183
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:36,635
Yeah. They seem I feel like they're kind of back to their clever selves.

184
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:39,786
I think Donald probably a little mean,

185
00:15:40,165 --> 00:15:44,180
than he has been in some other issues, but he's also not the villain

186
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:54,087
Right. Right. Yeah. I I have my notes. I was like, they're very resourceful in this one but Donald is also kind perpetually, like, put out. Right? He's always

187
00:15:54,678 --> 00:15:58,845
annoyed in this one. You guys any any thoughts before we go into

188
00:15:59,301 --> 00:15:59,801
the

189
00:16:00,178 --> 00:16:03,804
content of the story itself? No. I don't think so. Alright. So

190
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:07,640
alright. We're gonna try to be organized about this. We have a lot of people

191
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:17,557
guessing on this one today. But if you have something to to say about a given page. I definitely wanna hear it. So lost in the Andes

192
00:16:18,095 --> 00:16:18,595
opens

193
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:19,552
by

194
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:25,759
showing us Donald that one of his, like, yet another new job. He's working in a museum,

195
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:28,876
and he's clearly at the bottom of the hierarchy.

196
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:32,406
He is the fourth assistant jan or in the museum

197
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,481
and he gets tasked with polishing museum

198
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,100
stones.

199
00:16:36,674 --> 00:16:46,165
He's really excited about this. He turns towards the museum collection of gems. But he he's told that he actually needs to clean a collection of rubble

200
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:48,694
from ancient inc inca ruins.

201
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:55,970
He gru about this and and he hands up living up to the third assistance nickname of butter fingers.

202
00:16:56,824 --> 00:17:10,315
By dropping what seems to be a square stone only to discover that it cracks like an egg. Eric and comments I'm just wondering what a six year old eight would smell like even if it was and Al by

203
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:11,273
shell.

204
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:21,715
Yeah. And and I definitely wonder later on once when someone's gonna consume it. I think we can answer that question safely in sixty years. We're gonna gonna set one aside.

205
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,901
Yes. We'll be like, do you remember back in twenty twenty one?

206
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,735
Oh, yeah. I I already buried a couple in the yard.

207
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:29,990
Excellent.

208
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:39,917
Alright. So on the next page, he discovers that it is in fact a square egg. And he brings it to the attention of the museum leadership.

209
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,890
And and it's a discovery that start the scientific

210
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,850
world. And it creates a stir in in the scientific

211
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:51,185
the financial and the agricultural spheres.

212
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:55,025
And this excitement ends up resulting in an ex

213
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,600
being mounted.

214
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,640
Ryan, do do you mind kind commenting on those, like three different

215
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:10,120
sets of of groups that become interested in the eggs, the the museum people, the the business people and the agricultural

216
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,317
Yeah. Yeah.

217
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:13,289
First group, the

218
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:15,745
the kind of educated elites here,

219
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:22,715
they're all in suits and bow ties, but otherwise, they're kind of like the elite version of the aliens from the most isolated

220
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:24,455
In Star wars.

221
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:30,790
Like, there's one guy here whose head is just just a ball of fluff with two eyeballs in the middle And,

222
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:38,885
yeah, it's a good kind of mad scientist a little bit sort of collection or like the people who judge the nobel prize. And then second, we have

223
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:47,895
these kind of greedy fat cat kind of guys in a little bit different suits. He makes a point of illustrating how much their buttons shine on their shirts. Right.

224
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:50,851
And then in the third group, we have

225
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,858
some some yoke with big adam's apples and

226
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,169
odd facial hair and and straw hats

227
00:18:58,507 --> 00:19:10,245
to show just kind of Al the all the different crowds of people who are just talking about what an interesting thing this is. Yeah. And and I love these panels that are showing, you know, what a stir arnold's accidental

228
00:19:10,705 --> 00:19:14,325
discovery has created because I feel like there's so much, like, commentary

229
00:19:15,065 --> 00:19:17,925
about these different groups packed into these individual

230
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,000
panels, you know, that you can you can pretty easily see Barks

231
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,274
perception of, like, the academic world right? This

232
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:32,520
the these like kind of kind of weirdo who are locked in their ivory tower

233
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,474
And then then the greed of big business

234
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,867
who is just looking to to exploit.

235
00:19:39,205 --> 00:19:43,475
And then, you know, the the kind of plain folks of the the farmers.

236
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:49,615
Yeah anytime you have a new natural resource that's discovered, you know, it impacts all levels of society.

237
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:52,487
Yeah. Yeah. I couldn't I can imagine

238
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:55,484
what would happen in real life. Alright. So

239
00:19:55,943 --> 00:20:00,292
on the next page, this is kind of all about the the x expedition itself.

240
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,170
And

241
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:03,484
we see the hierarchy

242
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:05,279
that we saw in the museum

243
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:11,233
kind of mirror Right? The the expedition is led by professor artifact archives.

244
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,628
Who is

245
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:14,080
craving and omelette.

246
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:17,911
And so he's gonna delegate the task to his assistant,

247
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:26,436
and it just keeps going down the chain of command to Donald who has gotten to become, you know, involved. I assume because of his accidental

248
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:28,714
discovery, they kinda threw him a bone,

249
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:31,910
and they're letting him come along. And

250
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:36,405
he delegates it to assistance four five and six,

251
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:38,825
who are, of course, who we doing in Louie.

252
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,900
Bus chewing bubble gum. And the bubble gum, of course is gonna to become very significant.

253
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:52,308
So they they go to cook the omelette, but they discover that the ship's galley has no eggs

254
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:56,419
and fateful, they decide to swipe a few of the museums

255
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:57,817
square x.

256
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:01,302
And any comments. I'm just kinda curious if

257
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,814
if the professor has a brother named

258
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:09,333
financial documents, mca archives, who works for the Irs or it's an content or something.

259
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:10,371
Perfect.

260
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:13,404
And are dentist the archives. Yeah. It's

261
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:17,250
like little plan words. And I love the grade a house

262
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:20,003
I don't I don't know what that is, but it's making hungry.

263
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:24,708
Great cow. That that would be milk. Right? This is

264
00:21:25,444 --> 00:21:26,480
Barks kiss.

265
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:30,663
In more corn.

266
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:44,505
More car. Yeah. That's what was gonna comment on. He loves just little like identity and it quite sensitive them, you know, with the gray account corn more corn in the very first and the that museum has brought and then more rocks

267
00:21:44,924 --> 00:21:49,099
Oh, yeah. And then here his and the last panel has spam

268
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:50,897
and

269
00:21:51,315 --> 00:22:01,265
just the little things he does and the sides just makes it fact think he's having fun as well. And I think that's what I things it makes us enjoyable. So you can tell it's if something silly because he's been

270
00:22:01,724 --> 00:22:04,538
very silly with her. Yeah. You're right. I was definitely

271
00:22:05,514 --> 00:22:09,086
remiss and not mentioning the great labels on

272
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,813
the first page where the the stones are labeled A rock and another law too.

273
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:25,790
The this whole part part of what makes this such a classic is that it's just loaded with these awesome site gag. I think he was at the top of his side gag game here. And

274
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:34,070
aids, the eggs something to tackle about. Is just a fantastic and fantastic logo and

275
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:50,620
and tagline for the ai and consortium. Yeah... I just noticed the globe that the billionaires have there. Next to them is also egg shapes. I don't know. If not don't know they They always had an egg shaped globe or if they just got one because they're so excited about eggs now. Well, so on their heads.

276
00:22:51,795 --> 00:22:52,635
Oh, yeah.

277
00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:58,350
Oh, yeah. Every every panel in this one is just

278
00:22:58,808 --> 00:23:00,145
So like, art

279
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:01,939
crafted to maximize

280
00:23:03,352 --> 00:23:06,403
the the humor and the irony and the storytelling

281
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:08,735
this one really benefits

282
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:10,415
from multiple

283
00:23:10,915 --> 00:23:18,057
readings. And and I highly recommend that you guys go back can read it a hundred twenty a hundred and thirty times the way that I have.

284
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,901
Alright. So on on page four,

285
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,169
The nephews

286
00:23:24,865 --> 00:23:27,676
discover that the eggs really smell their age

287
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:32,355
and they they make the omelette and they pass it onto to Donald.

288
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:35,963
He again snaps at them to stop blowing bubble gum.

289
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:43,495
And then each of the assistance is subsequently gonna sneak a bite of the omelette kind of in their own

290
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,375
internal monologue. You know, they they kind of reconcile it in their own ways.

291
00:23:49,068 --> 00:23:53,992
On the way up the chain of command. And each assistant finds the tastes questionable,

292
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:56,640
but none of them is really comfortable like,

293
00:23:57,453 --> 00:23:57,953
stopping

294
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:15,784
the the disaster going up the chain of command and saying any Eric any thoughts. I yeah, I I looked for goofy chain of command on here where it's becoming assistant a second and Donald is so proud bring his nephews long. So he can have assistance to order around.

295
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:21,308
It's it's a great... Nope. I let's go up the latter higher than you. Absolutely.

296
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,660
Also,

297
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,640
none of them, like they don't have a good pretense

298
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:33,008
for saying, I think the sound is bad because they they would have to say, I I swiped a bite of as I was carrying it to your office boss.

299
00:24:35,462 --> 00:24:38,335
Right. Just have to act like, they don't know how bad it is.

300
00:24:39,388 --> 00:24:41,763
I know. I I love how this like hierarchy,

301
00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:45,891
this this credit critique of hierarchy is that they've like,

302
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:47,125
been

303
00:24:47,465 --> 00:24:49,445
insulated from both responsibility

304
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:51,045
and context

305
00:24:51,385 --> 00:24:54,905
and and it's what kind of sets this disaster into motion.

306
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,320
Alright. So on to page five,

307
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,180
having gone all the way up the chain of command, the professor

308
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:08,504
ends up eating it and and both he and his immediate assistants are all stricken.

309
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:12,056
And we kind transition to this hilarious

310
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,550
diagnosis by this late forties parody of a doctor.

311
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:18,910
Yeah.

312
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:24,845
Let's see. Whose trying is, I think Ryan, you want you wanna tell us about the diagnosis.

313
00:25:25,465 --> 00:25:29,420
So he has acute potomac patel of the Potomac.

314
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,740
And I think you probably...

315
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,375
I don't know if you read as a silent p or not. I think the only real word there is Home domain. I I don't know.

316
00:25:40,015 --> 00:25:40,515
Know.

317
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:42,315
Tell tell us more.

318
00:25:42,615 --> 00:25:45,270
It is an element in which the gastric Ducktales.

319
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,450
Tie themselves into square nuts.

320
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:55,462
If you if your stomach has been tied into a bow knot or a sheep shank that is completely different illness.

321
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,795
Potomac ketosis Al the square nuts.

322
00:25:58,434 --> 00:25:58,934
So

323
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,254
so you can only trade it with castor oil, I guess. I've never used cast oil for anything.

324
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:08,238
I think I want to. Yeah. I I feel like it's a car thing.

325
00:26:09,492 --> 00:26:10,344
So I mean,

326
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:12,041
you've seen

327
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:18,266
some of the, like, classic golden golden age cartoons, right, Old loo tunes and

328
00:26:18,818 --> 00:26:40,689
This is like one of those cliche things that that little kids are always being given castor oil in those cartoons for what Al them. Feel like mary Happens maybe. Is giving the the Barks kids. Yeah. I think so. And I think it went out of style. I think it's actually potentially really bad for you. So, yeah. The rest of the page, we get them. We got some good

329
00:26:41,026 --> 00:26:44,914
kind of jokes about their travels going through the horse latitude

330
00:26:45,824 --> 00:26:53,645
there's a good pun where they're asked if they want anything to eat and they all respond May as they travel through there. Alright. And on page six,

331
00:26:54,338 --> 00:26:57,646
by the time that they finally reach Peru,

332
00:26:58,363 --> 00:27:04,563
the professor and his immediate systems have completely lost their interest and looking for eggs,

333
00:27:05,522 --> 00:27:09,378
presumably because they've spent so long with with ag sickness.

334
00:27:09,957 --> 00:27:10,457
And

335
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:11,296
Donald

336
00:27:11,635 --> 00:27:14,822
tries to voice it off as well. But

337
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:20,741
as the only adult at the bottom of the chain of command, he is delegated with the task.

338
00:27:21,315 --> 00:27:23,615
Ben any thoughts. Yeah. I just like the...

339
00:27:24,115 --> 00:27:33,870
I mean, you can kinda see... Like, by this point, think I could tell the bubble down was gonna come in Al play later because they you know, i kept bringing up the bubbles popping and, you know, he's a good at, like

340
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:45,144
callbacks and things like that. So just... Yeah. So i I really noticed on this one is I'm like, okay. The bubble gums come up a few times now. And so then from then i'm like, how is that gonna play a part later?

341
00:27:45,522 --> 00:27:46,022
Absolutely.

342
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,710
And in his reflection

343
00:27:48,927 --> 00:28:00,337
He, you know, in an interview, he talked about being happy with his, like, gag riding in this one, how it's kind of builds up. I guess that was like an old rule when he was a Disney

344
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:01,454
cartoon

345
00:28:02,032 --> 00:28:05,086
story border that they really tried to do with those callbacks

346
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:12,900
Yeah. I was just gonna say, I'm impressed that Donald did not get sick of the group of the people who eat me by the omelette

347
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,910
ones like that. So he obviously has a much shorter stomach.

348
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,345
Right. Or at least he recovered quicker.

349
00:28:20,162 --> 00:28:23,155
I think I think Ducktales have a natural higher tolerance for eggs.

350
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,610
Right. Anything you've emerged from, you can handle eating, you know?

351
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,510
Gross. Yeah.

352
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:35,522
Gonna refrain for making the next three jokes.

353
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:40,268
Yeah. We appreciate that. Yeah. No problem. You're Barks.

354
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:44,315
Alright. So on page seven, we're kind of entering a different

355
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:47,521
phase of the story. You know, they've arrived in the Andes.

356
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:59,454
And I like how each of these pages is like a a kind of a self contained little mini episode, right, Leading up to it. So we transition to them high the Andes. They've hired Al llama.

357
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,242
They're they're going around making inquiries of the locals,

358
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,153
looking after the square eggs. But

359
00:29:06,531 --> 00:29:09,796
each page, you know, is gonna see kind of a different

360
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,227
misunderstanding with them on the first page.

361
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:16,029
They get mistaken by a local for being dice. Eric?

362
00:29:16,566 --> 00:29:24,642
Yeah. Great. I I love his animals. I love with llama. I mean, I know it is Al llama, but I can i'm just trying to figure out

363
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:31,277
dimensions in it. So... But how you figure how you talk people, but then he has this just goofy gucci Al lot

364
00:29:31,973 --> 00:29:50,226
they just makes me smile every time I see is It's the happy one I've ever seen. Yeah. I I agree. I love the... Just looking at the llama that kinda cracks me up. I also I feel like comics as a medium have lost something by abandoning the dotted line showing what you're looking at. Right get on this page.

365
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,340
Show

366
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:04,497
what exactly the character is focused on? It's great. It's a great. It's a great mechanic. I agree. And you know, the the locals here, they're kind of a mix of of goofy

367
00:30:04,993 --> 00:30:05,493
and

368
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:07,466
a little bit shady,

369
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:13,495
regular people. There... I don't feel like they're a car at all in this one. I feel like he

370
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:17,131
tried to depict them as kind of three dimensional

371
00:30:17,765 --> 00:30:19,661
Right. So on page eight,

372
00:30:20,078 --> 00:30:24,606
we get a a kind of a probably the goof encounter of the

373
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:28,329
story up until playing awful itself. He's gonna

374
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:36,995
encounter a very wacky man in the middle of one of those high and surges. And the guy is kind of that classic village idiot wearing wings

375
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,675
thinking that he can fly. But

376
00:30:40,015 --> 00:30:45,615
upon learning that Donald is looking for square eggs, he appoint him the new goof guy in the andes.

377
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:52,622
What'd did you think of that Ryan? It was it was okay for a one off gag. Probably didn't merit an entire page for the one guy.

378
00:30:54,115 --> 00:31:01,355
Also, we never see this guy again. So I assume he jumped off the bridge his death. With his fake fake wings on his arms.

379
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:10,951
Right. Yeah. I think this one is this is probably the page that works the least for me. This one takes me out of the the story a little bit.

380
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:19,638
I'm gonna I'm gonna disagree with both of you on that one. I would want... I would read an entire comic book series with this character as the main character.

381
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,809
And I would start a podcast

382
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:25,445
reviewing every single issue.

383
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:27,723
I... This this character

384
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:32,215
body everything that I'm all about and I i I... And I'm not being

385
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:36,855
sarcastic. I I genuinely like this character. Awesome. Yeah. I laundry concept

386
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:49,575
got looking to the weirdest guy keeps on trying to prove it, but keeps up finding people weird than him. I kinda want goofy to show up in one of his issues and goofy being. And I want give me to be like, dude you just kinda chill them man.

387
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,527
Yeah. And you know, he we don't learn

388
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,980
idiots name here, but

389
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,660
but he calls out to his friends,

390
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,514
Pablo Mon and Tu pack, and These are, like definitely,

391
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:28,000
you know, ke or or Inca names. Right? I know that one of the leaders of the Inca Empire was Mon to Barks, I think is his name, so I'm guessing Barks took took the names from that. I have a question. Two. So So there's four people there's... So who's Pablo Uncle quebec who here's the goofy guy. That was four. I think we don't see... Oh, of us. Right?

392
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,080
I'm gonna say that the guy

393
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,120
hosting

394
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,000
a

395
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:33,880
hundred

396
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:34,840
episode.

397
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:39,286
About duck com is probably the goofy sky.

398
00:32:40,979 --> 00:32:45,307
So on page, page nine has the docs next encounter

399
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,671
and it's with a very, like sharp local

400
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:49,748
who

401
00:32:50,205 --> 00:32:53,138
upon learning that the Ducktales are willing to pay fifty

402
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:54,831
pa a dozen.

403
00:32:55,644 --> 00:32:58,338
He very cleverly alerts his village

404
00:32:58,795 --> 00:33:19,248
using smoke signals. And when the Ducktales arrive, there are piles of square eggs conveniently waiting labeled fifty cent tablets a dozen. Now like is little work. He's like, okay. This guy. Got his number. And I'm... I'm I kinda wish they would have translated what he really sent in the smoke signal, like, incoming sucker

405
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:28,045
makes make make one thousand square eggs out of whatever you can find as fast as possible, you know. Right. And and I really like

406
00:33:28,504 --> 00:33:32,113
I like this a lot. Right? Because it it gives them some agency,

407
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:36,298
You know, they've got... They've got this outsider. He's clearly

408
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,930
brandi money about. It kind of invert the whole, like,

409
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,030
exploitation

410
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:52,885
was going on around the world where and that continues too. They're they're gonna do a little bit of exploiting of of their own. It big signals. Where is that what's that was that a thing

411
00:33:53,345 --> 00:33:54,620
and culture.

412
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:01,820
But I wondered about that. I I should checked in on that. If it makes sense to me. Right? That in the Andes

413
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:07,763
where you might be separated not that far as the... As the condo flies,

414
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:19,141
but that it might take, like, a day to go around a mountain you make sense. But... Yeah. I'll have to look that up. I'm gonna be ryan here and sadly really like, the exclamation point the Donald head walking into

415
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:20,596
the ability.

416
00:34:20,896 --> 00:34:31,303
Seem just show surprise that excitement. Yeah. Sometimes my hat goes two feet above my head and I get really shocked too. You know what? I think I think I just came up with my halloween costume.

417
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:33,141
Yeah.

418
00:34:33,835 --> 00:34:37,989
Al hat this two feet up and another two feet Gen exclamation mark. Yeah.

419
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:40,466
Spend by wires or something. Love.

420
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:49,091
Alright. So on page ten, you know, Donald runs in, he's cr looking to buy the whole lot of the eggs

421
00:34:49,405 --> 00:34:50,904
the Nephews are a little bit

422
00:34:51,402 --> 00:34:51,902
less

423
00:34:52,361 --> 00:34:57,336
apt to be sucker. So they go to investigate. They don't they don't see any signs of chickens

424
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:04,263
but they eventually encounter the locals pouring cement in molds to pass them off as eggs

425
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,161
and they warn donald.

426
00:35:06,615 --> 00:35:18,440
Of the scam. But yeah. I pressed the the nephews again solving the problem or, you know, realized that there's a scan going on. I'm also impressed by the fact that they have a electric

427
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,840
cement mixer this high the andes when they actually the

428
00:35:22,235 --> 00:35:27,775
everything in by while. I don't want me to point while i that to bring that that thing up there. It's pretty convenient.

429
00:35:28,195 --> 00:35:31,455
It... It's pretty convenient, but it... It makes for a great.

430
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:38,295
Oh, yeah. No. Though. It's a great day. Got just... And I'll mention too that, you know, that image of Donald brandi

431
00:35:38,912 --> 00:35:49,415
w of cash was used, I think is the cover art for one of the collections of these stories that I got as a kid. So I... To me that picture there is very iconic.

432
00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:56,276
And then I just... I feel like the dialogue is just so tight throughout this, but on on this page, you know, they

433
00:35:56,813 --> 00:35:57,952
we've got a fun

434
00:35:58,385 --> 00:36:02,680
little inversion of the name, you know, Montgomery Ward and Sears

435
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:03,599
Sears,

436
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:09,242
I think are kinda def, but it's call award and rob, cement mixer.

437
00:36:10,057 --> 00:36:11,871
I didn't want us to pass by

438
00:36:12,328 --> 00:36:13,983
Mcdonald's nickname for the llama

439
00:36:14,734 --> 00:36:25,838
without pointing it out, but he he's telling his nephews to stop blowing that bubble and looks back at Llama, who is also now blowing Bubble gum and says, and that goes for you two, Shaggy Slacks

440
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:37,946
rides. And I i you're right. I I neglected to mention that in the summary. And that's a great part, but and and it's a throw a gag, but at the same time, it's this great sort of fore foreshadowing

441
00:36:38,402 --> 00:36:55,292
of the fact that they've you know, they've taught this hap animal to to blow bubble them either it learned by osmosis, or they they taught it. But it... It's a hilarious image too. Alright. And on page eleven, they eventually reach the highest plateau and they seem to run out of people

442
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:05,680
to ask. And so the nephews come convince donald that he's gonna have to resort to breaking the eggs to just prove that it's real. And so he agrees to break one the next time they encounter a human.

443
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:09,515
And many miles later, they finally encounter

444
00:37:09,815 --> 00:37:11,495
an old Vic hunter.

445
00:37:12,015 --> 00:37:12,755
I appreciate

446
00:37:13,135 --> 00:37:21,290
the the effort it takes. As an artist to gradually change the terrain in the background as they're traveling across the continent and they've gone from the gigantic

447
00:37:22,483 --> 00:37:22,983
peaks

448
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:23,941
to

449
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:27,853
kind of some lower lower hills and now

450
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:40,341
here on this page, they're on some kind of high desert sort of thing with some big boulders and stuff and and they're definitely not up Al the, you know, machu picchu altitude anymore. There were a few pages ago.

451
00:37:41,874 --> 00:37:42,374
Everything's

452
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:56,853
lot Al really different color now. And you can tell you get this sense of how far they're really traveling. Yeah. I definitely agree. I think you're right. He he does a really nice job of showing these transitions. Right? On page twelve, Donald

453
00:37:57,392 --> 00:37:58,451
greet the man

454
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:02,445
He's very he's very old. He's very s.

455
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:11,962
And he breaks an egg right right in front of him. But he falls when the man shares that he hasn't been able to see a thing since breaking his glasses.

456
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:36,215
So the nephews used calm donald down, and they asked the old timer that And and I feel like they approach him, you know, in a very, like, conscious wear way, you know? To to feel the egg, And so the old man considers it very carefully. And he realizes that, in fact, he hasn't encountered them a very long time ago. Ben, any thoughts on this one? Just nothing really specific. I like it. I just noticed

457
00:38:36,755 --> 00:38:37,475
in, you know,

458
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,735
comics like this and cartoons

459
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:46,209
you know, people faint Al lot from shock. And I I've never actually seen somebody

460
00:38:46,586 --> 00:39:00,053
faint from seeing something that disturb them and I I hope before I die, then I just see somebody go. Oh, I'm just faint from seeing something that's too overwhelming for them. Someone just heavens to murder troy.

461
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:04,802
Just hope that I'm there to catch them and

462
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:09,524
you know Like is that something that happened more and now we're just so dis

463
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:14,947
because of the Internet that we just don't faint from anything we see. Yeah. I go to the furniture

464
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,069
and they barely have any any faint couches. Eighteen cat.

465
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,262
You I like the gag

466
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:24,351
to setting it up. Okay. We've before we got a few eggs. Right.

467
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:29,719
Cracking it up, and he's just... you know, just s like like a... Yeah see what.

468
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,708
Yeah. That was was good. Alright. So on page thirteen,

469
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:39,641
the old man, the the Vi hunter tells of when he was a little mu chat,

470
00:39:40,134 --> 00:39:42,029
and he encountered a very adult

471
00:39:42,366 --> 00:39:43,583
American on American

472
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,934
near the region of the mists

473
00:39:46,311 --> 00:39:47,688
who had the stones

474
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:54,820
The man died after he came out of them, and the hunter father took the stones to the Pad and Cusco

475
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,520
before they must have ended up in the museum.

476
00:39:58,015 --> 00:40:01,776
And so Donald asks him about this region of the mists.

477
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:05,596
And Eric, i need any thoughts on this one? It's a great

478
00:40:06,336 --> 00:40:09,730
exposition. And getting the story of how the aids

479
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:21,085
got to the Museum and how come no heard of them since Yeah. I agree. This is some nice. This is really just an expo page, but it's done in this nice, like, remembrance.

480
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,937
Story. Yeah. And since it's well drawn,

481
00:40:24,696 --> 00:40:27,693
showing you the shoulders just old the and hunter was.

482
00:40:28,532 --> 00:40:33,992
Just well done I agree I find them very memorable. Alright. So on page fourteen,

483
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:40,866
the the Vic Hunter points out the mist which are not too far away. And he

484
00:40:41,204 --> 00:40:43,700
sets up very nicely how it's this

485
00:40:44,118 --> 00:40:53,769
hidden area where anything could be and shrouded within this deep fog. So the Ducktales. They they get very excited and they set out towards the mists

486
00:40:54,106 --> 00:41:02,531
before the old man is able to warn them. But of course, have got the classic, no one who enters comes back to tell what they saw.

487
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:07,866
And when when the docs do get closer to the miss, they look very ominous

488
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:09,946
and their llama

489
00:41:10,446 --> 00:41:11,466
very wisely

490
00:41:11,766 --> 00:41:13,600
refuses to go any further.

491
00:41:14,258 --> 00:41:18,270
Ryan, any comments. I think I've noticed also the art style,

492
00:41:19,127 --> 00:41:22,396
the V hunter and then the mountains here are

493
00:41:23,253 --> 00:41:26,104
drawn in a little bit of a different way. They don't have the kind of same

494
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,300
bright

495
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:28,655
colors

496
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:30,506
and everything they have more shading.

497
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,453
Yeah. They look a little more like paintings almost than the kind of cartoons

498
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:39,455
that were used to the kind of Disney look, you know. Right. They're very detailed. And

499
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:50,152
and this page has also taught me that when I'm on and unfamiliar continent and someone has told me where to go, and he says wait wait. I'm not going to rush off and just take my llama down to the

500
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,542
to to my doom. I think that's a good policy even if you're on.

501
00:41:55,296 --> 00:42:02,796
Yeah. Yeah. And I'm gonna point out in the lower left panel where you can see the mists that some of them look very ominous

502
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:07,082
like yeah tend or clause reaching out. It looks

503
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:13,876
extremely threatening. My only my only criticism is probably a limitation. This would have been a great

504
00:42:14,455 --> 00:42:19,470
you know, full page or half page panel. And I love the pushing the stubborn

505
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:22,427
llama forward. Right. So on page fifteen,

506
00:42:22,926 --> 00:42:29,335
the Ducktales make camp, and by morning, the mists have rolled in and they're completely surrounded by fog.

507
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:38,664
They get separated briefly and in the process of finding each other. They end up losing sight of their camp. And they're they're quickly

508
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:47,892
completely lost. Got some of the kind of classic foggy art or the artist it's maybe a little bit of a break here. And any comments

509
00:42:48,245 --> 00:43:01,062
Like, how we handle the the... you know, it's a unique challenge, You know, how do you handle that with Silhouette or I thought i handled the art... A style really well And I do feel like he does a good job of kind of conveying how

510
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:20,642
lost and frightened this must feel for them. Yeah. Yeah. Like, like said, I like the the silhouette with the kind of lines matching through it. Right. So on page sixteen, the docs wonder for for hours and they eventually bump into a mysterious wall that they say resembles, those, the ink is built.

511
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:23,031
They feel along it for an opening

512
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:40,183
and they come to a point where a block has fallen out. They crawl through expecting to emerge safely, but instead, they fall through empty space. Eric. Any you comments? I think it's great to expect, you know, we don't know where we're going. But this whole little bit of terror of

513
00:43:40,602 --> 00:43:43,199
when go export I'll sudden shu. He's gone.

514
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:45,756
And man listen to somebody in the dark.

515
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:50,337
You get this sorted really fast enough and lose i've got minutes. That's creepy.

516
00:43:51,032 --> 00:43:53,325
Yeah. Right. On page seventeen,

517
00:43:54,036 --> 00:43:58,925
the Ducktales free fall for a little while, and then they land fairly safely on a grass

518
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:00,482
incline, which slopes

519
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:02,277
down. And they're

520
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:06,657
They're eventually stopped by another wall and they comment on how warm it's gotten.

521
00:44:07,654 --> 00:44:11,282
Peer over the wall, they see a block lost world.

522
00:44:12,095 --> 00:44:13,313
Beneath the fog.

523
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:17,381
And, you know, this is the panel that I was referencing

524
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:18,698
where he

525
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:21,871
he kinda criticized himself for his

526
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:22,871
perspective.

527
00:44:23,371 --> 00:44:23,871
But...

528
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:29,279
But, you know, that's not something that I ever noticed reading it. And and this is one of those

529
00:44:30,015 --> 00:44:32,866
very famous panels and I think is

530
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,624
does a great job of setting the the rest of this story up here.

531
00:44:37,962 --> 00:44:38,640
Ryan any thoughts?

532
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:40,155
Yeah.

533
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:50,280
I like the top half of this page is four panels that are kind of cut out of one one rectangle into interesting shapes. Yeah. It gives

534
00:44:50,657 --> 00:44:54,108
actually kind of a sense of the motion. You can see them falling in the

535
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:59,068
ink blackness on the top and then the panel below that there start to hit the

536
00:44:59,525 --> 00:45:01,359
incline and slide down the down the grass.

537
00:45:02,357 --> 00:45:03,952
Yeah. It feels kind of experimental.

538
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:08,022
Yeah, Al little bit. And then and then having them

539
00:45:08,801 --> 00:45:12,117
arrive in my craft is also a little bit wrong.

540
00:45:13,327 --> 00:45:19,125
Right. Any any kid reading this one today is gonna immediately think of minecraft and

541
00:45:19,876 --> 00:45:21,094
when they see this.

542
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,166
Because it is one of the Nephews used comments,

543
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:27,097
sure is a block look place.

544
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:31,447
Which, you know, is gonna be very press and. Right. So on

545
00:45:31,826 --> 00:45:32,926
page eighteen,

546
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:39,528
the Ducktales observe the place for a little while. And they note that there isn't anything round in the whole area.

547
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:48,157
Donald is convinced that this must be where square eggs come from for the boys caution him to be wary of the potentially savage

548
00:45:48,534 --> 00:45:49,034
inhabitants.

549
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:51,944
And so Donald approaches a little more cautiously.

550
00:45:52,456 --> 00:45:59,757
Then he gets surprised by the boys bubble gum popping again. We've got a little reminder of the the bubble gum going. Ben any comment.

551
00:46:00,731 --> 00:46:04,047
Yeah. So when I saw... I mean, in addition to the Minecraft,

552
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:06,026
my first

553
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:09,702
thought when I started when they start getting into the

554
00:46:10,494 --> 00:46:14,302
you know, how embedded the square of everything is into...

555
00:46:15,435 --> 00:46:20,296
There's a rick and morty episode where they've the land on a corn kong planet.

556
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:21,412
And

557
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:34,438
they look like, oh, yeah. There's corn the cob. This is a perfect... Planet to stay on and they look in the mountains or shaped like corn com and everything, and then he he's like, oh, wait a minute. And he gets a microscope and he looks and everything

558
00:46:35,072 --> 00:46:38,172
a corn cobb even at the atomic level and he just...

559
00:46:38,592 --> 00:46:41,652
Let's get out of here. We Al. There's everything's scored go.

560
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:51,220
And like, when they get sick with the, you know, eating the egg, and it ties their stomach into squares and, you know, that's that's it's just like something in the Dna

561
00:46:51,598 --> 00:46:52,098
of

562
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:55,530
vibration in the in the space. Just it just...

563
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:58,124
It seems like it's more than just

564
00:46:58,836 --> 00:47:06,427
Oh, let's just shape this into the squares. There's... You like that that there's no real explanation for why everything. Yeah.

565
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:15,467
It's it's beyond just like, oh, architectural, we think it just makes sense to do things in squares. Like, there's there's something deeper that they never really get into, but

566
00:47:16,327 --> 00:47:20,347
I've gotta assume it's coming out of those, like, volcanic events that are keeping.

567
00:47:21,487 --> 00:47:21,887
Yeah.

568
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:24,040
So, you know, this page

569
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:47,911
feels weird to me a little bit because when I first read this story, I mentioned that it was in a collection of, like, it was a collection of ten Barks stories, and they excise a few parts of this one. To fit it in. And I'm sure they went for, you know, the parts that weren't totally critical to this story. But this page, most of the panels from this were just cut out.

570
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:48,686
So

571
00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:51,739
it always feels a little bit out of place to me.

572
00:47:52,776 --> 00:47:54,213
So by the next page,

573
00:47:55,051 --> 00:48:08,716
the ducks send cautiously into the city and they hide behind the large Cubic rocks so that they can observe the situation and eventually one of the inhabitants approaches and he shocks the ducks by singing the very famous

574
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:10,036
southern Anthem

575
00:48:10,376 --> 00:48:10,876
dixie.

576
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:14,771
And they're further shocked to see that the person

577
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:15,611
is

578
00:48:16,191 --> 00:48:19,171
very block. He himself is sq

579
00:48:19,765 --> 00:48:21,223
or Qb or whatever.

580
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:28,786
And Donald goes to approach him, at least knowing that they can speak the same language, at least the corn version.

581
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:30,873
Eric.

582
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:34,242
I have four children

583
00:48:34,817 --> 00:48:36,074
and I was involved

584
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:38,082
in all four of their births

585
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:41,950
and the notion of a square headed person being born.

586
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:50,576
Right me for all the women in this society. Oh, yeah. I'm just putting that... I'll square rooms make it a little easier.

587
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:55,573
Sure. I can just... I'm just saying as we you know.

588
00:48:56,189 --> 00:48:58,680
For all we know these guys also hatch from square.

589
00:48:59,575 --> 00:49:01,071
This is true. We don't know.

590
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,916
Shaped like squares, I think they're fine. Just you don't... You just don't wanna have a

591
00:49:06,415 --> 00:49:08,932
a a round in a square together.

592
00:49:10,265 --> 00:49:17,617
It's right. Yeah. There's so much going on in this page. You know? Just... And and then this is one of those things that's very out of time. Right? Like,

593
00:49:18,431 --> 00:49:21,248
Donald and the boys are definitely not southern,

594
00:49:21,787 --> 00:49:22,287
but

595
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:30,745
I think Dixie was one of the most famous songs in the world. At this or in the country, excuse me. Sure. At this time.

596
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:32,920
And, you know, it's very controversial

597
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:43,582
for obvious reasons today, but there's there's none of that and here it's just... This is a song that you would have heard all over the place back then. You guys all know the song Dixie?

598
00:49:44,595 --> 00:49:53,278
No it I think a little bit. I can I they had to to my head of bag don't ask me repeat it. That's fine. I'll I'll go ahead and put it in right here

599
00:49:57,952 --> 00:50:01,952
At least snippet it. But this is you know, the expression West dixie.

600
00:50:02,685 --> 00:50:07,053
Alright. So on the next page, the Ducks introduced themselves and the be

601
00:50:07,391 --> 00:50:11,759
inhabit is shocked to learn that these queer looking folks are from America.

602
00:50:12,192 --> 00:50:13,572
He alerts the rest

603
00:50:13,952 --> 00:50:20,092
and and they excited yell about this being the first time they've had Americans for dinner since eighteen

604
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,505
sixty eight, and the only time.

605
00:50:23,164 --> 00:50:33,932
And then the docs have, of course interpreted this to mean that they are to be the dinner. As they're nervous hustle into the main dining room. I I like... I liked

606
00:50:34,389 --> 00:50:34,889
flipping

607
00:50:35,305 --> 00:50:40,637
one of the oldest strokes of, you know, the aliens arrive and we would like to have you for dinner.

608
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:44,677
And like oh, yeah. That would be great. That sounds great. I would love to have dinner with you guys.

609
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:52,842
And they just are oblivious to what's going on and that these guys who are totally innocent and have never eaten anything in their lives besides square eggs.

610
00:50:54,732 --> 00:51:04,992
Would like to invite their new guests, a new American guests to have some square eggs with them, but these guys are certain. These these weird alien cute people are going to are going to try to eat us. Right.

611
00:51:05,492 --> 00:51:09,252
Right. You know. And they're obviously lee. They've they've wondered if they're savage.

612
00:51:09,905 --> 00:51:12,241
And we're getting just this really quick

613
00:51:12,818 --> 00:51:20,990
introduction to what we're about to learn is is playing awful. You know. We we learn very quickly that the inhabitants are these very cheerful

614
00:51:21,925 --> 00:51:31,487
optimistic friendly people. I think it's it's really interesting. This is a big part of why the story stands out so much is that this is a very unusual

615
00:51:32,023 --> 00:51:33,612
group for these like loss

616
00:51:34,232 --> 00:51:37,732
civilization. Stories were most of the time they are hostile. And

617
00:51:38,632 --> 00:51:41,692
yeah. And I just love the the brief passage

618
00:51:42,286 --> 00:51:50,488
through their city, you know, and the the architecture that we see and the taste of it that we get. Alright. And on page twenty one,

619
00:51:50,881 --> 00:51:54,211
the president of this place informs them

620
00:51:54,548 --> 00:51:58,077
that they are just showing them some good old southern

621
00:51:58,614 --> 00:51:58,932
hospitality.

622
00:51:59,706 --> 00:52:01,624
That they don't need to worry about being eaten.

623
00:52:02,303 --> 00:52:09,966
Well Donald asks them questions about their knowledge of America and how they know English, the Nephews focus on the banquet,

624
00:52:10,903 --> 00:52:13,418
which the first course is poached eggs.

625
00:52:14,016 --> 00:52:21,447
Then the president explains they learned English from their only other visitor, professor Rut Bet from the Bum

626
00:52:22,187 --> 00:52:22,927
where Birmingham

627
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:32,554
school of English. And then we see the second course is scrambled eggs. Ben any comments I mean, technically, they are more southern than we are. So, I mean,

628
00:52:33,393 --> 00:52:44,151
have to have it right. And and it's interesting that we never really, like, kind of acknowledge the fact that, you know, the ducks have these very round face. And so there's that

629
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:50,023
inconsistency. Right? You. But we just have to kind of... They accept

630
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:57,281
the American culture, you know, they they gave some allowances for it. Right. Ryan did you have something?

631
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:07,137
Yeah. I didn't catch on the first reading how Ironic it is that the only other guy, the guy who taught them to talk this way is a professor from the school of English and and

632
00:53:07,515 --> 00:53:11,784
he he talks like he's getting some shrimp in the by you.

633
00:53:12,603 --> 00:53:21,878
And I would guess that this is kind of supposed to be that very deep south. He's from Bum and. Right? So... Yep. So it's it's meant to be

634
00:53:22,316 --> 00:53:30,065
Alabama, but you could read it as Georgia. We're we're really supposed to evo that, like, reconstruction era. What do you think, Eric?

635
00:53:30,783 --> 00:53:37,516
I'd love... I I love this and I love the continued reference of the map having this extremely

636
00:53:37,972 --> 00:53:38,472
extremely

637
00:53:38,888 --> 00:53:41,196
very Al use spring

638
00:53:41,574 --> 00:53:43,151
with wild rice dressing.

639
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:45,625
What

640
00:53:46,402 --> 00:53:51,609
That's what they're initially hoping to get. Yeah. And like, in so of the comments, he used these Huey,,

641
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:58,482
these nephews just, like, well, what I'm hoping for mean, was it was last from watched third or something where we went to the bear.

642
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:20,272
Fair mountain. And they expect all this nice food they get like, i'll day. I I just love it so much. Eric, this this issue didn't remind you of the of the the way your mom used to cook spring between for you all the time when you were growing up. Okay. Sadly no. We had work the the the autumn, very definitely to meet in the different season of the year. That makes sense.

643
00:54:20,731 --> 00:54:29,626
Alright. So on page twenty two, the conversation continues and I love this kind of parallel track with Donald getting information and the Nephews is just focusing

644
00:54:30,122 --> 00:54:30,880
on the food.

645
00:54:31,796 --> 00:54:38,101
And and they confirmed that the professor was in fact the Dying man who had encountered the vic hunter.

646
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,271
The third course, boiled eggs comes along with the

647
00:54:42,649 --> 00:54:45,082
confirmation that the eggs are the national dish.

648
00:54:45,840 --> 00:55:03,084
So after the banquet with the Ducktales look for an alternative meal, and they find a diner, but they are dismay to learn that there is nothing to eat, but eggs many, many ways. Yeah. I I just worry about the diet of these people with all their eating eggs. I mean, I really worry.

649
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:15,187
Yeah. And No Vegetables and fright. And I think Don rose kinda gonna touch on that in his sequel where he like very specifically calls the eggs out as being super mineral rich.

650
00:55:15,842 --> 00:55:17,582
Etcetera. What do you think, Ryan?

651
00:55:17,922 --> 00:55:19,222
I think this is the...

652
00:55:19,722 --> 00:55:20,542
This is Disney's

653
00:55:20,922 --> 00:55:22,677
predecessor to the Gladstone diet

654
00:55:24,252 --> 00:55:25,031
Twelve thousand.

655
00:55:25,966 --> 00:55:34,061
Until you're roughly the size of the march. That's right. And you know... But you know what, Ryan aren't most Barks kind of sq in shape.

656
00:55:34,482 --> 00:55:35,262
Oh, man.

657
00:55:35,722 --> 00:55:37,222
I'll all come together.

658
00:55:38,641 --> 00:55:47,780
Yeah. I just love the pacing on this too. Just the the cut to the president saying well, to begin with, they is on national dish.

659
00:55:48,158 --> 00:55:58,832
So on on page twenty three, you know, upon learning that it's only eggs to eat. The Ducktales are puzzling at this. Obviously wondering about the absence of of chicken.

660
00:55:59,405 --> 00:56:06,049
But the cook has no idea what they are talking about. And and he reveals that the professor from Bum

661
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:08,180
had the same frustrating

662
00:56:08,759 --> 00:56:16,347
exchange with them. And I I gotta stop in the middle of this page. The the exchange that Donald has with the

663
00:56:16,885 --> 00:56:29,559
diner cook where he jumps up on the counter after the guy asks, what is chickens and he just yells chickens is the guys that lays these eggs. I think this is one of Barks funniest exchanges

664
00:56:30,016 --> 00:56:40,471
ever, because he goes trying to say that's what the professor from Bum used to Al. Ain't nobody ever seen one. I love this moment so much. I noticed the ducks once again

665
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:47,714
that when he tells them nobody's ever seen a chicken, they all get the papers again. Al all backwards off there they're too.

666
00:56:48,212 --> 00:56:55,712
Right. And just a pretty hard looking surface to land. It is. You have all the all the faint couches in country made out of square granite. So.

667
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:59,384
And and on the way out of the diner, you know, one of the villagers

668
00:56:59,722 --> 00:57:02,258
innocently Barks if there's been any new songs

669
00:57:02,651 --> 00:57:04,869
coming out in America since Dixie,

670
00:57:05,328 --> 00:57:09,264
and Donald just very sn says, yes. Chico.

671
00:57:10,976 --> 00:57:18,912
And I think that was a contemporary song that, like, was actually about a chicken. So that's appropriate. They live the chicken who would say.

672
00:57:22,434 --> 00:57:22,934
All.

673
00:57:24,943 --> 00:57:27,515
So that shit got sick and tired of just

674
00:57:27,867 --> 00:57:31,847
jacob. So one morning he started to say

675
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:43,262
Again, I'll I'll probably put a moment Al link here. I I I could tell there was some kind of joke or something in that last

676
00:57:43,962 --> 00:57:45,514
frame I wasn't getting

677
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:53,227
whether it was a song done loose making up or whether it's actually something that's popular in the Us at this time of the comic.

678
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,267
Or at least or at least in the last sixty years around long it's been since these guys are dixie.

679
00:57:58,944 --> 00:58:05,445
Yeah. And I I think I'm not sure, but I think the joke is that it's kind of like us throw away of obnoxious,

680
00:58:06,143 --> 00:58:12,477
you know, songs. Not like, it's not a serious song even apart from being about a chicken obviously.

681
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:19,862
So it's like us us saying, yes, Rebecca Black, Friday, this right. This is the new song that we're all into now, enjoy.

682
00:58:21,076 --> 00:58:22,776
Old time Road. Yeah.

683
00:58:24,636 --> 00:58:30,952
Alright. So on page twenty four, the Ducktales are pondering the situation. And then the next morning,

684
00:58:31,532 --> 00:58:33,311
they ask a lady where

685
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:44,227
where the eggs that they're getting come from and she directs them to aid Valley through a pass in the distance. And there they see a bunch of square rocks but no signs of chickens.

686
00:58:45,065 --> 00:58:54,413
Impressed by the dedication to square clothes these people have and just how Nope. It's gotta be square. Yeah put square test on. Yeah.

687
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:56,068
Where little hands.

688
00:58:56,485 --> 00:59:07,302
I assume made entirely of eggs. Oh, or granite. That sometimes who the resource they had. It was half expecting to see a philosopher just saying, oh, the egg clearly came first.

689
00:59:09,236 --> 00:59:11,016
Yeah. That does seem like a

690
00:59:11,796 --> 00:59:13,836
a a missed opportunity for.

691
00:59:14,196 --> 00:59:16,636
Alright. So on the next page twenty five,

692
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:26,552
Donald goes up to explore the cliffs while the nephew stay in this valley to investigate. And in the process of blowing their bubble gum and attaching around bubble,

693
00:59:27,365 --> 00:59:37,021
Huey, dewey and Louis inadvertently discover that the rocks in the valley are actually the civilizations missing chickens all folded up. And the chickens are just

694
00:59:37,361 --> 00:59:41,861
enraged by the bubble. Which really should be a clue, but the boys

695
00:59:42,401 --> 00:59:44,135
some and uncle donald. Eric.

696
00:59:44,654 --> 00:59:47,429
Just how much gum did these boys pack?

697
00:59:48,327 --> 00:59:52,758
I mean I know they've got limited amounts of their the their hats and pockets, but, like,

698
00:59:53,571 --> 00:59:54,310
so much.

699
00:59:55,005 --> 01:00:02,195
I'm impressed. And the old days man, you could make... You could make one piece of gum last forever. You just chew that same piece of gum for a month Right.

700
01:00:02,754 --> 01:00:06,607
Stick it under hat when you're not chewing it taking that later. Also,

701
01:00:07,184 --> 01:00:09,161
I like that the chickens are apparently

702
01:00:09,579 --> 01:00:10,558
has transformers.

703
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:18,403
Because they cracked like a an ordinary square block. But then all of a sudden they have, like, a red, you know, rooster comb and and

704
01:00:19,554 --> 01:00:20,232
Ducktales

705
01:00:20,391 --> 01:00:22,008
and everything they they completely.

706
01:00:23,341 --> 01:00:27,607
Well now I wanna make a minecraft skin to re res the chickens to look like this.

707
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,718
Yes. Oh, yeah.

708
01:00:30,056 --> 01:00:34,946
Yeah. And I love this page. I love this development in the story. This is such an audacious

709
01:00:35,364 --> 01:00:36,522
like plot development.

710
01:00:37,016 --> 01:00:41,484
I love the character designer the animal design as well on these chickens and rooster.

711
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:49,836
And so on page twenty six, we cut to a celebration. We transition to the Ducktales being herald for their discovery,

712
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:55,977
which makes them all time heroes of what they come to learn is called plain awful,

713
01:00:56,437 --> 01:00:59,057
which is what the the professor from Bum

714
01:00:59,677 --> 01:01:00,496
dubbed it.

715
01:01:01,276 --> 01:01:02,577
And and they get made

716
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:03,670
the secretaries

717
01:01:04,086 --> 01:01:05,383
of agriculture.

718
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:15,845
You know what? Before I forget, I do wanna take a quick moment to mention i'm stop the podcast dead and its tracks and and mention just a few more of those

719
01:01:16,463 --> 01:01:18,598
global names for plain awful.

720
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:24,751
I I I love the name of the the civilization. It's one of the best gag to me.

721
01:01:25,128 --> 01:01:26,624
So in Italy,

722
01:01:27,296 --> 01:01:34,677
they named this one Tesla quad, which is something like square head. It was jam hao,

723
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:39,364
who shared that in norway,

724
01:01:39,822 --> 01:01:45,686
it was called. So the name of the story was actually Ego miss dead,

725
01:01:46,143 --> 01:01:47,361
so the egg mystery.

726
01:01:48,017 --> 01:01:50,511
Okay. So in Norway, it was called Gu

727
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,637
so it's something like a cold place.

728
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,102
And this was shared to me by.

729
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:02,049
In greece, the city is called

730
01:02:02,745 --> 01:02:03,245
Mono

731
01:02:04,116 --> 01:02:05,734
or Mono from

732
01:02:06,072 --> 01:02:06,572
nico

733
01:02:08,108 --> 01:02:15,729
And then in Netherlands, they call it do Al, which means something like a dull misery from early

734
01:02:16,148 --> 01:02:16,648
leaf.

735
01:02:17,227 --> 01:02:18,646
And then in Indonesia,

736
01:02:19,344 --> 01:02:20,963
listener Ari Factory.

737
01:02:21,676 --> 01:02:26,207
Told me that it's negative U, which loosely translates to the country of villagers.

738
01:02:26,585 --> 01:02:33,372
And then finally, valued listener Pierre Son tells us that in Swedish, it is called

739
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:34,872
Av viral.

740
01:02:35,432 --> 01:02:48,187
And the literal meaning is world of disgust or disgusting world. And he lets us know that it's also a fun word play in Swedish. That means something like ab, to test or awful.

741
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,499
Alright. So

742
01:02:50,035 --> 01:03:01,236
thank you listeners and hosts for ind me, but I was really interested. How they treated that around the world. Alright. So immediately after they get made the secretaries of agriculture, the nephews

743
01:03:01,814 --> 01:03:06,322
demonstrate the bubble blowing feet that did flush out those chickens. And the plane

744
01:03:06,982 --> 01:03:07,602
are a.

745
01:03:08,462 --> 01:03:08,962
And,

746
01:03:09,422 --> 01:03:12,297
you know, it turns out that they have violated plane awful

747
01:03:12,675 --> 01:03:20,687
one and only law that says however produces a round object must spend the rest of his life in the dreaded stone q.

748
01:03:21,502 --> 01:03:22,282
But the president

749
01:03:22,622 --> 01:03:27,002
suspend their sentence for five days in consideration of their service.

750
01:03:27,382 --> 01:03:37,447
Alright, Ryan, my second reading, this reminds me of and I can't remember which specific comics it is now. But this is the second or maybe third time that a strange lost civilization

751
01:03:37,922 --> 01:03:40,342
has condemned them to be executed

752
01:03:40,682 --> 01:03:41,182
or

753
01:03:41,922 --> 01:03:50,350
imprisoned or come back to the death or something like that based on having broken end up your law. Right? What am I looking?

754
01:03:50,768 --> 01:03:54,818
We had the measles in mystery of the swamp sentence.

755
01:03:55,691 --> 01:04:09,219
Donald to that goofy game of theirs. And I think that's the only other lost civilization one we've had so far. And oh and I'm also thinking of when Donald was made like the the ruler of something,

756
01:04:09,795 --> 01:04:12,010
but the... Oh, yeah. In the

757
01:04:12,921 --> 01:04:17,247
Mah Donald. Yes. And they have that obscured. Yeah. They they

758
01:04:17,624 --> 01:04:31,402
turn him into the the Tiger arena. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's probably what I'm thinking of. Right. It feels like it feels like even though it's a completely different event, it feels like the same kind of kind of a most a weird sentencing.

759
01:04:31,942 --> 01:04:35,962
Yeah. Yeah. Of, you know, nobody could have expected this bizarre

760
01:04:36,596 --> 01:04:45,292
you know, that any some random behavior would be fatal or in this case, you know, sentence to mind in the minds forever. Right.

761
01:04:45,992 --> 01:04:51,612
I i the question too in the plain tony printing of this comic book, that they blur out those bubbles

762
01:04:52,644 --> 01:04:56,854
No. That's a good guy they're all censored. It's pixel pixelated sense

763
01:04:57,192 --> 01:04:59,027
big enough pixels, then it's all squared anyway.

764
01:05:00,201 --> 01:05:15,227
On a on a side note, I was watching a Tv show called reservation dogs and there's a scene where there's, like, eyes and they they blur out the allies because in Native American culture apparently, there's some reason i thought it was kinda Al it's fascinating.

765
01:05:15,607 --> 01:05:19,914
That's awesome that they they, you know, respected that. On page

766
01:05:20,411 --> 01:05:21,349
twenty seven

767
01:05:21,687 --> 01:05:22,187
Donald

768
01:05:22,684 --> 01:05:30,547
asks what what they can do, what the kids can do to redeem themselves. The president dramatically reveals that on the day of judgment,

769
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:37,282
they must stand before the multitude on the grand alter stone of the succulent egg and glow

770
01:05:37,662 --> 01:05:38,502
square bubbles.

771
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:44,057
And and the kids are dis dismay, of course they have five days to learn and,

772
01:05:44,437 --> 01:05:47,617
you know, we we had to see their first couple of days.

773
01:05:48,357 --> 01:05:51,597
It's not going well their efforts to learn to blow square bubbles.

774
01:05:52,131 --> 01:06:03,887
And time and Bubble gum are in short supply. I I love the very dramatic flourish, you know, of their sentence. I I love the pacing on this page. Any thoughts, Eric?

775
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:15,593
I'd love the idea of having to blow where square bubbles and, like, they're unwilling everybody with these bubbles is finally come to get them in the end, even though it was because of the bubbles

776
01:06:15,906 --> 01:06:19,159
they found the chickens. Right now, it's like, this is

777
01:06:19,656 --> 01:06:26,117
a cartoon about blowing bubbles. Right. It it both it's gonna get them into and out of trouble.

778
01:06:26,894 --> 01:06:28,631
And I guess there must be a little

779
01:06:29,288 --> 01:06:47,917
me... Is that musical notation on the bottom right of this page. Is that like a a flat note? That is Al flat. Yes. Okay. Alright. Turns a fun gag if you because the no bread twists is the one you kind of that igloo blue one that's kinda flat also the pops and gives Al flat though. Right. So that's a clever gag for people who are more musically

780
01:06:48,577 --> 01:06:50,317
inclined than I am. What else

781
01:06:50,657 --> 01:06:51,157
I...

782
01:06:51,457 --> 01:06:58,083
You know, it it occurred to me to wonder if it was possible to blow a square bubble, so I googled it, and

783
01:06:58,501 --> 01:07:09,632
no one's done it with bubble gum that I'm aware of. But I saw one of those like, sort of mister wizard or, you know, there was the science kids science entertainer who built like this

784
01:07:10,051 --> 01:07:13,788
special cubic frame with kind of suspended

785
01:07:14,486 --> 01:07:25,788
suspended frame inside. And apparently using that is possible to blow a square bubble with soap sides. It's it's well worth taking a look on Youtube. It's probably a Youtuber that my kids watch frequently.

786
01:07:26,361 --> 01:07:26,861
Right.

787
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:34,792
Alright. So on page twenty eight, we see the... Meanwhile. The citizens of playing awful will have gone chicken and crazy.

788
01:07:35,286 --> 01:07:53,615
They're tending their newfound chickens. We get a a gag with one man bragging about his prospective regulators. All same cock doodle do. Again, it's a cute gag that's also gonna be a nice foreshadowing. And then the nephews are taking a little break. They find some newly hatched very cute chips.

789
01:07:53,994 --> 01:07:59,027
But Donald snaps at them to get back to blowing. And let's see. Ryan, any thoughts?

790
01:08:00,797 --> 01:08:03,948
I think we should point out the way they're trying to...

791
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:09,074
These people who have never encountered an animal lower on the food chain than them before and

792
01:08:09,826 --> 01:08:14,155
So one guy has boiled this bird thirty six hours, and he's still telling.

793
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:32,210
Right. Yeah. I I love it. Everyone knows. You don't boil meat for more than twenty, twenty five hours management right. Right. I also imagine that the chickens, you know, are just based on the fact that they're very rock like, they're probably already really tough. That's probably true. Right? So on twenty nine,

794
01:08:32,562 --> 01:08:43,688
we transition to their judgment day where the Nephews and the president who who... You know, he's really he's rooting for them. He's just... I think he feels like his hands are tied. They're both very anxious.

795
01:08:44,427 --> 01:08:47,008
And then the the comic sort of camera

796
01:08:47,387 --> 01:09:00,453
perspective rises above the fog line And then incredibly, when we see the nephews, they're doing it. They're blowing the square eggs. Everyone's excited and cheering. And then when the tunnel and shouting dies down, Donald

797
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:06,319
privately asked them how that they how they did it? And they reveal that they secretly

798
01:09:06,672 --> 01:09:10,925
trained those baby chicks to blow bubbles from inside their shirts.

799
01:09:11,423 --> 01:09:18,283
And and I I love the resolution here. I love how it's been set up so masterfully.

800
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:23,306
I love how clever it is. I I just... I love everything about this

801
01:09:23,843 --> 01:09:24,082
page.

802
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,220
But

803
01:09:25,731 --> 01:09:34,863
Maybe not everyone does. Ben? Yeah. I liked it, you know, the I his optimism how he's rooting for them to blow the squares also known as Square rooting.

804
01:09:38,318 --> 01:09:41,898
Maybe that's where the origin of the work came from. I'm sure it is.

805
01:09:42,997 --> 01:09:43,898
Right. The nature

806
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:44,758
term.

807
01:09:46,528 --> 01:09:49,500
Kudos. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Well, well done then.

808
01:09:50,714 --> 01:09:51,693
Alright. So

809
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:54,298
you know, we've we've gotten the big resolution

810
01:09:54,875 --> 01:10:15,861
but on page thirty, you know, we still have a big problem kind of outstanding. They're they're saved, but the Ducktales still trapped and plain awful because they don't have any way to safely get through that fog with the load of chickens and eggs they anticipate having. And while Donald ponder the situation, the Nephews check inside a building that turns out to be the local museum.

811
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,273
And they they date their artifacts from

812
01:10:19,653 --> 01:10:20,832
Bp b

813
01:10:21,452 --> 01:10:23,432
before the professor from Bum

814
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:34,028
and and they encounter a magic Huey, gizmo on display made of brass given by the professor. And on closer examination, they're delighted to discover that it is a compass.

815
01:10:34,644 --> 01:10:36,752
Eric. The throw comment

816
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:40,229
what do these guys have that's worth saving is

817
01:10:40,568 --> 01:10:41,048
fantastic.

818
01:10:42,326 --> 01:10:42,826
To

819
01:10:43,206 --> 01:10:43,706
that's.

820
01:10:45,204 --> 01:10:54,948
Like it's rocks and Barks, and aids. That's it. There's nothing here. Right. Because the only other thing they have to display that we see is, like an ancient egg.

821
01:10:56,021 --> 01:11:00,032
Alright. So on page thirty one, the president

822
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:07,473
agrees that they will part with the compass if the Ducktales can teach the citizens something to improve their good spirit.

823
01:11:08,212 --> 01:11:10,271
You know, which is just a nice little

824
01:11:11,049 --> 01:11:18,042
illustration again of how how warm and positive if naive these the plain Al are.

825
01:11:18,582 --> 01:11:22,502
So the Nephews cleverly volunteer to teach them square dancing.

826
01:11:22,956 --> 01:11:26,925
Which is the last thing that we can hear the last trace of plane awful

827
01:11:27,542 --> 01:11:41,025
as they journey from out of the valley. And then we transition to days later where the Ducktales finally make it through the fog and they stagger out into the sun. And there's a nice moment where they kinda sit and reflect on how the plane

828
01:11:41,683 --> 01:11:43,620
have never even seen the sun,

829
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:47,532
but they receive warmth from those volcanoes that we see

830
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:59,993
and from their kind heart, which, you know, it's it's sac, but we we see it. So I feel like it's very organic and nice. And then the Ducktales take stock of what's left of their cargo, and it's just two chickens.

831
01:12:00,888 --> 01:12:03,063
And so they celebrate the expedition

832
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:13,933
success Thanks to as Donald points out his brains and the Nephews used pipe pipe in a few lines of bubble gum. Ryan, and their backpacks are of course cube cuba.

833
01:12:14,806 --> 01:12:28,366
Because they didn't have any stuff left. That all stuff was on the llama that wouldn't go down the into the fog. So they had to I guess pick up some backpacks from their new hosts here. Right. What else could it be? I'm surprised that they didn't bring more

834
01:12:28,983 --> 01:12:37,462
stuff when they've discovered a lost civilization that's really hard to find. You know, I mean, one of the nephews carrying a backpack, why don't have why not have all three nephews that get Barks.

835
01:12:37,982 --> 01:12:42,437
Right. It would've have fit nicely. It would stick nicely in their bag too everything exactly.

836
01:12:42,976 --> 01:13:05,412
Square. Right. Yeah. Yeah. You just put in, you know, twenty five eggs five hundred and twenty five eggs. However they fit. Well, they do having to... They do reference having to eat all the eggs. Right? I I get the impression that their journey through the fog as is pretty long. And then and then we've seen from the museum, but there aren't really any other artifacts that they can bring from plain awful because they don't seem to have anything else.

837
01:13:06,026 --> 01:13:11,868
That's true. You could bring some of those perfectly square loin cloth that everybody wears down there. Right.

838
01:13:12,565 --> 01:13:16,389
And you know what for the first, like, six to eight years

839
01:13:17,045 --> 01:13:23,804
of my reading this story and that original this is actually where the story ended on this kind of reflective

840
01:13:24,436 --> 01:13:41,335
panel on the second to last page because the last page was one of the ones that this publication chose to to leave out. So don't was this very funny cap at the end. As on page thirty two, they get back to Duck.

841
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:48,313
And Donald delivers the chickens to the group of researchers that that examine them in amazement.

842
01:13:48,713 --> 01:13:55,609
And they're they're very excited they're like, we can use this pair to breed a new race of super poultry. And just then one of the...

843
01:13:55,986 --> 01:13:59,647
One of the chickens rev up to Crow, but to everyone's

844
01:14:00,344 --> 01:14:04,152
Dismay, they both crow and they turn out to both be rooster.

845
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:07,100
And so the ducks leave Huey, humiliation

846
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:19,157
They go to a diner where the pork cook makes the mistake of offering them a choice of ham and eggs, a cheese omelette or roast chicken. And we get a nice comic sting. It's one of those calling all cars.

847
01:14:19,637 --> 01:14:25,792
It informs us that an angry duck is wrecking a certain dining car. And that That is how plain awful

848
01:14:26,252 --> 01:14:31,008
or the story lost in the Andes ends. Ben do you have any comments on that last

849
01:14:31,626 --> 01:14:40,660
page there? I mean it's Disney, so they should just look for the presence of a pink bow on one of the one of the chickens. But right. Yeah. And I like that, you know, he establishes

850
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:45,717
earlier on that they all do seem to look the same. What did you think Ryan?

851
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:52,417
To ben's point, you could also look for longer eyelashes. Because anything that's female has long eyelashes.

852
01:14:52,798 --> 01:14:55,537
Right. But I I do feel like this is also

853
01:14:55,957 --> 01:15:10,998
like a wrap up of... I think three times, Donald says, if ex, then I going to start a war. And he he's just... He's just ready to blow up on somebody. He knows he's about to he never quite does until the end when the guy offers him some some eggs and

854
01:15:11,336 --> 01:15:14,249
and he's like, you know what this is it. It's time for me to tear this place.

855
01:15:15,022 --> 01:15:17,762
True. Yeah. It's an it's another of those great callbacks.

856
01:15:18,302 --> 01:15:24,850
So we we've got all these nice layers of callback and gag and I just feel like they come to fruition

857
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:29,954
so nicely at the end of this one. So you know, I have already

858
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:38,662
kept my my hat that I just love this story. This is in, you know, the handful of my very favorite Barks stories.

859
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:47,147
I have read this just just so many times, and I could probably sit down and happily read it every month or so.

860
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,656
It's been a bedtime story

861
01:15:50,232 --> 01:16:00,487
to my to my oldest kids. It's one of the few Barks stories that I've read to to both of them. Twice now and my youngest I'm sure I'll get to before too long.

862
01:16:00,987 --> 01:16:02,367
So so I absolutely

863
01:16:02,747 --> 01:16:04,340
love this one. And

864
01:16:05,277 --> 01:16:08,469
I have maybe some very minor criticisms around the edge,

865
01:16:08,988 --> 01:16:14,350
but I I think that this is as close to a perfect Barks story as it gets.

866
01:16:14,828 --> 01:16:17,244
I'm gonna let's go in that same order.

867
01:16:17,742 --> 01:16:24,406
Eric, I know that you mentioned you love it. You you told us a little bit about it. But any other reflections on

868
01:16:24,905 --> 01:16:32,838
your thoughts? Where does this stack? Would you would you consider this one a favorite? Are there stories that you've enjoyed more? I think it's a favorite.

869
01:16:33,175 --> 01:16:33,675
Absolutely.

870
01:16:34,012 --> 01:16:41,522
Just to creativity Al all. Of Al lost civilization Andes. Who is bloodthirsty bursting or crazy? They're just nice simple,

871
01:16:41,902 --> 01:17:02,436
and it's the advanced the advanced the know side the come in I think the place awful, but the news are happy content. Yeah. So it's it's the outsiders says say, let's sucks. Well, you know, that's that's your opinion. But they happy to them this is places great we love it. And the other notice is these square chickens are absolutely

872
01:17:03,295 --> 01:17:03,795
adorable.

873
01:17:04,134 --> 01:17:08,350
Yeah. I love the look of them so cartoony and so imaginative.

874
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:16,955
I think they're one of the creations I've seen know he has fun paying out of different... you know, with creatures here in there. They're absolutely or with their q.

875
01:17:17,614 --> 01:17:39,372
Yeah. I love them post. Made mid crow, you know, at the same time on the last page. It's it's great. And and the check versions of them are really cute too. And that's a good point you made to, you know, the contrast, like at the beginning with the academic and the business people and the agricultural people. Everyone's like in this sort of rat race mindset.

876
01:17:40,028 --> 01:18:00,117
You know? And and then the the plane off, they're very simple, but they're obvious Al. Just just exceedingly happy with their Al lot in life. I mean, who i under heard the freight tales of the lost Utopia me in the mountains. You and with me go plug over they're offline piece and i you know, be perfect and great. That's true. They found one, but it's great for those people

877
01:18:00,511 --> 01:18:02,449
not for you. Yeah. You're

878
01:18:02,828 --> 01:18:07,802
referring to the classic, like, S law of of lost horizon. And this is

879
01:18:08,437 --> 01:18:12,617
the best example so far of them finding one up until

880
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:14,697
up until a story

881
01:18:15,812 --> 01:18:26,407
several dozen issues from now, which will directly parody that. Another another all time great. That will we'll have Fun getting to. What about you, Ryan? What are your

882
01:18:26,787 --> 01:18:31,487
thoughts on this one? It it sounds like this one wasn't

883
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:36,009
as much of a favorite for you, which which is fine, you know, different opinions

884
01:18:36,904 --> 01:18:39,813
all around. How do you think it's stacked up to the other as you've read?

885
01:18:40,545 --> 01:18:42,718
I think I think it is one of the best ones.

886
01:18:43,494 --> 01:18:44,392
Right on. I

887
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:47,580
I like to ghost to the g more where their

888
01:18:48,171 --> 01:18:51,818
they meet the the night and the sunken ship. Yeah. Everything.

889
01:18:52,235 --> 01:18:55,165
I think that was a really tight story. And and

890
01:18:55,676 --> 01:18:56,735
I like some

891
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:57,732
some

892
01:18:58,748 --> 01:19:02,977
Alaskan survival. Was that frozen gold? Yeah. Yeah. Frozen gold. Yeah. Yeah.

893
01:19:03,712 --> 01:19:07,892
But this is... I think this is up there. I'm I'm noticing now on the second reading.

894
01:19:08,432 --> 01:19:11,312
If you look at the second page, there's... When they show the ship,

895
01:19:12,005 --> 01:19:23,088
after we look at the professors and then the building billionaires on Wall Street and then the yoke on their farm talking about the chickens. The next frame is the the ship that they're leaving on. And in the foreground, you can see

896
01:19:23,665 --> 01:19:36,910
it looks like a fish eat... I want to eat a smaller fish and then a seagull coming down to eat that fish. And then if you go to the very last page here, the very first frame is the ship returning to America and you see the fish eating the bird. It is

897
01:19:37,288 --> 01:19:37,788
getting

898
01:19:38,461 --> 01:19:39,600
revenge for the fish.

899
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:41,318
No.

900
01:19:41,656 --> 01:19:45,052
That's phenomenal. I I never caught that in all those readings.

901
01:19:45,586 --> 01:19:55,159
Partially because it's on that last page that I didn't read as many times. Yeah. I just gone. I was just looking at this page my eyes wondered and I was like, what the heck is going on right now?

902
01:19:56,258 --> 01:20:01,927
Yeah. It's great. Great background, gag. Yeah. Awesome. What about you, ben? Yeah. This is definitely

903
01:20:02,266 --> 01:20:09,246
out of the fuse that I've read definitely my favorite. You know, I I love how they just that have the absurdity of the main theme

904
01:20:10,161 --> 01:20:11,822
round things versus

905
01:20:12,322 --> 01:20:15,141
square things, and it's not just like you're stereotypical,

906
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:22,830
like, oh, they're going to find the golden near the, you know, the jade bracelet or, you know, they just... No. It's just... They're looking for

907
01:20:23,249 --> 01:20:32,197
square egg. And so also just like the way it wrapped up in the end, you know. And they never quite... And I I know a lot of the, like, golden generic comics that I have red. It's

908
01:20:33,293 --> 01:20:39,894
kinda wrapped up too nicely. And, you know, there's a lot of wish fulfillment of like, oh, the guy gets the girl, you know or again, and everything

909
01:20:40,391 --> 01:20:47,571
has a happy ending and So I was kind of a surprised to see some of as old as some of these are, just like... You know, they always just

910
01:20:48,148 --> 01:20:51,417
deflate the... Or, you know, they just undercut or be take

911
01:20:53,357 --> 01:20:53,937
It's like

912
01:20:54,517 --> 01:20:55,657
nope this.

913
01:20:56,237 --> 01:20:58,257
It's kinda of this noble failure.

914
01:20:58,597 --> 01:21:01,872
Right? Yeah. And it's it's pretty common nowadays, but, yeah

915
01:21:02,212 --> 01:21:15,727
and maybe he's one of the people who kinda pioneered that concept of, you know, the, like, the... Joseph Campbell store circle where end up back at the... you know, the we can't end up with wells and riches at the end. You gotta end up right back where you restarted.

916
01:21:16,221 --> 01:21:23,974
Right. But I and I and I just love the calling dog Barks and that like it's just a perfect way to end it. So... yeah. I definitely think it's

917
01:21:24,407 --> 01:21:36,703
the my favorite that I've read so far. Good. I'm I'm glad to hear it. I i... Those are good points. I think even people who don't consider this when they're favorite. Like, there's no denying just how wildly

918
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:47,884
creative and invent it is. And it does such a good job of tying everything together. Yeah. I I it also really benefits from those reread, you know, as you

919
01:21:48,221 --> 01:21:53,007
notice things more and more. And and many of his stories do, but this one in particular, I think.

920
01:21:53,900 --> 01:22:05,181
And I've I've already characterized this as one of the community's favorites. Right? We... This is one of the the stories that you think of when you think of Carl Barks on index, the

921
01:22:05,598 --> 01:22:06,696
community sourced

922
01:22:07,272 --> 01:22:13,652
website where people rank these. This one is is an eight point six which is good for number six

923
01:22:14,112 --> 01:22:21,546
out of all the forty one thousand some disney comic stories that are ranked. So this is just in the top tier.

924
01:22:21,964 --> 01:22:41,085
It's basically tied for first. There are a handful of stories that are ranked higher. I need to double check, but I do think that this is the highest one that doesn't have uncle Scrooge in it. A question about that know the oil artwork these send. It does have sc inserted into there. Did they, like, re on this with sc later.

925
01:22:41,983 --> 01:22:43,261
Yeah. That's a good question.

926
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:44,240
I

927
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:55,108
was gonna talk about that a little later, but this is as good time as any. So, you know, Barks famously did a lot of these oil paintings of his stories later on

928
01:22:55,485 --> 01:22:59,956
in the end of his career is very long career. And for this one,

929
01:23:00,337 --> 01:23:03,317
he did do a great oil painting.

930
01:23:03,936 --> 01:23:06,251
A version of his cover that

931
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:08,250
Donald, you know, reaching

932
01:23:08,868 --> 01:23:15,181
for a square egg, but I sent you guys an image of his return to plain awful oil painting.

933
01:23:15,635 --> 01:23:20,324
I don't know. This is kind of a chicken and egg question. I don't know if he did the painting

934
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,439
first and Don Rosa

935
01:23:22,817 --> 01:23:24,448
when on to

936
01:23:24,865 --> 01:23:33,275
do a sequel to this one, called return to plain awful or, you know, if if they kinda did it in conjunction with each other. But

937
01:23:33,772 --> 01:23:41,987
Don Rosa is is another artist who's kind of regarded by many, many people as the closest thing Barks has to an air.

938
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:44,861
He did a lot of sequels to these stories.

939
01:23:45,241 --> 01:23:47,101
And he did a direct sequel

940
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:49,021
where the Ducktales returned

941
01:23:49,641 --> 01:23:51,721
this time with their uncle sc,

942
01:23:52,136 --> 01:23:54,836
and, you know, I I hope to do some

943
01:23:55,176 --> 01:24:05,835
podcasts of some of those rosa stories Sunday. I just love return to plain awful. It gets it gets flint gl gold in there. And, you know, you it really almost writes itself

944
01:24:06,212 --> 01:24:09,721
because you can easily imagine uncle Sc wanting to mount expedition.

945
01:24:10,294 --> 01:24:17,427
For these eggs. But but as much as you imagine where that might go, he he really elevate the premise.

946
01:24:17,999 --> 01:24:33,586
And it's just a wonderful story. I actually read it before I read the original. So going back and reading lost in the Andes or that kind of made a lot of that click for me. Eric, have you read his sequel to this story?

947
01:24:34,558 --> 01:24:42,014
Yeah. I have a copy it. Awesome. Yeah. And and inside the comic, there is a little poster version of this.

948
01:24:42,673 --> 01:24:48,066
Think I might have had that hanging up in the room that in one of the houses that we all live in.

949
01:24:48,801 --> 01:24:54,660
So I've never been able to afford any of Barks oil paintings or lift graphs, but,

950
01:24:54,961 --> 01:25:01,857
you know, I appreciate that at least once, they put out a little poster version of one of them. Let's see.

951
01:25:02,433 --> 01:25:03,691
Some reflections.

952
01:25:04,227 --> 01:25:25,593
We already talked about what's dated an archaic. And we kinda talked about the fact that there's really not too much problematic about this one. Nothing is too retro it. So that's a nice. It's nice to not have talk about that. We talked about those oil paintings just now. And then the only other time these characters have been used is in that don rose sequel return to plain awful,

953
01:25:25,971 --> 01:25:31,074
which it doesn't get classified nearly as high as the swim. But it's also

954
01:25:31,411 --> 01:25:43,892
very well regarded on index. It's like in the top two hundred stories. I do think it's a missed opportunity that neither of the Ducktales series. Ever tried to tackle this story because I think it could have been...

955
01:25:44,589 --> 01:25:49,455
It could have been interesting. On the other hand, I'm sure it wouldn't have lived up to my ex expectations

956
01:25:49,834 --> 01:25:51,253
of lost in the andes.

957
01:25:51,632 --> 01:25:57,686
No. And then I do like to talk about educational value. You know, I feel like this one was actually very illuminati

958
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,180
life in the Andes,

959
01:25:59,638 --> 01:26:01,297
at least some of the incidental...

960
01:26:01,876 --> 01:26:02,755
What did you think Ryan?

961
01:26:03,634 --> 01:26:06,385
I wanted to tell you that I have confirmed that in

962
01:26:07,085 --> 01:26:35,540
used a swift message surface with smoke signals on the summit of the andes from Peru to Chile. Awesome. Thank you for checking that out. You know, My memory said that they did and it and it made sense that they do. Favorite panel is is really challenging for me because I I just love almost every panel of this one. A few of them just in brief that really stood out to me as the hilarious one with all the museum search, you know, Ryan described them just looking like a a ridiculous

963
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,100
collection of of

964
01:26:38,520 --> 01:27:23,585
goof academic goof Barks. I I did mention that I really like that. To me it's iconic Donald clutch the money. That that first shot where we see the last civil is stands out to me. And then the x the the panel where they say, well, the expedition is success. It's that's in some pretty nice silhouette. But it... But if if impressed, I do think that I would have to go for that panel that made me laugh so hard the one where Donald is is yelling about how chickens is the guys that lays these eggs. A lot of the panels around the judgment day, though are are really cool as well. So sorry. I I I... I'm having a hard time limiting myself. Let's go on reverse order this time. Ben, do you have

965
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:30,576
Do you have a favorite panel that stood out to you? Well, not counting the one where either, there's got big wide shot of the

966
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:40,387
square city from above, but I but the one that stood out was... I like the reaction shot of Donald when he eats the egg in the beginning and and just that like yeah.

967
01:27:41,304 --> 01:27:46,988
Disgusting. That's a a nice reaction shot. I agree. Donald is great, and and all of the

968
01:27:47,445 --> 01:27:57,977
assistance have some great great reactions there all in very different ways. Yeah. What about you, Ryan? Any any favorite panels that come to mind? Another one that I think was just

969
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:05,350
done really well. Artistic, it's... I think about page fifteen here. It's the last frame before they go into the fog

970
01:28:05,665 --> 01:28:07,121
they're just around their fire

971
01:28:07,459 --> 01:28:16,591
as night is coming in, and we have Donald and lone nephew in the foreground Al silhouette except for their eyes and then more enough the background lit up by the fire

972
01:28:17,051 --> 01:28:17,990
and you can see

973
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:24,557
kind of the texture of the around they're sitting on and you can see that deep blue of the night settling and around them. It's just

974
01:28:25,054 --> 01:28:27,508
good colors good layout. It's

975
01:28:28,044 --> 01:28:44,353
he's a good artist. Agreed. That that is an awesome one What about you Eric? I I I gotta stick with the chickens. I love them so much if when they find them, there's the chicken with the bubble on rear and it's head cracking up, You know, turn backwards and the boys like No. The roger.

976
01:28:45,248 --> 01:29:02,428
And then the chicken's attacking them because of the bubbles. It's just it's it's it's great because it's also a U boot bubbles blowing public full time annoying everybody. Now you're getting the payback. Per not I think that then say stop bubbles. But the chicken i just... I love the chicken so much. Yeah.

977
01:29:03,146 --> 01:29:04,262
More great choices.

978
01:29:04,781 --> 01:29:06,477
Any additional thoughts

979
01:29:07,148 --> 01:29:31,027
Alright. My question is square aids. It's just such a random idea and obviously, go like, look, Al way it's stack nicer. Sports earthquakes come from this whole yard this whole crazy venture since like it's spun the idea. Where would you get squarespace from? The score and then goes from there. It's a it's a great exercise of of of of story writing of this

980
01:29:31,722 --> 01:29:42,401
extrapolate and they based on the whole thing and it's been fantastic. Personally, I aside from the perspective of Carl Barks was chewing gum and he he was trying to blow Al square bubble.

981
01:29:42,861 --> 01:29:51,115
And then the eggs came off of that idea and then he's like... Yeah. Like man, I love blowing and bubble gum. I love doing all day long. I can't.

982
01:29:52,515 --> 01:29:55,676
People keep shouting and me to stop blowing it, but I'm never gonna stop.

983
01:29:57,449 --> 01:30:04,296
Yeah. I I I do like to think kind of ponder, you know, how the story being about. So that that is fun

984
01:30:05,313 --> 01:30:09,282
also like to add them a little disappointed. If you were going to take sponsorships,

985
01:30:09,939 --> 01:30:14,960
you should have gotten squarespace on this episode Yeah. Our square

986
01:30:15,457 --> 01:30:16,316
payment processing,

987
01:30:16,653 --> 01:30:20,024
you know, just... Wear soft the square

988
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:23,134
I guess, I guess are now

989
01:30:24,005 --> 01:30:29,345
square en. Yes. That's right. This yeah square you. Yep. You know, a couple things that I

990
01:30:29,685 --> 01:30:36,000
neglected to mention is just the fact that you know, we've got that slang for

991
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:38,260
square. Right? The plane off

992
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:43,132
Are literally square, but they're also kind of the slang term square.

993
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:49,570
And I associated out with the sixties, but when I looked it up, it it was coming into v

994
01:30:49,949 --> 01:30:58,220
around this time. So I think that's intentional. You know, that we've also got the slang in America block heads and that was never like directly mentioned.

995
01:30:58,715 --> 01:31:03,043
There, but, you know, there are simple people. So Eric, could you had another comment.

996
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:09,760
Yes. Real really quickly. The only other thing that I forgot to mention I I gloss over the value range.

997
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:24,288
This one's a little bit later, but it is a significant story. So I did find that a nine point four copy a nine point four copy was sold fairly recently for fifty five hundred dollars. So pretty good value. I'll go for it. Okay. Square,

998
01:31:24,627 --> 01:31:26,025
square chickens, but yet,

999
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,779
circular goats.

1000
01:31:28,238 --> 01:31:28,438
Yeah.

1001
01:31:29,396 --> 01:31:30,495
So man.

1002
01:31:30,994 --> 01:31:38,305
Yeah. There's there's a few inconsistencies. Well and when, like the first tea when donald cox and falls open, it's a circular

1003
01:31:38,725 --> 01:31:40,966
would figured would be and more fun the square.

1004
01:31:41,779 --> 01:31:45,472
Right. And I have definitely buddy but he did crack it outside of

1005
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:50,834
playing awful set nope you know, you could poke holes where holes into this. But

1006
01:31:52,286 --> 01:31:57,107
but that but I think on the whole it just works wonderful. Yeah. Just like we.

1007
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:06,114
Us Round have square things in our world too. You know, There's a little over left. That's true. Yeah. Thank you, guys. I know that this one has been

1008
01:32:06,572 --> 01:32:19,496
very involved. We're we're clocking out at... Let's see two hours of raw recording here. We'll see we'll see what I can edit it too. After we and out all my swearing and be like quite a bit shorter.

1009
01:32:19,952 --> 01:32:20,271
Alright.

1010
01:32:20,764 --> 01:32:21,264

1013
01:32:30,876 --> 01:32:35,527
episode. That is... I... you know, be be there or be square. Right? Mh.

1014
01:32:36,065 --> 01:32:36,943
We are stick around.

1015
01:32:37,821 --> 01:32:38,321

01:32:41,875 --> 01:32:53,688
Oh, yeah. Rx do you know that one? Yeah. Familiar. Yeah. That that one is gonna be a challenging one. Going from one that is remembered as one of the all time greats

1018
01:32:54,065 --> 01:33:02,175
to another one that's also remembered as a great, but with with a few glaring issues we'll set. Yeah. Please please come back

1023
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:43,600
Then. I you know, I got I got my square root one in. I don't think i'm gonna top that. So I went yeah. Alright.
