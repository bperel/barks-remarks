2
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:55,605
Welcome back to Barks from Remarks. I am very excited for a pretty landmark

3
00:00:56,103 --> 00:01:01,205
episode here. This is a special enough one that we got a couple of returning guests

4
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:13,422
because I'm excited to talk sc Mc dot that's right. We are finally at Christmas on their mountain, the Landmark story that introduced uncle sc and

5
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:17,011
let me have my guest hosts

6
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:20,935
introduce themselves? Ryan. This is Ryan Bailey

7
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:22,269
back again,

8
00:01:23,386 --> 00:01:24,462
excited for some Scrooge

9
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,456
action here. And Eric.

10
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:36,840
It's nice to and mister Barks Davis character. Which I'm excited for. Yeah. That's right. Were are you guys expecting it to take this many episodes before we had a one?

11
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:40,386
And until I started the podcast, I actually figured

12
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:44,153
Scrooge like what Barks his comics were about.

13
00:01:45,828 --> 00:02:17,059
So it's weird to have you know, how many the first dozen or whatever we've done so far the... Had not feature him at all. I honestly thought we'd could him sooner. But once we started, I was like, Oh, we have to talk about all the colleagues done. Oh, I think we're gonna be here for a while because we actually get screwed. So nice to be surprised on that end. Right. We were in the bs era Al the four bridge before he even exists yes. Yeah. And it's gonna pivot pretty quickly here. We're still gonna have a number of Al stories, but it is gonna be pretty Scrooge centric going forward.

14
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:40,844
Well, let's get into it. I'm gonna talk a little background and then Eric's gonna give a synopsis. We are in November of nineteen forty seven, still just a couple years post war. And we're in four color, number one hundred and seventy eight sometimes called one shot. Number one hundred and seventy eight. I kind of gloss over reprint before. I just want acknowledge that including the original four color printing,

15
00:02:41,183 --> 00:02:48,887
there are twelve Us printing listed for this story, which is a lot of reprint. This is a shorter one. It's only twenty pages.

16
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:54,135
I I think this one is kinda spiritually like a ten pager in many ways.

17
00:02:55,267 --> 00:03:03,504
Eric, you wanna give us kind of the synopsis treatment for this story as you see yeah. Sure. Don and if these are broke at Christmas. Don't know what to do. Luckily for the

18
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:15,307
through who who's it that Cranky yield uncle? Who's never given them anything. Scrooge sc decides that's what he wants to have fun expensive family and they you prove themselves worthy of them or can have fun break getting the out of them

19
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:19,578
invites Al cabinet fair Mountain, but of course, he's tend to scare them pretending to bear

20
00:03:19,997 --> 00:03:23,150
and Soothe and may have coming together as family at the end.

21
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:32,755
Yeah, very good synopsis. Thank you for that. That's right. We're gonna be up on Bear mountain nets Sc second most famous property after is mentioned other stores.

22
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:35,665
No. No

23
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:49,198
not even not even a little. There gonna be whole aspects of sc here that are just never mentioned again. I'm curious. Before this, before we get into this, were you guys surprised by Scrooge first appearance here?

24
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,175
His look is really different.

25
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,050
Than then what I'm used to, obviously from, you know,

26
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,710
Ducktales or whatever. But

27
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,350
otherwise,

28
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,570
no. Not really.

29
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:20,280
How about you? A little bit but knowing this is the first story and not oftentimes with comics yours has to fill them out a little bit before they find the look. And the add going for Whenever there's a common character they don't start flu four Barks intended. But I see that he's not too far off from what he becomes later on. So thought,

30
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,889
I thought it was a good representation of Scrooge.

31
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:24,007
Cool.

32
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:33,545
Yeah. This is kinda one of those backwards, origins where they weren't planned to be I think you can tell he wasn't originally planned as an ongoing character.

33
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:35,681
I don't know if you guys picked up on that.

34
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:51,475
Yeah. I could I could perceive that. Yeah. He looks like, you know, whoever the submarine captain or or whatever the that parent that told them that have treasure inside their restaurant, you know, just somebody somebody to drive things forward for this one issue. Doesn't look like he could be a one off character.

35
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:55,481
Right. He's rich uncle plot device at the beginning.

36
00:04:56,214 --> 00:05:04,167
Right. So a little bit of background trivia. Actually, kind of a lot of background trivia because again, this is a pretty significant story.

37
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:16,916
First off, this is our second story that we'll do that is in the top fifty as far as fan rating. This is a very well regarded one. As I alluded Barks did not initially plan to use sc as a recurring character

38
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:22,141
in a sixty two interview. He said he just needed a rich uncle goal to own a cabin.

39
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:25,710
So we're lucky that he him a bit of background color there.

40
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:38,516
And then in a later interview, he kinda talked about the process of making the story and picking out different elements. Right? He got to thinking about an old rich uncle. He said, pretty soon he brought in their mountain elements.

41
00:05:39,309 --> 00:06:00,975
And then he figured out the reason for that being about testing whether Donald was a brave duck. I really like this part. The quote is that's the way these stories build. I have a bunch of things that have to go into a story. And so I just keep feeling around for the best gag that fit in. It's like sewing together pieces of a shirt. And that does feel apt to me, you know, characteristic of this one.

42
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:05,590
Obviously, Barks did decide to continue to develop sc mc

43
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:11,125
it would just be five months later when he would feature him prominently in the old castle secret,

44
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:20,440
which I think feels spiritually like Scrooge origin and comic. Have you read that one eric? I don't think I have read in reference whether Read old captain Secret.

45
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:27,228
I've possibly read about it. And another stories mentioning it possibly see, I can't remember and know enough of it. Maybe I have in the past.

46
00:06:27,727 --> 00:07:07,947
Or I know else that think I've read it. When you eventually read that one, you'll recognize a ton of elements from Don Rose's life and times, because that's probably the biggest single source for I would say that it's probably fair to say that Scrooge Ducktales going to go on to be Carl Barks biggest legacy and article that you read about him is generally gonna mention him in the first line too that Huey, uncle Sc creator. This is really his claim to fame this this is more than anything what got him ind into Disney's own hall of fame early on. This got ind into the Eyes hall of fame. I mean, his body of work, of course, but I mean, sc is really what he's gonna be remembered for.

47
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:12,973
So, yeah, this is a very significant story very memorable among fans.

48
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:17,785
This is a Christmas story. Right? And holiday stories were really important to Barks

49
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:21,417
when you're writing a monthly comic you know, it gives you

50
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:27,070
a really nice easy hub. So he did like to do a lot of holiday stories.

51
00:07:27,484 --> 00:07:36,865
I read a really good article that Jeffrey Blu, an editor who curated a lot of these stories. He wrote about. You know, Christmas was the the biggest one for kids.

52
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:39,651
So it's hard to get too much mileage out of Easter,

53
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:45,483
you know, Halloween a bit more, but Christmas holds such a fascination among little kids. That he

54
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,994
did, I don't know how many, but he did a lot of ten pager

55
00:07:49,412 --> 00:07:56,120
and a surprising number of adventure lengths stories. We're actually in get to cover a decent number of Christmas stories on the podcast.

56
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:16,470
So you guys starting last episode I was having fun Del some of alternate alternative titles for the stories from languages from around the world. And I've been six of them this time. And so if you guys don't mind ind me. I'm gonna ask this Al to either embarrass ourselves or maybe impress with our pronunciation of the titles in different languages.

57
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,681
And wanna start off with the chile.

58
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,276
I'll start off with Chile.

59
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,843
In Chile we called it Nab, entry,

60
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,395
Christmas among the bears.

61
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:30,226
Excellent. I'm gonna take on France, which I think is

62
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:31,145
nes,

63
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:34,680
which I think translates to isn't that a bear?

64
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:38,275
Eric, you wanna do Germany? Germany show do vest.

65
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:39,915
Probe

66
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:41,095
Scrooge.

67
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:46,083
Very nice. Let's ryan you already got a Spanish language one, so I'm gonna snatch Mexico,

68
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,358
which is Na and,

69
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:51,570
which is a pretty exact translation.

70
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:53,721
Ryan, why don't you take on Norway?

71
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:57,831
It looks like yu pa Bj bj,

72
00:08:58,648 --> 00:08:59,805
Christmas on Bear Mountain.

73
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,356
Awesome. And Eric that gives you Spain. La

74
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:05,793
Christmas and the embarrassing.

75
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:08,325
I would think that there's

76
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:12,925
Yeah. Yeah. That's what i thinking to. But staying staying. They're just gonna do his pain does.

77
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:26,645
Well, and, you know, I just mentally translated these if they were Spanish. And I think too hard on that. I don't know. I guess it would be Easter of the Barks. Maybe someone can explain that. Maybe the consensus actually is Spain good of Spain.

78
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:38,682
Awesome. Thank you guys. Hopefully that's a fun feature to keep. I always like that. So the top down you range you guys for this one is gonna be much higher than most of the ones we've done.

79
00:09:39,337 --> 00:09:45,745
Anyone on a guess what I'll tell you I I found there was one document sale an issue that was rated nine point six.

80
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:49,845
And the last one, we did an episode on Coast of G and

81
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:58,680
adventure down under with Ryan and Ben, you guys know ben. Two separate episodes, same issue. So that one was valued at seventy five hundred dollars.

82
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:04,048
What would you guess this nine point six is value that Error? Nine point six.

83
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,246
The first appearance of Scrooge

84
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,920
Scrooge and make that

85
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,280
Gonna

86
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,940
it's gonna go higher, sixteen thousand?

87
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,580
What do you think? Ryan?

88
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:22,590
I'm gonna go eleven five hundred. The stock unit sale, according to my sources was a hundred thousand dollars. Oh my god.

89
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:36,475
Too. Yep. From what I understand that actually diminishes the value. It does that lowers the grade the golden age comments. You don't want. If that's what you're chasing. Mark, somebody somebody likes these comics a lot more than you.

90
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:37,475
Yes.

91
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:42,879
Alright. So, yeah, this one is quite valuable and quite special at least hoping being that footnote in history.

92
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:56,745
So now I'm gonna talk about some of the historical context for this one. There's not a ton of it to go into, but the very obvious thing to mention, right, is that sc himself is clearly based on Eb Scrooge from Christmas payroll.

93
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,040
Everyone knows this. It's not new information, but we gotta check it off.

94
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:15,405
I would say this is a pretty extreme character version of him pretty hateful of everyone I I guess that's in line with the original Scrooge, but the way he's kinda shape up to be doesn't really match the original one. And then it's interesting

95
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:22,740
Christmas Carol is one of the most adapted media ever. Right? So Barks certainly would have seen this maybe in the movies.

96
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,740
Conte,

97
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:33,617
I think the biggest at adaptation was in nineteen thirty five, and that one was actually called sc. And I think that makes sense. That's probably why he went the name.

98
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:52,927
The other thing, when I read this one, and I see the nephews get this sort of wish fulfillment and Christmas. Right? It strikes me that it sort of matches up with that post war America on the rise. You know, it kind of reflected the american promise of prosperity at the time. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I think that's been interpretation.

99
00:11:54,223 --> 00:11:59,831
Well by naming him Scrooge and having screwed putt and had Scrooge public character, a known name and what

100
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,479
you get a lot of exposition and preparation

101
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:07,045
of this kicker. Just to saying that one line, rich local Scrooge and everyone knows like,

102
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:15,090
k. You don't have to lot spend a lot of time with backstory. It just I must catch the idea audience up, and it's a good device that Okay?

103
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:36,492
Yeah. You're absolutely right. That's a great point. This is incredibly helpful short. And you're right. This is a lot of character development. And one name. So let's see. This is the part podcast where I usually talk about notable appearances. And I mean, obviously. This is the first appearance of edge in the book. Yeah. You know. Big deal. It's a what's

104
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:40,470
incredibly big deal. And the driver. What was the driver's name?

105
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,780
Was it G i it might have been?

106
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:45,192
I don't think it was. And

107
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:49,805
I don't know. James James. So my mountain in kevin james. That's.

108
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:57,620
So obviously, this is our first appearance of Scrooge mc mcdowell. We are not gonna take much note of Edge because once he chose out that,

109
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,740
never.

110
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,902
And which is ironic because he was the care during this comic who was least likely to be eaten by a bear. You could thought if anyone would return it would be him.

111
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,317
That's alright.

112
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:08,956
Alright.

113
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:17,191
So we also get to talk about kind of the version of the characters we getting in these. And this is one where we get to talk about with Donald and Scrooge.

114
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:48,040
And our version of Donald is one that we get pretty often. Right? Donald and economic distress, a very poor donald. But this is passive toward donald. There's gonna be a lot of stories where he's poor but he's striving to make something of himself. But here is just kinda sitting back. And i don't even know how to describe this version of sc because it's so incredibly disconnected from any other version. Any reflections or a question before we launch into the fairly short story itself? No. Good.

115
00:13:48,480 --> 00:14:06,670
Alright. So on the very first page, we open with the Ducktales just generally despair that they don't have enough money for a good Christmas. And they're wishing that their ritual uncle sc would remember them. And you know I like this because he's laying and on really thick Barks to show how where they are. Donald doing the classic showing his empty wallet.

116
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,845
Yeah. Actually opens with Donald saying, oh, what was me whoa whoa whoa.

117
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:14,525
And then we got uncle Scrooge his mansion.

118
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:17,700
And he is just despair Christmas

119
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:35,256
itself wanting to pass, and we learn that he's different. Everybody hates me and I hate everybody. He says. I like... I I was impressed that in his very first frame. He hates Chris. Like maybe the first time I ever saw, K Mc was in Mickey Christmas carol in which he plays

120
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,030
his his namesake sake.

121
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:45,440
And and I figured they made him hate Christmas because that's, you know, what what the role is. But That's how he was introduced. That's

122
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:48,152
the first sentence out of his mouth.

123
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:59,582
That's true. It's canonical correct. I also wanted to point out in this frame, where he's sitting alone and what he described as his big lonely dump. I wanted to describe some of the decorations

124
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:15,699
around him. There's a vase here with the duck on top of it. I can't tell what the duck is holding something around. It could be like Al like a vase that it would be pouring water out of. Could be like a bowling ball for all I know, but it's just perfectly around with no detail on it. Then on the back wall, you can see just a framed

125
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:26,115
picture, perhaps a painting. Of just money. Just bags of money with bills around it and stacks of gold coins because here's a man who just does not love anything, except money.

126
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:40,193
And so he likes Ducktales with what makes him happy, which is money. And then on the far right is my favorite, There's this fancy lamp, like a tabletop lamp that's has a round body and on the round body of the lamp is a painting

127
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:49,385
that appears to be him chasing another duck possibly donald with his cane, like to hit him, and the other duck is running away with his beak open.

128
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:51,742
Yeah. Couple of good side.

129
00:15:52,200 --> 00:16:00,475
This is i guess the very first of these background art features of money of which there are gonna be many many parks and other creator stories.

130
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:02,015
How about you, Eric?

131
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:05,963
You talking about Scrooge like we should know who is. If only...

132
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,850
We'll let the good remember us, but he won. Because none the audience members of Scrooge so.

133
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:27,000
So on the next page, we see Scrooge pacing around and his mansion thinking about how everyone else has fun with Christmas and brainstorming how he can have fun. And he decides that he does wanna give a present, but he wants it to be a test of his lazy nephew donald duck.

134
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:29,515
So he sends dawn telegram

135
00:16:29,815 --> 00:16:36,415
inviting him to enjoy his well stocked cabin on Bear mountain and he adds the dakota Ps, don't let the Barks scare you too much.

136
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,990
So we've got a nice little setup up here. Any comments gentlemen?

137
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:48,021
How many bears have to be on a mountain to name a fair mountain? Like, Is it stick with them? But they're that one there that one time?

138
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,477
You know, it's a mis number. It's actually a plateau.

139
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:55,628
I also got the feeling

140
00:16:56,327 --> 00:16:57,946
the very first frame of this page

141
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:03,100
strikes me Al as him looking out of his mister Burns window. It looks like he's

142
00:17:03,895 --> 00:17:05,475
He in like the mister burns

143
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:10,095
mentioned or or the nuclear power plants just looking out the window at the peasants below.

144
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:21,613
That's that's strikes sense. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. It definitely looks like that. And a lot of ads. I'm realizing on this re reread, There are a lot of site ads with art on this page. So a here on this one.

145
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,800
Is it that Chris strengthens are no longer fun for him? Being never stuck in the world?

146
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:26,797
A?

147
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:30,440
No one can buy him anything he can't making by himself or

148
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:36,359
be no gonna give something because it's Al could shop him to by anything for anybody.

149
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:41,497
I think in this version, he hates everyone and has never given or received one.

150
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:56,140
Is a cold hard man? The only thing he loves is money and chasing other ducks with his cane Alright. So on the next page, we've got sc talking with his butler about the possibility of weather Donald Is brave. And he dismiss it, but, you know, he's planning to have fun regardless.

151
00:17:56,915 --> 00:18:19,973
And then we see the ducks journey to the cabin. Nice panel I'm arriving, I think it looks like a very appealing place to stay. And then when they get inside, they see it's been incredibly well provisioned. It's got plenty of toys and games for the kids and a full pantry of delicious looking food for them. So they Al celebrate and cheer their uncle sp. Jin generosity, you've ever seen Scrooge doing any comments he's featured in.

152
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:21,380
Because it's all part of the

153
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,140
deployed. Yeah. I just know that later comics and he's san us and he still tries to do it on the cheap.

154
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,515
And we have enough lack of continuity that here in there is gonna be generous in some stories. But you're right. For the most part. He's a sting.

155
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,515
If it makes you feel any better, he didn't actually

156
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:41,207
put any of the food or gifts there just made edge and it. Certainly.

157
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:53,481
So on the next page, we've got sc preparing for test, we see him enter another room ask as butler for help. And when Edge comes back, he leaps out. He's been dressed in a pretty realistic looking bear costume.

158
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,838
He scares the heck out of Edge

159
00:18:56,377 --> 00:19:09,616
probably jumps out of the window saying he's start his vacation now. And like I said, we'll never see him again. He felt his death or you decided that that was the last. The vacation date. Up. He's just on extended medical. Yeah.

160
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:10,731
Right.

161
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:22,860
And so screw heads to the cabin directs his show for Jane to take him there, and we briefly cut to the ducks anticipating Christmas the next day. And Donald is starting to feel uneasy about bears.

162
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:40,649
And so on the next page, they are looking outside as it gets dark and starting to see that it's snowing. Don't know wants to take a look around. We get a nice little site gag where he mistakes a squirrel a few pieces away for a bear. And donald pretty much a quiver mess all

163
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:54,070
before anything is given him any reason to be afraid. He's hiding up on the light dish. And then we cut Scrooge sc and the bad weather has boarded his plans and has to turn around and wait for tomorrow to make it to the cabin.

164
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:59,580
And he's upset that his nephews are gonna be enjoying everything in the cabin his dime.

165
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:13,270
And he says I've never given a man a free meal in my life. So I love that that the one comment in his invitation of don't worry too much about the bears was enough to just, like, plant to seed of une terror in brain.

166
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:20,131
That that plus the the the place name on the map. Right? Those two things

167
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:21,688
were enough.

168
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:28,612
The last thing Donald said on the previous page was I hope nothing happens to spoil our fun like Barks I mean.

169
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:37,655
Set the window and it's terrified verified by the squirrel. But yeah, it's just it's the only thing he can think about at this point. It's just Barks. They must be everywhere.

170
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:41,358
In the wintertime. And I love that the boys are able to tell.

171
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:45,641
No. You don't really see theirs in the snow in the winter wintertime. They're sleeping somewhere.

172
00:20:46,174 --> 00:20:54,955
You have to worry about that. Yeah. I like that too. I think that's the funniest the best aspect of the story. How you just Scrooge escalated over, basically not.

173
00:20:56,047 --> 00:21:11,459
So on the next page, we see the depths really enjoying the nice feather beds and Scrooge cabin. And by the next morning, the snow is piled up. They get a white Christmas. They get to have some snow fun. I like this line here where Donald asks them what they wanna have for breakfast.

174
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:14,109
Either for seed caviar Lobster

175
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:23,504
Or Phil filet mignon, the nephew say a dish oatmeal. None of that cheap stuff. This might be the line of the comma for me. He says you'll get Lobster

176
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:26,138
And like it. Who do you think is paying for this?

177
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:32,685
And later on, presume after a lot of lobster for new. They're enjoying a nice cozy fire.

178
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:48,885
Nephews bring up the one hitch that they don't have a Christmas tree. And they needle their uncle bond wouldn't going. They say they've can do buy another woods and cut one for him. Yeah. I like that the kids are too poor to even like or want any of the fancy food.

179
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:54,334
Like they're like, I'm not used to any of this. This is weird. Please just give me some oatmeal.

180
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,391
Right. I assume they're young kids with an un

181
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:06,685
pal who are like, oh oatmeal, like i really everyone. Alright. You guys know how to make lots of uber. Is that... No. I have no idea idea. Let don and know how to make

182
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:08,177
very fancy?

183
00:22:09,352 --> 00:22:18,525
No. I know I've heard of it, but I don't know what distinguishes much is Al from any other labs dish. The first time I ever heard of it was reading this issue of this comic. So

184
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:21,845
because I grew up next door to these ducks

185
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:36,406
and their same neighborhood. So Alright. So the nephews are really pleading with him to get a tree. They're trying to convince him. There's no bears out there. They throw an epic tantrum that's the only thing get him to go out amongst all of those bears.

186
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,835
And he immediately runs back in saying he's

187
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,227
saying he saw bear tracks.

188
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:47,344
When an f fu go to investigate these see it's just a rabbit or tear or something harmless.

189
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:56,099
And Donald grants the whole way looking for a Christmas tree and they realized that the trees are buried under all the snow. I can only imagine a kind of

190
00:22:56,878 --> 00:23:04,935
psychosis that would have to be going on in his mind to look down at they do a good job of conveying how tiny these tracks are in the snow that surely, no.

191
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:14,763
No, even a newborn bear would be able to produce tracks this small much less pose a threat to. And I like that the rabbit is just like sitting harmless

192
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:15,999
hill

193
00:23:17,016 --> 00:23:28,165
got. I love this the same dollar that at one point and strike went to a swamp in Florida where they know mad ga. Yeah. But at least it wasn't named like Gator a gold or something that would have been all he could think of.

194
00:23:28,865 --> 00:24:05,365
So the duck search and search and eventually have to settle for a scrap we look and tree. That only has a few branches and a big suggestive hole in it. But you know, it's got some charm in it, kinda like Charlie Browns Christmas tree. So they cut that one down and carry it back. And again, it is a suspiciously heavy treat. And by the time they get back and decorate it with some colorful pop bottles. The after users thank looks pretty good. Donald just looks at it hateful because it nearly cost him his life as far as he's concerned. So he goes to get some more expensive food and the ducks Al leave the tree, we see a couple of eyes in the hollow and a little bear cub emerges.

195
00:24:06,142 --> 00:24:09,570
And the Barks have grow in a drink bear that's about his size

196
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,330
here that and go to investigate.

197
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,945
So this this this page had what for me was the line of the comic

198
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:23,885
where on its way to the fridge Donald says, after risking, my life to get that tree, I need Vi. What do we have pests?

199
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:26,205
I decided I'm going to adopt that phrase.

200
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:29,277
As I'm headed to the kitchen to feed my kids.

201
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:32,273
Right. And they do

202
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:33,930
not good.

203
00:24:34,984 --> 00:24:36,283
When do we have this?

204
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,479
And it seems like they do have more success sophisticated lots to

205
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:48,264
lots the new bird. I you were see how fast pallet the Nephew tau improved, strawberry short pink frog and the winter quail Barks

206
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:50,282
in cream socks.

207
00:24:51,594 --> 00:24:52,094
Sounds.

208
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:57,880
That sounds pretty adventures based on my knowledge of American cuisine

209
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:01,410
around the the greatest generation era.

210
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,050
And this stuff. These are one

211
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:12,393
eating cell. Yeah. We can't think about that too hard. I thought about... I actually thought about that as I was reading this and I thought, you know, I eat a lot of mammals.

212
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:14,848
Yeah. Absolutely.

213
00:25:15,185 --> 00:25:23,261
So said they go to investigate, but it's just the nephews who go because Donald immediately knows it's a bear and he jumps on the counter to hide right away.

214
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:32,166
The bare manages to hide itself by the time the depths are in there, and you know, it's the classic gag where the bear looks like the stuffed animal it's hidden next to.

215
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:42,070
Don sniff around. He says he can smell that there's a bear in the house. He says he's got pal politicians of the gi, which is a fun way of things freaked out.

216
00:25:42,725 --> 00:25:49,320
And when their backs are turned again, the bear goes and finds their strawberry short kick. So my thought was My thought was about

217
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:56,440
the old deal old of, like, you'll get your inheritance if you can spend a night in this haunted house or whatever. And and

218
00:25:56,754 --> 00:26:03,154
and I feel like I know where this is headed you know and and sc has his bear outfit that he's going to use to

219
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,006
scare the jeep out of them.

220
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:08,552
And and test their metal, you know? And then

221
00:26:10,007 --> 00:27:00,180
we get this kind of double fake out going on. I'm thinking of the movie captain Marvel where T, the scroll is terrified of the cat and everybody's laughing at how Silly he is be terrified of a cat because he's an alien, and he doesn't know what cats are, and he assumes it must be some kind of terrifying monster and then later we discovered, That's not a cat. That is a terrifying monster and it starts swallowing all their enemies, and I love the the two layers of gag there because each layer is funny on its own. And here we have kind of the same thing here where they hear some harmless noise and Goes, that was a bear. I know it. And it's because he's totally out of his mind with fear about Barks. And yet, he is correct. That's at point. That is some good comedy there. And he's absolutely right to be afraid based on what most people know that if you see a cub, there's a good chance mama Barks there as well.

222
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:03,255
But it's only through, like, complete accidental

223
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:21,150
bone headed writing now. That's true. If everything is a bear, eventually something that is bear, you will be right. Did you think about of the there? That I was gonna say, I love the old time phrase. That right up there with hey kits that Scrooge screw. You're gonna give them the papers that there's so many colleagues. Whatever he's like Scrooge. Huey, get the diapers

224
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:53,115
Al right of the together. And my read of this is that it's supposed to sound like out of time even for this era. I'm not sure. But I I think this is just supposed to be, like, he's he's using a really funny way of saying. I'm trying to imagine him saying that another that voice, and I don't think I can understand it. So when I read these, you know, in my mind here, you not using the Donald duck voice at all. He's using the classic narrator totally easy to understand voice. And Barks never makes any jokes about it being hard to understand him or.

225
00:27:53,933 --> 00:28:01,836
Ever since that first issue where he was a street wise tough guy, I've I've kind of been reading him as a street wise tough guy. I'm I'm picturing like an accent from Queens.

226
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:03,907
Something, you know. Yeah. Yeah.

227
00:28:04,804 --> 00:28:18,599
Alright. So on the next page, you know, the depths kinda hud wondering what's going on. They see the strawberry short keeps on. None of them have eaten it. So we see Donald just getting progressively more and more freaked out. He's back to the fixture

228
00:28:19,056 --> 00:28:23,263
and the nephews user thinking that he's probably right, but they're brave enough to go investigate.

229
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,825
And then the kids are out of the room. The Barks comes out does some investigating

230
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:28,665
on?

231
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:55,878
Yeah. It's interesting the bear returns to its it's hollow inside the tree. Have we mentioned the giant hole in the three. Yeah. I mentioned it, but I probably didn't describe it that well. It's accurately big enough for him to hide in. And so the bear kinda of lunges at one of the roller skate. At this point, Donald has this side. It's safe to run down. It's not. The bear runs him over and you get some pulled over. He doesn't see what it is, but it leaves some Barks hair. So we cries out and the back to the light fixture.

232
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:56,756
He

233
00:28:57,254 --> 00:29:24,555
tells his nephews where the Barks headed it and they follow. And then the next page sees the nephew tripping on that roller escape. And briefly knocked themselves out. Long enough the Barks to hop on and try out the skate. And when their uncle calls out to them they're they're able to respond. They're okay. And they go to the parlor where they hear the Roller skate. This is fun. This is a very like Scooby doo kind of moment as they're all bumping into each other and happened to not act actually see what the threat is as they are accidentally

234
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:27,695
knocked out of their senses against the wall and that sort of thing.

235
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:32,326
Yeah. You're right. If this were animated, it would be easy to show the class

236
00:29:32,665 --> 00:29:38,152
from room to room. Exactly and god. Very shaggy question ahead could you eat yet? Answer me. Tilly.

237
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:39,450
Please.

238
00:29:41,063 --> 00:29:55,331
So they pursue the bear on the next page and it runs back into its tree hollow grabbing a box of chocolates on the way. And they finally figure out what's been making all the noise when it toss the empty box out. One of the Fuse goes up and drags the bear out just explaining.

239
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,165
So

240
00:29:56,783 --> 00:30:22,050
I like just a affirm. So when you've establish something. I think all adopt that. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Boy. The kids... The kids have really had it. They were... They they wanted a Christmas so bad. They wanted some Christmas presents. And if somebody's going to mess with their roller skate, even if it is an Apex predator, they are having none of it. And I guess this will start a pattern of sc being impressed by the nephews or he should be impressed by them. They're always the ones living up to his expectations.

241
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:28,611
So the caveats away and we cut over to the stump of the tree, which appears to be the top of the bear hi

242
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:31,046
spot because mama bear

243
00:30:31,384 --> 00:30:34,174
realized that the cubs is gone and emerges.

244
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:36,332
I should say, absolutely

245
00:30:37,111 --> 00:30:40,288
destroys the stump emerging from it. She is absolutely

246
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,745
enraged as a good mama bear should be.

247
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,700
She tracks her pub Uncle Scrooge just cabin.

248
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,620
Ryan, can you describe her entry?

249
00:30:49,120 --> 00:31:10,641
Terrifying monster, She tears the door from its hinges a storm since the front door? Yeah. She looks pretty fierce there. So the nephews Barks still looking, and they managed to convince Donald to come down by telling him what a time and insignificant little bear. Another level the whole Scrooge with Donald. There's no bear. There's no. There's the there. Oh, It's just small bear. It's lot dangerous. Oh, the big bear.

250
00:31:11,415 --> 00:31:31,115
Of the yeah. The mis directs. Yeah. The mis action is pretty good in this one. So they they continue to convince him on the next page of how incredibly tiny that there is, which gives to handle the confidence to to venture out he rounds the corner and he immediately encounters the sn mama bear. Looks genuinely terrifying.

251
00:31:31,615 --> 00:31:52,525
And he gets off a pretty good wine. If that's the berry you saw, he's grown pretty fast. And we get the cartoon gag as he and then the next deep out of the window and terror. Yeah. Yeah. The the nephew talking about how tiny it is. One of them one of them has to be two inches off the ground. If Don can hear the foot pitfalls, he can hear the pitfalls of a lady bug around the court.

252
00:31:52,945 --> 00:32:08,544
So on the next page, donald has jumped out of the window, and he says, ryan you wanna cover this one? He says give me land, lots of land. Don't fencing me in. So I was like, he's quoting something there. So I looked it up All of you western Music fans instantly recognize it as a very famous

253
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:09,940
It's called

254
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:12,612
Fence, written in nineteen thirty four,

255
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:14,146
music by cold porter,

256
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:28,264
Members of the western writers of America shows that is one of the top one hundred western songs of all time. Originally written in nineteen thirty four for Adios Argentina, an un produced twentieth Century Fox film musical. Wow. That's all I sound. It was performed in nineteen forty four by Roy Rogers,

257
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:38,701
then slightly later in nineteen forty four by Bing crosby and the entrance who recorded it in thirty minutes and it became the number one song in America for eight weeks. He's not a man to do a second

258
00:32:39,335 --> 00:32:43,915
So anyway, this is... This was... You said this issue from forty nine. Right? Forty

259
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:59,675
seven i think. Forty seven. Okay. Yeah. So this is three years after it was you know, the gigantic smash it. Right. So this is a conte reference. Pop culture reference. Yeah. Yeah. And I knew this song. I'll see if I can find a nice snippet of it to hopefully put it right

260
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:00,375
here.

261
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:01,795
Me

262
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:03,155
of land

263
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:04,475
guys

264
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,772
I never the world rogers version is kinda yellow.

265
00:33:12,905 --> 00:33:23,605
And so on the next we see that Barks take over. They trash the presence. They enjoy the Du food. You know, the ducks are just stare in through the window watching their Christmas get destroyed

266
00:33:23,943 --> 00:33:45,492
slashed to devoured. And Mama bear falls tentatively asleep by the fire, while they're shiver outside and I like this page a lot, and it it takes a page of a twenty page story. So maybe it's a weird thing to say this. But almost wish he had gone more on on further with this because it could have been fine to continue seeing the bear trash in Christmas.

267
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:47,883
I like that these Barks are obviously hi

268
00:33:48,355 --> 00:33:54,695
and woke up. And like, oh, i the spend energy. What's the first thing that you do? Maybe the stuff ourselves. Let's get into makeup for having been interrupted

269
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:59,306
Yeah. And there's no hi nation like lobster new, hi.

270
00:34:00,764 --> 00:34:02,822
After after eating a whole box of chocolate.

271
00:34:04,094 --> 00:34:05,073
Yeah. That's right.

272
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:14,464
Alright. So the ducks watch the mono bear drift off. And the nephews fuse tail bundled, you've got to slip inside and tire up and he reacts as well as you might expect to this.

273
00:34:14,882 --> 00:34:17,377
But they point out, you wanna be frozen out here?

274
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:34,840
And so he very t leak goes in deal with Mama bear, while they very bravely go after baby there. And pretty a great and famous sequence here of Donald to put mama bear with his knees knocking and terror. And when she lets out outside, he just absolutely

275
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,780
loses it and faint.

276
00:34:37,795 --> 00:34:39,771
Actually say knock knock.

277
00:34:40,507 --> 00:34:41,007
Yeah.

278
00:34:42,062 --> 00:34:46,470
And so Brave nephews easy the three of us are taking on that one that's us but

279
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:55,331
Oh come on. It's a bear. The other one is to sleep the mom asleep. This is a live waking bear looking at them in the eye.

280
00:34:56,025 --> 00:34:57,005
They are ducks.

281
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:10,773
Alright. So in case you forgot uncle sc was in this story as well because this is where he returns. He gets to the cabin and he's kinda spying on them. He gets into his bear costume.

282
00:35:11,112 --> 00:35:16,665
He enters an immediate at least he's the Barks cub. He leaves behind the sofa in time to stay hidden,

283
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:35,612
but sees his little ran nephews chasing the ferocious beast as he calls it. So he can see they're fearless, but he continues on to try and scare Donald because that's who he really wants to test. He wants to know whether Donald has the gi of Al lion, but he has pal of the unfortunately.

284
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:37,050
Yeah. That's right.

285
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:49,492
Alright. So on the next page, when he does spot Donald, he sees Donald sleeping on the arm of a monstrous sc bear and so he's convinced that Donald just like him, he doesn't know the meaning of fear.

286
00:35:50,623 --> 00:36:06,991
As soon as the Barks size again, Scrooge freaks out, he leaps out of the bear skin and runs away. He tells his driver about how brave the nephews are. He wants James to invite them to the feast of their lives that his mansion tomorrow. And meanwhile, he's gonna think of an appropriate present for Donald.

287
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:12,328
This is this is a great resolution. This is great moment in any far where we get

288
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:17,128
the kind of culmination of everything. When you see. The results of all the

289
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:19,563
chasing from room to room and

290
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:25,405
misunderstandings and nonsense going on And now Sc has incorrectly judged his his

291
00:36:25,865 --> 00:36:39,540
nephew donald to be the brave the duck in the world. That's right. It's all gonna come together. Scrooge the exact same thing, Donald then except over the Barks side and he runs away. Scrooge just completely abandoned the bear costume, which I don't know if they was gonna wonder why is they're fair costume.

292
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,875
So I you know as much as Scrooge fruits oh my Nephews a pretty catch screw ran too.

293
00:36:45,575 --> 00:36:48,316
Yeah. Are you suggesting some hypocrisy.

294
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:58,067
Although Scrooge ran away from a live bear and Donald ran away from tiny rabbit tracks in the snow. So there there is a differentiator.

295
00:36:59,535 --> 00:37:01,471
Doesn't know that. Yeah. That's true.

296
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:15,931
So the last page has the ducks of that celebration. The kids are enjoying some toys. Scrooge just having the time of his life. Right. I don't know what, but it cracks me up. He says, why am I having final wow. Here, Don, have another peanut.

297
00:37:16,505 --> 00:37:17,885
It's very non

298
00:37:18,185 --> 00:37:24,620
of Al line, very unscrew like And so after dinner, he's gonna present Donald with a president and takes it out with an

299
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:34,411
unnecessary flourish. The freak donald out by presenting him with a genuine siberian silver tip Barks skin, which promptly makes donald faint.

300
00:37:35,106 --> 00:37:40,745
And the nephews do a good job covering for him by saying, Donald must have eaten too much turkey or peanuts.

301
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:42,420
It's been lot last panel

302
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:45,656
rationalizing this by saying for a moment there.

303
00:37:45,995 --> 00:37:47,414
I thought he was scared.

304
00:37:47,993 --> 00:37:56,906
We get some more good p from Donald head hitting the floor with a punk. Yes. And the trademark x's for us. Show that he's he's out.

305
00:37:57,598 --> 00:38:04,611
Does the picture of money above the couch? I don't know what it is. Is it's a statue of a coin or a I days of Al lamp? Oh yeah.

306
00:38:05,224 --> 00:38:09,454
I like the Barks immediately really got into the money motif of Scrooge,

307
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:12,087
an element that is only gonna pick up.

308
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:19,540
Well I'm wondering, if it's just this this is a kids comment. We have to show the rich. That's the easiest way to show is where it's just that pictures of money around.

309
00:38:20,115 --> 00:38:26,249
Yeah. It's always funny though to see someone who decorate that theme. You guys we didn't know we talked about

310
00:38:26,788 --> 00:38:29,520
Christmas on beer mountain. Scrooge

311
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:31,897
has now entered the conversation.

312
00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:34,814
What did you guys think of this landmark

313
00:38:35,153 --> 00:38:38,205
introduction to sc mc Ducktales?

314
00:38:38,764 --> 00:38:54,205
I'd like it was good. It was a very simple start but it was very funny and had the right car pizza that Donald Bing screw up. It's nice. How it changed Al little bit, I mean Donald, the have evolution of that sometimes he's brave, if he has to be, other times he's coward or other times he's mean and this one, he never changes

315
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,244
he's always a security cat.

316
00:38:56,582 --> 00:38:58,361
And he tries you very anybody's sales.

317
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:03,050
And and that's okay because that's two dollar... I like that. I think it's true and it's

318
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:12,801
consistent, I think. There's select ones where he'll be brave when Barks needs him to be, but it's usually with a pretty good reason. He doesn't usually stick his neck out unless he has to.

319
00:39:13,895 --> 00:39:20,075
Did you feel like if you had read this, not knowing what was to come, would you would expect more of this character?

320
00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:50,762
Well I mean, at least in some of the other once being one shot characters, but it really be nice to surprised adam expand family. Which you know, introducing characters new comic it's hard, especially when you've already Al the main character, to be kind of a band aid and start writing these other characters when you have the Nephews and donald and it's pretty much set. To introduce the new car going be that's pretty bold. I mean i would not have expected knowing how these come operate, but me knowing that there's one the side character is now the k. Yeah. Definitely be offer him. What did you think, Ryan?

321
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:55,742
If I was reading this as a one off, I could see I could see sc being

322
00:39:56,278 --> 00:39:57,775
used as the kind of

323
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:05,727
home base sort of character sort of kind of anchor for the the family of advent Ducktales of donald and the nephews

324
00:40:06,145 --> 00:40:19,143
going off to check out some mystery or whatever and then, you know, calling home to uncle Scrooge for to help out with some pick them up with a plane from, you know, whatever island they're stranded on or something like that.

325
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:26,935
I could see him being a, you know, recurring recurring side character there. Maybe continuing to be sort of uncle plaque bias.

326
00:40:27,794 --> 00:40:29,172
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

327
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:32,568
Yeah. Like, i need someone to go export in belly. When you do that?

328
00:40:33,587 --> 00:40:45,324
Yeah. Gonna do sexy uncle V Knocking out and they need some alphabet to pinch. Right. You know, I for forgot to mention, on the very first page, it's weird to see the nephews refer to him as uncle uncles. Scrooge

329
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:46,960
instead of un Scrooge.

330
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:51,609
I I'm not sure if this is the only time that happens, but it might well be.

331
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:56,220
So, you know, we we always check in on the

332
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:10,746
index general consensus. It's a good way to to see how the average fan feels about this one. This one is a very high rating. You know, as I mentioned, this is in the top twenty five. It it clocks in at number twenty five.

333
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:18,381
For all of the Disney comments. If you're only looking at the Barks stories, there are only two in the top twenty five that are not Barks

334
00:41:19,074 --> 00:41:32,161
There's like, one Gottfredson story and one story by Romano Scarborough. So this is like the twenty third best rated Barks story. It's got an eight point one out of ten, which puts it in, like, the ninety nine point nine

335
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,820
percentile for best.

336
00:41:34,435 --> 00:41:36,495
I would say that it's probably

337
00:41:36,796 --> 00:41:46,503
a pretty big inflation. Right? Just because it's such a notable story. Because personally, you know, I I do like this story. It's a lot of fun, but it's a very slight

338
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:57,105
story. Right? It's it's not it's not very... It's not very deep. It's it's pretty silly. It's just what it is. It's a fun little holiday yarn

339
00:41:57,605 --> 00:42:03,600
and it's got some good slaps to. But I I don't personally regard it as anything special

340
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:05,120
story wise

341
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:06,880
other than just coincidentally

342
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,241
kind of having

343
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:09,154
Scrooge.

344
00:42:09,634 --> 00:42:14,927
I think if you took sc out and just put in like a generic uncle money Barks character

345
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:23,751
This one probably wouldn't be regarded as well as it is. That's not to come down hard on it, because I do think it's a lot of fun.

346
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:29,009
Especially once you get past the fact that Scrooge really doesn't resemble

347
00:42:29,426 --> 00:42:31,936
much of what he's going to go on.

348
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:38,165
You know, I I think it's interesting too that this is one of the longer stories that has...

349
00:42:38,983 --> 00:42:45,175
It feels like a ten pager to me that's been spend out into a twenty page. A lot of the ten pager

350
00:42:45,515 --> 00:42:50,076
have this sort of theme of the ducks having to dealing with money problems.

351
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,148
And we don't see that in as many of the adventure

352
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:53,987
stories.

353
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:58,981
I think I think if it had been a ten, I think it would lost some of the

354
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,672
some of the punch of

355
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:05,575
the double fake out and the, you know, different kinds of far elements

356
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,620
that we got to

357
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:24,927
draw out and then get the get the payoff for. I think we would... I think it would lost something. I definitely agree because I think part of why this works is you get to see that steady buildup of Donald getting more progressively freaked out, which is better to see over the course of twenty pages.

358
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:37,485
Because I do think it's really funny. This is one of Barks funnier stories at least of this length, which are not always as interested me being funny. They're more often interested in being adventurous and exciting.

359
00:43:37,985 --> 00:43:48,363
Because it's not one of those far flung adventure voice. It holds up pretty well. There's not really anything in here that's problematic. We don't have to acknowledge anything that's kind of retro grade?

360
00:43:48,701 --> 00:43:54,817
There is some kind of fun archaic stuff in here. It's neat seen Donald to get delivered to telegram at the beginning.

361
00:43:55,575 --> 00:43:58,486
The whole concept of, like a Barks skin Al a gift. Right?

362
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:05,054
I've seen these skins and old cartoons a lot, but I don't think that Barks are really a thing these days.

363
00:44:05,813 --> 00:44:13,625
Except I guess for cent billionaires. I I am an eccentric billionaire and I can confirm yes that is that is what we're into. Yeah. Well, there you go.

364
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:29,575
Boy appearances and other media. I mean, even without going into the fact that sc is gonna be a major character for more than just Carl marx. You know, this story became a huge part of what Dawn roses is gonna base life in times of Scrooge Mc,

365
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:33,295
his epic telling of sc history on

366
00:44:33,635 --> 00:44:45,259
because he he chooses to have the final chapter issue twelve, I guess, of that Saga is basically all about the period of time in between it starts off when he leaves the cabin, basically

367
00:44:45,597 --> 00:44:49,529
before they have their dinner that night, and it concludes later after this.

368
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:52,900
So Don rose, dealt with this day in his own comics.

369
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:53,820
There

370
00:44:54,320 --> 00:45:01,550
there have been a couple other comic stories that have referred to this. There was a sequel someone else did called return to Bear Mountain.

371
00:45:01,888 --> 00:45:07,036
I know I read it a long time at ago, but I can't really remember it. So I'm not sure how well it holds up.

372
00:45:07,928 --> 00:45:09,105
I'll have to take a look.

373
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:20,797
Barks did do one of his oil paintings on this. It's called Merry Christmas. It's a pretty great image. It's a painted version of sc sc and his chair from the very beginning of this story.

374
00:45:21,134 --> 00:45:23,166
So I'll put that up on the Facebook page.

375
00:45:24,418 --> 00:45:30,783
I don't think there was really anything too educational about this one. But again, it was a lot of fun. Favorite panel.

376
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:46,007
I i really enjoyed a few of these panels. I enjoyed seeing how well stocked the cabin was. You know, the pound the fridge full of provisions, the ducks were at. I I think I mentioned enjoying the panels of Donald getting Frightened.

377
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:58,381
And then, you know, it's it's hard to resist that panel of Donald having fainted in the Barks arm. And then I guess some of the establishing panels of sc and sitting in that chair sc.

378
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:11,055
By you guys Erica, any any panels come to mind? I like the treatment of the mom very popping your head up and hulk out. And then just to ridiculous of them while very ripping a apart of the stump that she's in and back down the door to help establish

379
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:12,135
whole

380
00:46:12,555 --> 00:46:17,910
america. Also squirrel around and just over emphasizing how big and how loud and how scary.

381
00:46:18,249 --> 00:46:20,827
I agree. That's a pretty great sequence.

382
00:46:21,566 --> 00:46:29,510
What about you ryan? I I think I'm gonna go with... There's one as the bears are eating the chocolates and opening presents.

383
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:38,750
There's a shot in between of just the three nephews and donald from behind from out in the snow. Looking into the glow, the warm glow of the inner

384
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,510
cabin there of the window just watching

385
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,950
say, say, that's the end of our Candy presence

386
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:47,115
sigh and it's just kind of the culmination of all our

387
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:51,578
misunderstandings and and craziness and setups going on. And now they're just

388
00:46:52,010 --> 00:47:03,942
barefoot in the snow outside on Christmas day or Christmas eve or whatever this is. Just... You can't see anything inside except for the yellow glow of just the you just imagine all the warmth and christmas y

389
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,356
love and goodness that's inside being demolished by theirs?

390
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:12,431
Yeah. That is a great one. I looked at that one too. Excellent.

391
00:47:13,251 --> 00:47:31,083
Any any closing thoughts guys. One or two thoughts on the question. Mark, you said literally kind of goes back and used him for the old capital secret. Do you know if he run Scrooge back because he won't used the character or was this issue solar or see that it felt like you need to use Scrooge care? That's a good question. I don't think he got a lot of correspondence

392
00:47:31,622 --> 00:47:42,350
about how well the issues did. I'm sure they had circulation numbers on it, but he was he was anonymous for so much of this. Like, they always stamped walt Disney on the

393
00:47:43,171 --> 00:47:43,671
So

394
00:47:44,010 --> 00:48:04,171
no one knew who is doing these until much later when some dedicated fans sniff him out. I wasn't sure if the end came up with come up and said oh, that's really good comic and character. And me go back and expand on it. Right. And I'm guessing it was all based on reading the interviews he did and just how he took on the character. I think it was probably his own re of using the character.

395
00:48:04,508 --> 00:48:08,611
That's why he went back to it because he obviously was highly motivated

396
00:48:09,227 --> 00:48:41,731
to use. The other comment I want to say at this comment, these these comments are obviously geared towards kids. And I think that's the reason why the net these are so prominent and such as road figures these comics so they can kind of identify with them. And that's adds you back in the fourteenth fifties. So kids getting in trouble and mischief shift not back and down it also makes you under... This is the old choke of the wish fulfillment of I wish i had a rich uncle that was swoop in from wherever It shoot me whatever I needed. And help me have a wonderful Christmas. And you see that can you see that in old tiny movies? And it's just that wonderful oh you're the you return. Now we can do this now we can that any direction.

397
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:58,380
Now these kids are just getting by. Now like, can hey, now they live the highlights that's such a kid wish. Yeah. I think you're right. That's a great way probably one of the more plausible ways to have that kind of wish fulfillment. Right? Is where your your uncle is a a bitter man who's trying to play a trick on you.

398
00:48:59,633 --> 00:49:00,891
Well, going forward.

399
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:07,637
Yeah. Anything else gentlemen? No. I don't think so. I think this is the the funniest one I've read so far. I I laughed out loud a couple times

400
00:49:08,191 --> 00:49:10,571
reading this one. They had some solid salad gag.

401
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:27,778
Yeah. I thought this was good solid riding better than where. I mean, you're right. I think if that kind of his the international Scrooge, but, you know otherwise, above average story. Yeah. I appreciate that comment. Ryan? This one is maybe not Al show we as some of the adventure ones, but it is really good well crafted piece of comedy.

402
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:33,572

00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:11,575
Excellent,

411
00:50:12,113 --> 00:50:12,613
and

412
00:50:12,951 --> 00:50:16,165
you got to read Christmas on Barks Mountain,

413
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:19,597
the famous first appearance of uncle sc mc

414
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:22,802
First meal, what did you think of the story?

415
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:30,114
I like it. I thought it was really funny and I enjoy the sea grandson the story.

416
00:50:31,013 --> 00:50:36,266
Awesome. Yeah. I think this one's really funny. It's not as adventurous as some of them, but it's

417
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:41,152
It's a very funny one. What what did you think were some of the funniest parts?

418
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:45,163
At the end where uncle Scrooge

419
00:50:45,762 --> 00:50:46,994
shows Donald

420
00:50:47,769 --> 00:50:49,522
the his Barks

421
00:50:49,562 --> 00:50:50,062
the

422
00:50:50,597 --> 00:50:53,208
and he fainted and. In

423
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,259
Horror.

424
00:50:54,995 --> 00:50:56,930
Yeah. That was a good one.

425
00:50:57,427 --> 00:50:58,724
What did you think of

426
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,852
Uncle sc this being his first appearance?

427
00:51:03,542 --> 00:51:09,686
I thought it wasn't one of his best ones, but I thought it was he was really funny in it. Right on.

428
00:51:10,899 --> 00:51:12,694
Right on, how about the nephews?

429
00:51:13,093 --> 00:51:17,962
I thought it was kinda cool how much of the story they were in. What did you think of Huey, doo and Louie?

430
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:32,611
I thought it was really funny that they were encouraging donald and that they weren't afraid. Well, they weren't always afraid. They were afraid of the little cub, but they were kind of afraid of that big one. Mh.

431
00:51:33,251 --> 00:51:35,211
Right, Which seemed pretty sensible to me.

432
00:51:36,145 --> 00:51:42,957
Awesome. Do you have any other thoughts or anything else you wanted to say about this story? Any other favorite parts or anything

433
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:51,427
I like it when uncle sc is in that bear costume and he sees the little bear and he is

434
00:51:51,884 --> 00:51:52,584
he is

435
00:51:53,576 --> 00:51:57,036
in horror and in so much shock Mh.

436
00:51:57,856 --> 00:51:58,816
That was fun.

437
00:51:59,256 --> 00:52:02,456
Alright. Awesome. Thank you so much for coming back mia. Mh.
