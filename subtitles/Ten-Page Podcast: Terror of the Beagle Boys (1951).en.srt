Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Mc Ducktales writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge con of all time time. This episode is a ten page podcast, all about one of his short stories get ready to enjoy our remarks.

3
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:38,960
Welcome back to Barks remarks, we are here with a new episode of the ten page

4
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:41,092
podcast I'm Barks Sever.

5
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,375
I am a grown man who likes talking about Stuck Comics and I am joined.

6
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:50,760
By a new guest, another grown man who

7
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,069
also likes talking about them and

8
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:59,624
and and has other involvement. So don't introduce yourself? My name is Fay Ko,

9
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:09,580
and I am a twenty year or so veteran of the Disney comics as a professional. Yes. I did work on them when I was a key teenager. And

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,180
Carl Barks has remained my all time favorite cartoon.

11
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:27,973
And I'm throw the b here Barks excellent. Yeah. Thank so much for joining that. I I really appreciate it. I have delusions of Grandeur, so it's it's great to get to meet people who've got some involvement with the comics

12
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:36,166
and and just to chat with long time Barks fans. I should mention our our story that we're covering today is is.

13
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:37,483
Oh absolutely.

14
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:56,885
We've got the classic ten pager the hair of the beagle boys. But before we get into it, that... Do you mind telling us a little bit more about, you know, your involvement with the comics? Well, it's interesting. I did not read the Disney comics really lot as a child. I got into them as a teenager actually.

15
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:07,975
Because of my interest in the classic at Hollywood would New York animated cartoons of the golden age. And I was starting to run out of cartoons to watch so I went to the comics,

16
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:20,704
and I sort of found out what a lot of other people did that the Disney comic universe is a lot Richer, then its animated counterpart. As far as actually engaging characters.

17
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:23,560
And of course, Carl Barks

18
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:25,989
rose to the top of my list.

19
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:39,020
And as I said before, he remains my all time favorite cartoon. I I should add I didn't need car carl as a child at a show with my father, but I had no idea who he was at the time

20
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,473
and could not appreciate it. I just saw this ancient

21
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:52,556
ancient man there. And he was just very warm and you know, when when you're a child, sometimes you're like, you know, wow

22
00:02:52,935 --> 00:03:24,000
who is this guy, you know? And and it's sort of stayed in my mind a little bit, but It it pushed out it pushed out because, you know, he... You know, when I was a kid, you know, was like, okay. This guy wasn't involved with Loo too he wasn't involved with the mu. I don't know who he is and then it came back and couple years into my re reread of the store like, I think I met him and I asked my like fog hair you like, I think you did too when me check and out, yeah. You did. We don't have any... I don't have any photographic evidence, unfortunately, but

23
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:38,131
and I did not get to have any conversations, but as I was a child at the time, I don't wanna have any delusions of grandeur that that would have been a very important conversation. Bill. That's Al that's a pretty big, like a retroactive

24
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:46,413
thrill. Right. You you can say that, and and no one can take that away from you. No. No. They can't. So that's that's awesome.

25
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:53,413
I I like what you said about the the Disney cartoons, you know, and and the the difference between the comics

26
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:54,251
and

27
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:01,800
and the cartoons. I I grew up small child just consuming the Disney cartoons. I loved them.

28
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:11,979
Watch them over and over, you know, it's how I got into the comics, and Mh. But but like you say, once you kinda make... Once I made that transition, I was like, wow. There's

29
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:26,798
there's just this. This golf between the two of them. And and it wasn't until much later that I had not a good idea of just how much involvement Carl Barks himself actually had with some of those cartoons. Oh, yes. Absolutely. He was...

30
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:38,873
In fact one of the main writers, of course, is discussed of the Donald Cartoons for at least seven years or so. So you mentioned, like, the classic New york cartoons,

31
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,295
you know, that you that you're a fan that Is is that stuff like like the fl?

32
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:46,938
Yes. The prices. Yep. The B studio

33
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:52,211
by Me and Dave yes, They were the main competition for Disney and the thirties

34
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,109
Right. You can totally see why you pop by a sale it clips the mickey mouse.

35
00:04:58,668 --> 00:04:59,686
Oh, man is

36
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:02,956
I... Every couple of years, I have to watch

37
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:04,248
send that.

38
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:20,596
Oh, absolutely. I Al send Barks. That's that's just... So and you have your own podcast, right, that you... I do. It's sparingly updated, we actually just put up a new episode. It's called cartoon lodge. I c it with my long time friend

39
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:21,770
animation director

40
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:25,399
Jake's who was the animation director on Running S

41
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:32,153
And we actually did do cartoon by cartoon breakdown of all the slice your top eye shorts

42
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:33,911
that was behind a pay

43
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,680
on our pay site, but we do plan on making those pop podcasts

44
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:52,215
public. Yeah. I'll be sure to check that out because I I have I'm the kind of person who has the appetite to listen to a couple of grown men talk about the plastic pop by card. She might be to guess. Right now they're

45
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:55,945
that they actually help me appreciate them even more.

46
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:39,503
Especially with Bob because an animator of his caliber, it's usually always owed Disney Disney Disney. But Bob is all about the Fl and what they brought. Very cool. That... That's great. I I will be sure to check it out. Let's let's go ahead and transition into Al. As I said, tear of the beagle boys. This one, it should be said right away is very notable. Bad, why don't you tell us? Why this one is so notable. Well, Al listeners may have guessed, this is the very first appearance of the beagle boys. The arch drive also Scrooge Inducks, the ones who are always trying to rob him. And they only a appear at the very end of the story. It's all about the threat of them in this ten pager.

47
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:58,044
And it's one of the more ingenious stories that Carl parks did because Mark as you... As I saw on your notes, this is very much stage like Al play because almost the entirety of the story takes place in one room. And with only the two characters donald and Scrooge.

48
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:59,222
Exactly except

49
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:08,091
two walk guns of a messenger boy and the beagle boys at the very end. Yeah. Absolutely. That that nails it. It's it's

50
00:07:08,548 --> 00:07:11,442
great. It's it's the kind of staging

51
00:07:11,994 --> 00:07:13,292
that you can picture

52
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:22,866
theater notes for right stage or four. And it's very much the kind of staging that I did not appreciate as a kid.

53
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:33,801
Right? Like, I I went back to this one later on, and I was like, oh, This is hilarious. This is genius. But as a kid, this was an incredibly frustrating.

54
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:49,945
It it would be like taking a small child to see waiting for Good dough. Yes. Exactly. Well, that's the brilliant thing about Carl Barks is that he's clearly writing these for kids where, you know, you might be a little frustrated kid, but there's still funny stuff going on.

55
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:57,540
Little bit of slab stick or actually quite a bit of slaps like towards the end. But Carl was writing these for smarter kids,

56
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,940
which we

57
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,475
as we grow up. And, you know, you just keep going back and back the these and this is definitely

58
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:08,075
firmly in Carl's golden age

59
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,675
which was roughly

60
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:29,497
forty eight to fifty four fifty five or so. Especially these ten pages. I'm glad you're doing episodes on them. Because they're almost consistently all little jumps. Yeah. For sure. I, you know, I I really changed gears a bit, and and I had to almost force myself to start by the ten pager.

61
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:39,005
And no regrets because I I would have missed so much if I didn't cover these and and, you know, they don't require as much preparation

62
00:08:39,821 --> 00:09:12,279
which is nice. So it helps me keep up my my crazy brake neck release schedule, but but they're they're so fun to talk about. So you mentioned Golden age, no arguments there that's a good segue for for the little the background details. This one came out in the the publication date is November of nineteen fifty one. And it it was, of course published in walt Disney comics and stories for the states. There been a decent number of reprint counting the original, we've got

63
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:13,754
seven printing.

64
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:22,106
But but that... I I noticed something interesting scrolling through in index is that this one has, like more countries of publication

65
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:27,240
than these stories typically do. There's like countries that I've never seen.

66
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:29,835
Listed like Fe Islands

67
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:31,155
and

68
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:31,995
Latvia.

69
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:49,430
Turkey chimes in Huey, lobby I see the lobby occasionally, but a lot of these don't make it to to this many country So I think it's fair to say that this is kind of like one of the uber. Uncle screwed stories. Right? This has a bunch of hallmarks of the character.

70
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:55,920
So so it it just... It's a good one to print because it's it's kind of the essence of the character.

71
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,055
Correct. And I would... And I think to a lot places into it is

72
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:08,751
you don't need to understand American culture realty to get at all of the humor. This is purely about the characters

73
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:25,817
all throw throughout. Yeah. It's it's very character driven in the... In the way that the best Barks stories are. Let's see. Sometimes I'll cover trivia and and other interesting facts about these, you know, we can we can talk about that kind of organically and we've already mentioned

74
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:34,070
the first appearance. But anything that you'd like to Huey, up or mention before we kinda dive into the story itself.

75
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:35,785
Not particularly,

76
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:40,025
but this always seems to be a go to story when

77
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:51,963
new licensure comes into the American publishing of Disney Comics. They'll run this story was in the very first Gladstone uncle Scrooge issue. And and I believe it was in the first Gems

78
00:10:52,419 --> 00:11:05,950
uncle Scrooge issue as well. Nice. Yeah. I didn't... I don't have the first gen. I do have. It it might it I might be off on that. I seem to recall that, but, you know, I have a no fact checking rule for the ten page

79
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:42,235
podcast. Of course, this became the title headline story for the Fancy graphics collection that rep the Kinda surprising when you consider some of the heavy headers that that that are yeah i they're looking Al. I was I... That's the version I have in front of me right now because that's the one with dangerous disguise and old California and no such environment in it. So you figured they would wanna use one of those for, but. Right. I kinda... I I gotta give them credit that they did use their of the beagle boys because it really it it Well, I'm just looking at it, and this is a very strong book.

80
00:11:42,735 --> 00:12:01,194
If you were trying to convince someone of Carl Barks greatness this would be a good one to point them to. Oh, yeah. But yeah, You got hand it them. I appreciate the bold of that choice. Yeah. It's definitely an essential story. I did forget that I I did wanna cover some of the... A couple of the foreign language titles

81
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:13,502
So we'll do that before we jump on in. I like to pick a couple of these to panda to the listeners from around the world but especially in northern and Western Europe. So let's see why don't I

82
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:15,500
start off with

83
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:20,547
Swedish? Alright. So in Sweden, this one is called Khan vac,

84
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:26,008
which just means the Canon guard. And then Italy, this is called Lab Day,

85
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:27,962
the band of Hounds.

86
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:31,555
Which I think refers to the beagle themselves. Yes.

87
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:35,455
And then I'm gonna I'm gonna go with German. They're sell.

88
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:44,321
The the self shot. I really like that one. It's it's a bit of a spoiler, but not until you realize what happens at the end.

89
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,474
And in France, This is known as laser,

90
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:50,870
two. The rapid take everything,

91
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:52,269
another spoiler.

92
00:12:53,127 --> 00:13:17,470
Yeah. And I think the rapid two are the beagle in in France. Right. Kinda interesting. I I think in Italian, you you've... You've done some of the local icing. Right? I In Italian, the beagle are, like a different dog. Right? Are they doc consultants or something like that? You know what? I don't know that offhand, but I can't really fault anyone because one of my questions is the beagle boys look nothing like beagle,

93
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:30,607
So you know, that's a low utilization Liberty. Yeah. Hound works pretty well. Alright. So that, we're gonna we're gonna get into it where each gonna describe a a page and and offer up some some indecisive

94
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:42,267
commentary on on the page. That, I I love how the this story opens. Oh god. Yes. It's one of the best ever... It it is a classic opening.

95
00:13:42,684 --> 00:13:43,982
We've got Donald

96
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:46,035
Clearly and Scrooge office.

97
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,667
He is pacing,

98
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,662
and he is

99
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,739
be morning,

100
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:51,976
or w.

101
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:53,652
He... He is clearly

102
00:13:54,164 --> 00:14:04,769
concerned. And and what what this page does, so wonderfully is that it it kinda throws the reader in, We just see Donald looking worried and pasting back and forth and it

103
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:10,653
us, and then we pan back and we see Uncle Scrooge, bus accounting his money.

104
00:14:11,212 --> 00:14:16,631
And Donald does asked king. He's saying that he's been pacing the floor for four hours

105
00:14:17,526 --> 00:14:20,555
and he asks his uncle if he can stop and rest,

106
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,230
Scrooge tells him he can't rest

107
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,570
because he's being paid thirty cents an hour.

108
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,830
To do his worrying

109
00:14:29,465 --> 00:14:37,265
for him. And and again, it's this great setup because you're like, drawing the reader in first off. What is Donald doing?

110
00:14:37,665 --> 00:15:00,619
Oh, and and then explains. He's Scrooge has outsourced is worrying to him. Right. Which again just leads to some more intrigued. Yes. This is a yes. As I said this is one of Carl's most and ingenious stories and that we don't really get the plot until a quarter of way in because because this is all just leading up to it. This is completely unnecessary,

111
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:06,260
but it's brilliant in every way. You're you're right. Though it's all in intrigued.

112
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,571
Very beginning. So Donald continues

113
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:15,397
and Scrooge in one of the great Carl Barks systems says put more woman in those grown.

114
00:15:16,276 --> 00:15:26,412
And when I pay a non big money to worry for me, I expect them to scream and holland and tear his air. And screws goes on saying that's better. You know, Al donald pour on the

115
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:40,502
some more. And he's saying how, you know, for thirty cents he expects the works. And Donald brings up something the reader probably wondering You haven't told me what I to worry about. And screws, of course, is losing his mind because

116
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:48,666
Thanks. This has all been for nothing if he's just been paying Donald for four hours. It's a dollar twenty wasted. And download

117
00:15:49,005 --> 00:16:00,143
forgotten Yes. He's forgotten what he was paying Donald to worry about. And that's a Al a classic. Again, another classic Barks does as we'll Severino later stories where Scrooge is

118
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:12,843
preoccupation with his fortune has made him forget about more pertinent matters. It's so classic. That that idea that he's outsource worrying so he doesn't have to think about it. And then he can't even

119
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:32,740
can't even remember what he's supposed to have worried about. It's it's awesome. I do love how Donald really throws himself at this point. Into the worrying. This does reminds me. It does evo Barks to the cl deck, right where he he he has trouble with his memories. So this is kind of around the same era.

120
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,575
Fairly close. So we

121
00:16:35,113 --> 00:16:53,705
year or too before. But... Yeah. So... Because this is when this is when Bark is really hone screwed into his own and he's not just a supporting character for don all these become his own character, which is why he's sort of Al overtake in this story and when gets reprinted, they b it out donald about and put on Scrooge.

122
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:56,060
So a lot of people wouldn't know the difference

123
00:16:56,477 --> 00:17:01,326
Exactly. Yeah. This is one of those where either a character could technically get get billing

124
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:03,814
So on the third page,

125
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:11,772
they're interrupted by a knock at the door. And we get another classic Scrooge touch where he's gonna... He's kinda greek

126
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:19,516
in intruder by an almost lit canon. And it's followed immediately by another. Super classic Barks

127
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:27,375
where a messenger boy opens the door and it's one of these just utterly ancient messenger boys

128
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:36,819
that I love Bark, like over the top old man messenger boys. Oh, yes. This is this this goes back to a lot of Carl

129
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:47,015
animation routes and crank cartoon roots and the thirties because this is a trope that would show up danny the messenger boy is really this ancient weird at old man.

130
00:17:47,552 --> 00:17:52,895
Listeners if you're familiar with a Frank Cash Pork pig ka pork Al the crocodile arrow.

131
00:17:53,348 --> 00:18:47,648
It has... That has a similar gag in that one as well. So you know, it's it's something, you know, Carl is a pure gag cartoon said hard sometimes and yeah, this is just something he throws in for a jeep laugh, and it gets the laugh. I definitely. It definitely does. I appreciate you mentioning that. Because I'm wondered how loud before when I did the episode for super snoop. Right? I assumed that this is a long running trouble right but I couldn't think of, like, another example, and this is the third time in the course of doing the podcast that I've seen can do it. Yeah. So so the the messenger boy sunny as he calls him, you know, asks him what his tell telegram is, and the guy reveals that it's from the chief of police. And and so again, the camera is sort of pulling back more. So we're we're we're getting this information dripped. He learns that The chief of Police has told him the beagle boys have alluded the police

132
00:18:47,985 --> 00:19:04,946
Beyond guard and that's what Donald is supposed to be worrying about the terrible beagle boys and and we got a a a nice classic shot of Scrooge kicking donald in the bun and and cha him to get back to worrying in. Mh. Of course, Donald is going back into the,

133
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:36,207
but screw just telling him to do several things at once. You know. Think of a way to stop those drivers. And that's a big plot hole in this story, they that is kind of Carl's joke. You know It's like, where are the guards for this fortune that he just keeping in his office? It's it's it really is just... We're we're supposed to believe it is just in, but that's that's the beauty of carl Barks. You know, you don't really think of that until, you know, your eight or ten three reading of the story. And of course, there's the this other joke of that would become a long standard

134
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:51,648
much money if you Gottfredson Scrooge? How would I how would I know? It take thirteen years to count it? And since donald Barks worrying, and Donald gets the idea Well, why don't you use the canon, you just almost shut the messenger boy with and Scrooge apps and minded.

135
00:19:52,067 --> 00:20:03,530
Oh, why what why didn't I think of that? And he's ready to fire it Al that will. And and I love that. Again, that in itself is a great gag that he was like, ready on a moment notice to obliterate.

136
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:09,286
Whoever might randomly call on him and didn't think to use it against the B boys. Mh.

137
00:20:09,963 --> 00:20:15,265
And this next page is awesome because it's It's really about the canon itself.

138
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:15,962
Yeah.

139
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,251
Which which is kind of this like little, it's it's one of the tote.

140
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:24,658
Of Scrooge Doc, not as much absolutely.

141
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:42,979
Like, not as much as his his number one dime or or or the fan sell for the bennett itself three awesome and kane. But... Right. But but it's what we bark fans we love this detail. Right? And and and it's not the first time that he's used this canon. I think that was in the pixelated

142
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:43,978
parrot.

143
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:50,106
Right. Not too long before this. But this is the first time that he's he's referenced.

144
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:54,440
Donald asks him if the powder in it is fresh.

145
00:20:55,054 --> 00:21:26,673
And and he says, well, sure. I bought it loaded right after the war, and Donald asks him which war and he says the borrower award don't you Al on dumb. Yes. That's one of my favorites. I've tried to work it in. Any story I eyes with can, and I always try to make sure but there's a Bo war reference. And, of course, Donald being a smart Ass here just... Because he knows how frugal his uncle is, like, you know, he does... He definitely did not fill this after World war two. So

146
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:39,176
what which war is the legitimate question Right. And and it's such a great reference for the reader. Right? Like World war two was was pretty darn fresh at this point. But clearly didn't have canon.

147
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:47,802
Of this type and and the borrower war, if if listeners don't know is just before the turn of the twentieth century,

148
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:56,398
It's like just obscure enough to... I feel... I feel like it's a perfect punch line. Right? It's like it's like the old

149
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:57,316
comedy

150
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:10,784
about the words that are funny. Right? There are just some some words with with the certain types of sounds For whatever reason, the idea of this Canon being from the borrower war is inherently funny to me. Yeah sad.

151
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:30,080
Oh, sounds like it's a great prop. And so is the Queen's victoria of royal dill? Yes. Yes. He he he starts to get nervous. Right? Scrooge gets nervous because donald pointed up the powder it might be low and as you say, he we see it labeled as as such Queen victoria's,

152
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:34,639
So as Donald leaves rubbing his aching came back from his

153
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:40,498
hour four hour and ten minutes work where you earned a dollar twenty two cents.

154
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:48,006
Scrooge is just utterly loading the canon full of powder, not not knowing how much is necessary.

155
00:22:48,462 --> 00:22:56,570
And so... And so we continue this play like story with screws waiting for the beagle boys here. Here we go. He's waiting for a good go.

156
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:08,210
Yeah He's waiting and falling more and more sleep and he's it's long past time and those lazy routers haven't showed up yet because, you know, he's just itching for a fight because he went through all of this,

157
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,490
and he can't hold his eyes open much longer. So he phones

158
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:18,999
board donald look for help, and donald threatened him that he's not getting out of bed for any less than fifty cents an hour.

159
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:32,523
Scrooge cuss them out and balance right over and he falls flat on his face asleep as soon as he gets there and screws, oh, you're gonna be a lot of help. But both decks that that the expressive

160
00:23:32,901 --> 00:23:33,919
in this story.

161
00:23:34,457 --> 00:23:37,751
They they're both just the the very picture of exhaustion.

162
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:44,839
The previous pages, you know, we're Scrooge is looking looking nervous and desperate and the Donald

163
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:45,719
phone

164
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:46,599
desperation.

165
00:23:46,939 --> 00:24:05,394
It it's it's Great. It's why this story is great. So so both Ducktales are basically fighting to stay awake and they're, like stressed out about Scrooge especially is stressed out about how to stay awake and and so he he tells him to go back to worrying to figure the best. Yeah. Yeah

166
00:24:05,973 --> 00:24:07,710
And Donald gets another

167
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:09,266
another epiphany.

168
00:24:09,803 --> 00:24:35,070
He says I've got it. I figured it out and Scrooge just him what? He pratt falls a asleep immediately. It just just perfect timing. Yes. It's that's it's... It shows how Barks missed this medium. You know, he... You know, he's he's eager to tell the idea any immediately false flat on his face so and he's so pissed doubts crew chest to dump a bucket of water on him. Right. And what was the idea?

169
00:24:35,488 --> 00:24:46,594
And so when Donald does wake up, he tells him his idea is to rig the canon like a like a spring gun so that the first person who opens the door has is obliterated.

170
00:24:47,506 --> 00:25:01,227
And, of course, you know, this this is a comic book. This is the Disney comic universe. So screws thinks it's genius idea despite again, if anyone takes a moment think about this, We've got some pretty major issues of liability.

171
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:03,245
And in treatment here,

172
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:09,674
but we are we are in that universe. Right. And so they... And so they rig up the canon,

173
00:25:10,013 --> 00:25:15,164
and this is very cartoon it's going back the Barks is days is a gag cartoon too

174
00:25:15,624 --> 00:25:38,665
at both the studio and then print and it... It's of course, a glove hand what's striking the mask. So Just, we know that we're in a Disney comic. Yep. You know that we could the fuse, the canon shoots and blue goes to beagle boys. And i, now remember. Don't open it to wide. You know. It's just foreshadowing what immediately is follow. And as they leave for the night, diamond nine,

175
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,079
Yeah. Still only twenty five cents for the half hours work. And u oh.

176
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:52,988
Yeah. Of course. And, of course, since Scrooge just pre preoccupied with paying Donald. He's not gonna remember what he was just old. Right. We we've just basically,

177
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:59,865
the prospect of paying some money is is going to, like, etch sketch his brain. And so

178
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:07,514
so on onto to the next page, Scrooge turns to unlock his office while Donald catches a quick snooze. Yes.

179
00:26:08,432 --> 00:26:30,259
I left that detail he's already passed up. And he passes through the in sewage shenanigans. And screws just opens the door with such confidence in just just so determined and so wide, and the reader knows immediately what's about to happen. And the shot of Scrooge, the perspective jump drawing of him facing yes canon

180
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:32,811
is just just fantastic.

181
00:26:33,946 --> 00:26:40,602
And And so the predictable happens. Right? He he sets off the canon. He a claims

182
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:44,948
in in fear and then he slammed the door closed.

183
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:48,195
As though as though, that's gonna do anything.

184
00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:52,419
Fortunately, he manages to duck before the Canon

185
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:53,576
smash.

186
00:26:54,393 --> 00:26:55,390
Straight through the door,

187
00:26:56,043 --> 00:27:06,255
straight through the wall of what what is still the Inducks office building. Not already been. Right. At this point, And then because of the x excessive of powder that he used.

188
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,405
We see it go through three additional

189
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:17,930
rex three additional buildings, and there's a great word balloon with of the under understated... Heaven's the best to Betsy. Yes.

190
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:42,459
We don't we don't see him use that kind of explanation much I don't think going forward, but but this is a great moment. And on the final page, it shows a pretty con controlled bit of card tuning. With the bouncy beauty mattress factory being the last building the can goes through, and it brings it back goes right back into the building. Scrooge explains my lands the gotcha

191
00:27:42,759 --> 00:28:04,359
and, of course, destroys the safe wall destroys the back of the bin wall the classic bin wall and Myself safe. My home money bin has been bus like a paper bag, and it spills onto the street where we see for the very first time, the beagle boys shoveling literally shoveling the money away off the street on the public property.

192
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:48,109
And Scrooge is chasing, donald off. Know, you and your bright ideas, and Donald is preoccupied with his own concern of never mind to Barks K is still owe me twenty five cents. And I think this is about is perfect to ten page story. Carl ever did. You know, because, you know, we we would get the we would... It's kind of like a disappointment sometimes. I guess when you're a younger reader and you're told... Oh, this is the first. This is the first legal boy story is like they don't show up to the very last panel and they don't show up until the very last panel of the next story there in either. And I just think that I I don't think he could've ended it anywhere perfectly because it was really, you know, just titular

193
00:28:48,424 --> 00:28:57,644
error of the legal boys that... That's the star the story. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I perfectly said. I I totally agree with you. Right?

194
00:28:58,557 --> 00:29:18,370
What you said about this being kind of disappointment to a kid is true, especially, like in the era of reprint right. Yeah. Where you're reading these out of orders. So like I I have that experience where I I had read a couple hundred stories before I read say Christmas on Barks mountain.

195
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:21,524
Mh. And and really became

196
00:29:21,902 --> 00:29:26,007
preoccupied with how weird that like very first version of

197
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:36,227
Scrooge that I was so familiar with was and and it takes a few reread to kind of get past it if you're a kid and and to be able to appreciate the story

198
00:29:36,724 --> 00:30:00,169
itself. And and in this one, the beagle boys, there they're one little post script appearance. I look... They look so goofy and so weird. Sad, what what what is so weird about them in this one? Oh they almost looked like generic villains, you know, the more like the thugs that were in the pixelated pair at the Prototype type beagle boys there. You know, the original coloring

199
00:30:00,906 --> 00:30:02,203
make sure to

200
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:04,476
give them all different color shirts.

201
00:30:05,252 --> 00:30:07,986
They don't have the prison numbers on their

202
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:15,959
shirt just yet. Right But, of course, this is, you know, this is still big it's the first story ever with them. And you've just got

203
00:30:16,473 --> 00:30:23,289
appreciate it for what it is. And what it it... It... What it is, is just about donald and Scrooge on Psyche and relation.

204
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,687
And with... And because it

205
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:34,785
that relationship so spectacularly well, it's sort of like patty to yeah how, well, the vehicle boys aren't actually really in this.

206
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:38,557
This is just a brilliant bit of story telling in cartoon.

207
00:30:39,055 --> 00:30:39,135
Yeah.

208
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:40,488
Absolutely.

209
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:41,685
Right? They're

210
00:30:42,022 --> 00:30:46,432
completely incidental. To the story except as this like looming

211
00:30:46,810 --> 00:31:03,681
threat I imagine it might have even crossed his mind who knows to, like not even have them at the end. Right? Because you don't really need them. The point of the store is not the beagle was. Right. They also have hats like caps kinda like the matthews.

212
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:17,168
Right. Right. Right. And I'm I'm wondering, you've got the fan graphics, which is like a reprint of the original. Does it say B boys like incorporated on their their buckets. It just says beagle boys. The

213
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:27,314
incorporation hasn't been established. Yet. Okay. Yeah. Because I I saw a reading a little background. I guess some reprint they would like erase the incorporated for some reason.

214
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:34,494
Like you said, it probably hadn't been established at this point. They they have... They have there's a lot of inconsistencies in the printing.

215
00:31:34,952 --> 00:31:38,024
The Fan graphics just for the record for all listeners

216
00:31:38,324 --> 00:31:42,144
They do try to make it as close to the original Western

217
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:43,624
publication as possible.

218
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:46,239
And that goes for some of that

219
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:48,639
particularly crappy coloring,

220
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:59,454
but I digress. Yeah. I mean, I I agree. I I get what the mission is. Right? They're trying to reproduce them for for that type of collector, but

221
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:10,404
boy there. Some just lovely coloring additions of these stories by, like, people like sue devil each. Oh, yeah. The believe the bleach and the lights Scott Rockwell.

222
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:21,559
They did fantastic jobs with these printing. I tend to not like when they use gradients and the reprint. I just don't think it looks particularly right. But

223
00:32:22,296 --> 00:32:24,924
Reader should be aware that the leech are

224
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:49,244
intermittently. And the leech are involved more now with the fan graphics sucks. And even using think the limited Al they've done a lot more taste and they look a lot better. I just wish that they got involved Al lot earlier. Well, that that is good to know. I... I'm glad to hear that. I I was thinking to myself a few weeks ago in the course of this project that, like, I might have read more pages

225
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,179
of

226
00:32:51,078 --> 00:32:54,753
reach work than like any other creator when you

227
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:58,389
What you think about it. Yeah. No. Soon Gary.

228
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:01,381
Yeah. They're they're they're heroes of mine,

229
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,535
just like Scott. And, you know, I think what they do is appreciated by a lot of fans

230
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:13,109
Yeah. Hiring very under appreciated. Well... And I'll I'll go on record of saying that...

231
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:15,763
Well, there might be know, arguing

232
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:21,789
online over it. Carl Bark himself is very appreciative over what Glad and onward

233
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:26,474
did with his story. Goes, he always despise the western coloring.

234
00:33:26,812 --> 00:33:31,863
Yeah. That... That's another good point to make The the coloring on those stories really

235
00:33:32,201 --> 00:33:33,674
elevated them. Oh.

236
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:35,172
So, you know,

237
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:41,225
we're we're in we're in agreement. Right? This this story is is a tight

238
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:42,119
and

239
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:46,314
incredibly well paced. Bit of character study

240
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:48,232
slaps stick buff.

241
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,450
It it is.

242
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:55,964
Super funny, and I'm I'm really glad to have, like, gone through it in in this kind of excruciating

243
00:33:56,504 --> 00:34:00,450
detail No. It's just to keep repeating ourselves. It's a just

244
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:20,329
famous story, and it's just really the two characters donald and Scrooge and their element and and as we've discussed and, hopefully, you've realized this is why the publishers keep going back to this story as a high like... Yeah. For sure. And this is definitely one that I've, like, developed, you know, a new

245
00:34:21,749 --> 00:34:35,329
appreciation for in the course of doing this. Because I I remembered it pretty well, but as I revisit and I was like, oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. This one, this is amazing. And the community is in in wide agreement with this one, you know?

246
00:34:36,089 --> 00:34:40,609
Huey, be has... They definitely should be. If if you look it up on Inducks,

247
00:34:41,063 --> 00:34:55,729
you'll find that it is one of the very highest rated of of all the ten pages. I made a little list at one point where I pluck those out. Tear the b boys ranks as the fourth highest rated of Barks ten pager.

248
00:34:56,129 --> 00:35:03,838
Now now overall, it gets seven points seven, which is good for a hundred and fifty nine out of all forty one thousand some

249
00:35:04,257 --> 00:35:05,929
Disney comics. So

250
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:25,819
very high theme, I don't think it's... I don't think it's inflation. Right? Because of that first appearance of the bill boys. I people are just remembering this. They're just remembering it. And as you said at the top of the podcast, this has been reprinted in places that usually don't see reprint So it's

251
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:34,114
everyone every faithful reader of the dot com knows it and, you know, it it just shoots up just like the... What's story and

252
00:35:34,852 --> 00:35:35,352
oh

253
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:40,612
the Hit no gun story and a few others. Mh. And they just remember that is the classic

254
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:41,808
of the.

255
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,699
Yeah. Just we remembered legendary,

256
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:47,819
lot of fun. So we we've had a great

257
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:48,699
conversation.

258
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:49,859
The

259
00:35:50,255 --> 00:36:07,001
best way to wrap it up is is to do our little favorite panel feature. We got a ton of them and we've highlighted a few, but that, are there any that you would like to call special attention to? Let me see. The the borrower don't be so dogg on dumb.

260
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:14,112
Just this just like in my permanent Lexi just that line. And, of course, the the shot of the

261
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:36,767
the buildings being destroyed by the canon with the understated evans to Betsy seat. Those are just two of my favorite Barks panels ever. And, of course, as you said, the perspective shot of Scrooge looking into the camp man. Yeah. That that one is is definitely a winner. The pen ultimate panel of the money porting out of the Bin is quite lovely. It's a nice art,

262
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:47,714
not the first time. That not the last time that won't see money pouring out of the Bin. I have kind of a weird one, you know? Because I grew up in the era of reading the Gladstone con,

263
00:36:48,115 --> 00:36:52,095
They used one of these panels as like one of their

264
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,030
you know, in house ads,

265
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,950
and it's the one of Donald

266
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,230
at his most

267
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,829
dramatic saying

268
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,045
ski reach

269
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:08,285
Wow the beagle boys yeah. And it there's a reason that they use that one, you know, He's like, curled over practically horizontally.

270
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,214
Really giving giving his job of being screwed his warrior.

271
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:18,480
His his absolute best. He's... He's earning that thirty cents an hour there. Mh.

272
00:37:19,277 --> 00:37:20,615
Yeah. I love that one.

273
00:37:20,993 --> 00:37:21,892
Let's see.

274
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:25,138
Sometimes I do talk about, like, references

275
00:37:25,596 --> 00:37:26,255
to other

276
00:37:26,593 --> 00:37:27,093
sql.

277
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:40,570
Right? Like, it... I guess it bears mentioning that the beagle boys are going to be a character that has, like a pretty long after life. Right? Oh, yes. They'll be used in dozens of stories by Barks

278
00:37:41,488 --> 00:37:42,667
and other creators

279
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,638
they will be adapted

280
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:46,756
into the Ducktales cartoons.

281
00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:49,313
They get their own pretty

282
00:37:49,772 --> 00:37:51,550
crummy comic book line

283
00:37:51,984 --> 00:37:54,879
into the seventies under the whitman

284
00:37:55,337 --> 00:38:05,595
imprint. I And I'm sure there's some decent stories through that. There might be. I wouldn't count on it. But they did... They even got their own nephews, the beagle brass.

285
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:06,053
Right.

286
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:10,844
And no they're... I I just think they're the perfect

287
00:38:11,304 --> 00:38:14,204
series for screws, you know, they're they're stupid

288
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:20,535
and they're on on they're sla, you know, but they're also an organized crying family

289
00:38:20,874 --> 00:38:23,412
and you know, that's Scrooge just worse nightmare.

290
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:28,773
And I think you know, Carl just came up with something really brilliant with

291
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:43,622
and, you know, paying homage to all the crooks and bandit of the comics he grew up reading or rad Al. He was a professional cartoon illness. And, you know, this one holds up very nicely. Sometimes I talk about how these have aged well or poorly.

292
00:38:44,401 --> 00:39:05,542
Apart from, like references to the Borrower War Canon, this is such a timeless story you could... It's it's very universal like we've already said. Honestly, c elements like that bo war, you know, that well, kids you gotta go reach something else time. Why you to look up what that thing just to look it up, You know, you you weren't something that day and

293
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:15,589
but, yeah, this just... And I think that goes without saying why it was so heavily reprinted like we said earlier, there's nothing that dates it. There's no real cultural

294
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:34,621
aspect do it. It's just very universal all the way around. Yeah. And and I I think that we we did a great job with this one. I think we covered what we needed to. So, yeah, listeners, thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you took the opportunity to revisit this great ten pager

295
00:39:35,734 --> 00:39:37,554
