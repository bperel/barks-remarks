00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:07,525
When

2
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:24,006
Thanks for joining us for our Halloween themed episode to the ten page podcast.

3
00:00:24,644 --> 00:00:36,217
After getting the trigger treat ear where stuck in your head. I just wanted to make a quick note that this episode has just about five minutes of a little bit of echoing

4
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:37,054
dialogue

5
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:44,284
before we figured out how to address it. So, you know, yeah, hopefully, you won't notice it. But

6
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:54,434
it shouldn't last too long. So enjoy the episode. Welcome, back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever, a Grown man who enjoys dot com,

7
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:57,443
and I really love Halloween.

8
00:00:58,074 --> 00:00:59,969
As well and talking about Halloween,

9
00:01:00,546 --> 00:01:09,520

10
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:11,639
discuss a couple of

11
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,093
ten pages or at least close enough to ten pager. For this

12
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,607
episode of the ten page

13
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:18,443
podcast,

14
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,228

15
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:32,759
and With Willie, but before we do that, my guests today, one one is new and one is returning. I've got Tim Arts and Henri

16
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:33,676
Who

17
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:37,044
who are Dutch comic artist.

18
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:55,395
And I am just always so thrilled to have duck artists on to talk comics so you guys thank you very much for joining me. Why don't you introduce yourselves and and let us know about what you do with the comics and maybe a little bit of your relationship to to Halloween.

19
00:01:56,174 --> 00:02:02,155
Tim, since since you're joining us for the first time, can can you talk about your work? Yeah. So I'm

20
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:08,713
disney artist from Netherlands. I do other comments, but mostly this. I've been drawing since

21
00:02:09,332 --> 00:02:10,671
I've been drawing them since

22
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:29,985
two thousand and nine. And on and off again during my studies I kept kept trying the docs. And at the end, I thought that when I just make my job of it because... Yeah. It's it's what I do anyway. So I just kept on drawing and finally got accepted to draw comics for the touch done quickly. And

23
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,085
a few years ago, I actually got asked to do some digital findings for the new Ducktales,

24
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:41,754
Shell. So in some episodes, you'll see my work during flash.

25
00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:48,154
So that was really cool. I... Can I let me interrupt? Are those the the ones that are kinda

26
00:02:48,495 --> 00:02:53,526
stabilized to look like the the Barks, spot style paintings? Yeah. They

27
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:59,614
they're still in... The the characters look like the the those from the show. Right.

28
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:01,971
But the the colors and the

29
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:28,463
atmosphere supposed to be Barks like as as good as I could get it. So, yeah, That was are mine. And as really proud those. So... Yeah you should be proud of those. Those are those are really good. I I watch through the whole series which I felt was like pretty uneven but but that part was, like, some of the stand out. Yeah. That's awesome. Again, I I've I really enjoyed the, like, throwback that was in that series. And and you had some really

30
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,342
really neat art. I saw the the digital paintings that you mentioned online. You also did this really cool stamp series

31
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:44,705
for the for a Netherlands, like it sounds like a social welfare program, but it was really cool. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Those are our

32
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:46,700
indeed a good cause,

33
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:48,217
thing here and Netherlands.

34
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:49,614
Condition,

35
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:53,816
dating back to the ninety. Twenty something. But it's like

36
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,925
school children they go and sell these stamps

37
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,855
door by door the door.

38
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:11,103
And the money goes through a good cause and the good cause is different every year. But mostly it's in the the life of children, and they can trying to make them better. Right They they tried to partner up with a different

39
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:18,696
Ips. So this year was donald doc and I did draw them last year for another Ip, which is Tom,

40
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:20,774
but that's not known

41
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:30,125
of right. Yeah. I think I know my name. But I'm not really familiar with it. So you've been... You've been a Barks a long time Barks fan. Right? Yeah. I I have.

42
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:32,198
When was it kid, I

43
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,170
I had to do... I had to go into surgery for

44
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,250
little tubes in my ears or something.

45
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:50,368
But my parents stopped like oh this is my parents they felt sorry for me and they they said like, oh, let's just give them a subscription to donald doc extra. It's like the dollar weekly, but another monthly

46
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:52,283
publication. And

47
00:04:53,100 --> 00:05:00,297
with that subscription, I got a... I've always got a a gift. This was like an and Al I full of Barks

48
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:03,587
stories. And I immediately fell in love with those.

49
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:09,624
Nice. And and with Willie was actually one of those stories in that album. Excellent. And then

50
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:24,135
excited to to join join for that one. So... Yeah. I love it when people are really animated about specific story. Well well, thanks again for joining. And then how about over to your colleague? Right? You guys get to work together occasionally? And and?

51
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:42,789
Yeah. So this year, on the back of the the touch menu, there's every week there's a one pager. And for of twenty twenty two, we got asked to to draw them, but we don't collaborate on them with we withdraw them separately. But I also have another job month demo ten.

52
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:49,646
How does it He's been drawing like, two three quarters of them, and that's been drawing a quarter of them. But we also

53
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:51,774
we also we both draw,

54
00:05:52,512 --> 00:06:16,190
and we've also collaborated actually on a book and the bo where already split the drawing So where where I do the characters and into enjoy the background. So we also actually work together, but our these comments have been separate so far. So we always... Every time we have sketches we sent them to each other and give share feedback. I think there's even there's even one word... But I couldn't figure out some Barks so do like

55
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:19,402
yeah Imagine that. But that's awesome.

56
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:39,561
That's something we haven't mentioned, but we... We've now chatted for quite well already, I think. Maybe since I was fourteen or something like that, we were on a very dirty tall doc Disney covid four. So that's where we where we got to go each other and so we go back a long time we're both wanted two. Become economic artist

57
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:43,123
to schools that we about to do it. Otherwise, then we feel really bit.

58
00:06:44,575 --> 00:07:01,379
Yeah. That is great that you guys got to come up together. And now now I gather that they don't... They don't give you guys creative creator credit in the Netherlands. Right? Yeah. There's a tiny tiny thing taking in the front of the magazine or if you use magnifying glass, you can see a list of names.

59
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:06,610
The people then who got hired locally, so I think for example, stay have

60
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:14,385
economic and there those art aren't listed at all. And it also doesn't say who did what. So... Yeah. So you think it's alphabetically also. So it's.

61
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,966
Does that is that a source of friction I mean, think it depends on the art...

62
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:24,316
I think most people would refer to good cards, and I think

63
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:39,455
third I don't think it's really a source of friction though. There's even within the magazine, I think, they're still reconsider whether should put credit. I don't know if it's just... It's it's always been like this and it just never started doing it And you know reason. It's way certain

64
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:47,780
and right or to change it. But then I do notice when when it does get we published in different country and our name is there. I would like

65
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:50,647
Yeah. Do you feel a little exposed?

66
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:54,099
Yeah. Yeah. I mean I'm clearly yeah a rock story.

67
00:07:54,676 --> 00:07:55,190
The Us

68
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,890
of Publish one.

69
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:19,310
Well... It's... I think it's important to give creators their credit. But but I I understand feeling conflicted about it. Yeah what... It's it's it's mainly when... When I was reading as a kid, I wanted to know who what Because, of course, if you're a fan, you can tell the sales a apart with many it took me... Well basically to to funds

70
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:35,972
index which is also when I was fifteen or something but I whole childhood That definitely had favorite art and there was just no way of knowing who they were. So right person always did prefer. The one exception is called Barks because for Barks, they... Not when it's in the weekly magazine, but

71
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:44,559
nurses this whole that album that Tim talked about, then he got as a gift. That's this series which is the title is the best stories of the.

72
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:55,947
They're pretty clear about it and it's it's only Barks And with this Al series, I personally went I was little I had two or three of those albums, and I that the exact same one that didn't it. So I also...

73
00:08:56,364 --> 00:09:02,286
West is also one of the first going I I read must have been five years old or something. Nice

74
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,539
Good. I'm I'm glad this is one that has some some deep meaning to you guys.

75
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:12,825
But but what about Halloween it's self. Does that have any real meaning for you guys? Nope.

76
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:14,885
For me,

77
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:20,298
only recently, I think, it's it's starting to to come up here. And

78
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,415
I've been following some...

79
00:09:22,993 --> 00:09:27,545
I don't know if you know the angry video game or. Yeah. It's James Rolls. And

80
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:35,240
is Mike Met, and he's also a Barks fan. So Oh neat. What have Anyway, he he had this series where he he talked about

81
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:36,756
sp movies

82
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:44,944
from the thirties and then I Al all of stuff. And that kind of got me into the mood of of Halloween during this season. So Yeah. Recently

83
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:57,577
last five, six years, I've been getting into a bit more. Yeah. I mean, I also... I... Of course, halloween is because I have a lot of friends from the Us and I'm online a lot. Of course, it's impossible to miss Halloween regardless.

84
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:13,595
Right. But... But it's been big boy which American movies and American Tv shows. So they're going to know Al lean at some point. And I think I would send the process ten years or so. It's really become... It's very much become thing over here as well. But

85
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:29,761
still I've never been triggered treating or I don't... Still in my town at least and also I moved to amsterdam with there also never really saw that people decorating their houses. Is not a fitting is actually fine and I think about ten years ago. One single time

86
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:38,392
in our neighborhood to try to do an event and they might check or treating and kids came at the door and my mom opens and she didn't know what it want.

87
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:52,835
So I like entered it covered and found too Gan, because I knew what this one right. Literally didn't know what Halloween was ten years ago, so that kind of says a lot about how how big debt is culture. But Right. Well, As far as cultural

88
00:10:53,735 --> 00:11:15,665
exchanges, I think it's one of our better ones because it's it's a great holiday. So It'll be fun to hear your thoughts as the folks who don't, you know, observe the holiday directly, but but are very close aware of it. I looked up before before we started, I I was curious how Took or treat Barks come like was translate in the netherlands.

89
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:19,647
Yeah It's they call it for years fist, which means

90
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:20,883
spring festival,

91
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,517
which is not even a fitting

92
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:23,890
time.

93
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:29,119
They just came up with something random. So you guys as mentioned, we're we're covering a couple of

94
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:37,916
a couple of Halloween ten pages today. It part of the podcast is that I really like to do the big, like adventure stories chronological.

95
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:44,085
And so I just I can't really time things like trick treat to Halloween.

96
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:59,722
But that's why it's nice to cover the ten pages because I just felt. Free to kinda throw them in wherever and group them them dramatically. And and these are a couple of bark like better spooky stories. But but if you're looking for a real halloween

97
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:07,965
story, you know, you should check out Trick treat. It's it's not one of our best just because it was adapted from the cartoon

98
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:15,399
kind of hand adapted but it's it's still Al lot of fun. And and it's not without its like controversy

99
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:20,402
because apparently, it was, like too scary when barb initially turned it in.

100
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:34,779
So So they required him to, like, remove a lot of the original stuff that he'd added for its first printing. And And that left him needing to kinda make up this shortfall in pages.

101
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:38,288
And and so they asked him to do this additional

102
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:44,282
short story, which is the first one that we're gonna talk about called H goblins.

103
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:50,165
Apparently, Barks was not very pleased about today because I think they didn't even pay him for the pages

104
00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:54,725
That that that he was required to leave out. But

105
00:12:55,159 --> 00:13:05,764
to me, this one kind of... You can kinda tell that it's a little bit it feels a little bit half baked. Just a little bit weirder than your average Barks story.

106
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:08,960
But that it is fun. So a little bit of the background

107
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:11,536
because it was that replacement,

108
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:17,938
story. It was published in the same issue in the United States and donald dot twenty six.

109
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:29,676
Technically, it's a nine pager, not one of our ten page podcast stories but close enough. And it is this came out in November of nineteen fifty two was the cover date for it. And

110
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:32,226
I you mentioned Inducks

111
00:13:32,665 --> 00:13:33,724
earlier, Henri Eureka.

112
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:39,490
I use that site. Heavily, of course, it's where users can find information about the comics.

113
00:13:40,342 --> 00:14:01,021
And then review stories as well. So we'll we'll check in on the reviews. It is kind of a middle of the road ranked story on index it gets a seven point two out of ten, which is ranked one thousand two hundred and twenty out of all, like, forty two thousand stories on induction. And

114
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:03,813
there there are a few notable things

115
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:13,092
about this story. You guys... I'm Sure you guys noticed that it's one of Gyro very first appearances. Right? Yeah. When he didn't let me just weight.

116
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:16,423
He a little this first experience in the second.

117
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:22,576
But right or or he's wearing a fat suit or something. It's... Yeah. That's a very p

118
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:23,309
But

119
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:32,855
disclosure this is... So the other comment I'm very familiar with, but this was my first time reading this one. I actually didn't know there was another story where jo was still

120
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:43,730
I used. So that was also very jarring to read It is a little jarring to see pug like first character design version of Ji. This is his third appearance.

121
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:45,029
After...

122
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,560
Oh, well, Henri, you you and I talked about his first. Which was just a quick little cameo

123
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:51,438
in

124
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:56,565
Glad stone terrible secret. You can tell that he got rid of his Ticked after afterwards.

125
00:14:57,858 --> 00:14:58,358
Right.

126
00:14:59,257 --> 00:15:28,875
Yeah. That would have that would have helped him keep keep the weight off. Well, for whatever reason, Barks decided to make him more spelled And it's obviously been a very popular character design. And only other notable thing I noticed about this is that this is like it's a it's build Al a Donald Ducktales story, but it says feature Hue doing Louie, and really, they're they're the stars of this one. Yeah. And the version that the title doesn't even... The title is just the the title characters and here we do we all this mentioned.

127
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:34,285
Right. But what I what I wonder about this come again we'll will go through it

128
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:48,643
other than than the effect that he had to replace it It really felt to me this this story felt to me in a similar way, like, the the golden and Christmas tree, for example, it felt like somebody else gave him a promise that it that it had to involve goblins

129
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,600
because it feels a bit unrelated to the rest of the story. It could have been told without the government's in it probably.

130
00:15:55,054 --> 00:16:00,509
Exactly. But I mean I for that attention Severino. And Go has kind of a a weird

131
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:09,655
connotation in in in American English know that I could exactly define what Goblin means, but like, it doesn't feel like an invisible

132
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:16,425
presence. To me. Yeah So this this feels more like it would match the description of, like, fairies or

133
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:19,720
or something. Or the greenland things.

134
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:24,735
Yeah. Yeah. I I know this this god by kelly, I think, where there's

135
00:16:25,473 --> 00:16:33,296
on a plane and they do same but... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It definitely matches Kelly's ground ones. Those are fun little. Again.

136
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:34,809
Characters.

137
00:16:35,268 --> 00:16:37,207
Yeah. So... But... That's also...

138
00:16:37,546 --> 00:17:11,750
Because we we're... I think tim missed dutch one as well. So I'm I'm reading both the English introduction at the same time with the thing of go is that there's actually no direct translation for the word. So if you were translate to Dutch, they they use the word that you would use for ghost or genie in English? They're put them. It would... Then you would want to describe an actual goblin, like the the criteria would think of which just a different word than that. So like, it would maybe be like an an over or cobalt or something, but those would definitely not be invisible. So it's already right strange that the from the get goes so in dutch

139
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:14,305
Jar is basically talking about ghosts.

140
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:26,479
So yeah. That makes more sense. Wanted to add to henry like, like, Eagle spirits is is sort of the... Yeah. Yeah. I think any of those terms, like spirits or imp or even ghosts would have worked.

141
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:33,830
So so how about are you guys ready to go into the the kind meat of the story. Sure. Excellent. So I'm gonna

142
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,110
describe the action

143
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:43,958
on each page and give you guys a a break in between to kinda chime in with your thoughts. So this one, H Go

144
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:44,916
opens

145
00:17:45,335 --> 00:17:45,690
with

146
00:17:46,228 --> 00:17:48,402
the boys, the nephews and encountering

147
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:54,115
ji, and he's in the midst of kind of a a mini panic. He's telling them to get back

148
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,981
away from his... What's gonna turn out to be his workshop.

149
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:03,935
And he he has them duck behind the bank to to avoid any danger.

150
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:06,730
And he goes through this sequence

151
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:14,165
of, like, things to be careful of First, it's in English. It's flying hex rays,

152
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,599
and then

153
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:18,428
his electronic Adams sw

154
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:27,461
There there's some very neat are showing the effects of whatever this, like, weird experiment that's going on at his workshop

155
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:32,463
is... I I like the opening. I think it's pretty strong. It's very intriguing

156
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,479
And and by the end of the first page, He tells them it's safe to come out and see his new invention.

157
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:39,697
And he

158
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:45,414
describes it as his greatest aid to mankind's to date a goblin

159
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,564
foil. Tim. Yeah. It's it's it's fun he,

160
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:52,592
like he he he doesn't show what he's inventing. It's like

161
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,027
already in the unseen

162
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:57,593
world or something. So kinda sets it up for.

163
00:18:57,931 --> 00:18:59,269
So that's that's really cool.

164
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:14,962
What do you think Enrique? Yeah. It's it's a great setup up for it could even be the opening of a big adventure comic. But I like how he gets just right into the action. And right. And also also found interesting with Barks always does especially since Drivers you that he

165
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:25,095
driver comes running in and the nephew say, it's shi the fabulous and inventor. I just noticed in dutch version. They don't bother to say that and all they're just like, oh, it's dry.

166
00:19:25,615 --> 00:19:39,111
He's already so established at that point that they didn't feel the need to translate the that sentence. Right. But... It's it's definitely because it's a new character, but I feel Barks always tries to set up the characters in way, so you can

167
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:52,484
understand who they are without knowing the character. Right. He does some really... He does some quick signaling which I guess, was necessary since it's his like, second real story. Right. Onto to the to the next page,

168
00:19:53,203 --> 00:19:54,062
we go into

169
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:55,500
Gyro workshop

170
00:19:55,934 --> 00:20:02,412
and he's showing off the invention, which is kind of it's a really great panel, that first one

171
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:07,416
where where shows us the go foil. It's in the midst of this

172
00:20:07,995 --> 00:20:09,294
really wonderfully.

173
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:11,891
Illustrated range of gadget

174
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,894
that's that's labeled with some nice little site gag It's just suspended from a pole

175
00:20:18,392 --> 00:20:25,376
in in in the midst of all these raised blasting Al it. And, boy, Barks gives us some very quick x exposition

176
00:20:25,835 --> 00:20:27,934
about what this is. He Chi

177
00:20:28,273 --> 00:20:33,418
explains that it is the first ever device. Made to out Goblins,

178
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:41,250
and we get this very brief moment. This should be like a world view shattering moments. Right for for the Nephews.

179
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,530
This should call everything

180
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,290
about their existence and their theology and everything

181
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:57,197
into question, but but we got this goofy nine page gag story, so it's not what it's about. The Nephews take a quick moment to bog over the fact that there are really goblins

182
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,764
and ji explains... Yeah, they're just invisible

183
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:08,403
a cause Al all trouble. We get reminded that this is for Halloween by saying that that's when they work over overtime.

184
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:09,322
And

185
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:20,830
and and he shows off the invention to them and explains how it works. Henry, do you wanna tell us about the invention and how it works? Yeah. So it it looks like a little horseshoe,

186
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:25,707
but it basically is a almost like a magic ape ball for sure.

187
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:34,380
A horseshoe on a on a string with a little knob on it, and it shows a little... It has a little window in it that shows

188
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,640
text at the top.

189
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,475
And the device is going to

190
00:21:38,975 --> 00:21:53,200
give you advice of what to do when any trouble comes up. Yeah. I like I like the simplicity of the invention. What do you think tim about this page? Yeah. It it it also kinda reminds me of the the device itself, like

191
00:21:53,698 --> 00:21:55,635
if a toilet is occupied or not

192
00:21:57,944 --> 00:21:58,444
Really.

193
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:07,953
But it's it's fun. Yeah. The the expectation is really quick. And I really like the the panel with in the at the top, the first panel. The nephew looking really impressed.

194
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:15,665
Yeah. Right dumb expressions on their faces is yeah. You you see them making like,

195
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:16,605
like,

196
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:17,805
Yeah.

197
00:22:18,565 --> 00:22:20,245
That's that's what it's supposed to be.

198
00:22:21,219 --> 00:22:21,299
Yeah.

199
00:22:23,415 --> 00:22:30,461
So it this it was my first time reading this call. The second page baffled me indeed is worldview view shutter just

200
00:22:30,854 --> 00:22:34,031
drops the knowledge that all troubles are can't I.

201
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,589
I guess

202
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:41,160
we have everything that's better the world to blame on garland. And Jared just fixed it apparently.

203
00:22:41,700 --> 00:23:01,254
Right. This is definitely Barks doesn't care about Canon, but this story is about as non canonical as they come. It's funny guess it's also this is still when general mainly is about making useless inventions, I guess, but this seems it seems a very, like a very useful invention, but then in a very un unpredictable way solving your.

204
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:05,543
And and, of course, the fact that we never see the goblins or anything,

205
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,807
you know, it could very well just be this crack thing that's not doing anything.

206
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:20,193
Yeah. This is also why I was wondering when it was translated to Dutch if they even bother to mention the goblins because she could just... It could just be anything

207
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:22,045
you you don't see any

208
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:26,285
at least... Not yet. Right. It could be predict the future

209
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:32,765
itself. So On onto the third page, you know, the nephews are excited, they're bringing at home

210
00:23:33,422 --> 00:23:36,355
And and, you know, they're talking about how they can avoid anything

211
00:23:36,812 --> 00:23:37,312
unpleasant

212
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:38,325
hand.

213
00:23:39,065 --> 00:23:42,425
And and as they approach home very conveniently,

214
00:23:42,745 --> 00:23:46,500
Donald and Daisy are having a conversation And

215
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,780
Barks is gonna set this up by meeting

216
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,235
the Nephew needing to avoid their worst nightmare.

217
00:23:53,933 --> 00:24:06,190
And and what is a little boy's worst nightmare in the nine... In the nineteen fifties, it's it's being around little girls. This is the part of the story where we get some some pretty weird gender politics

218
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:07,326
thrown in here.

219
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:09,502
Because Daisy is telling

220
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:10,375
Donald,

221
00:24:10,735 --> 00:24:16,315
she wants the boys available to dance with the little girls at her afternoon

222
00:24:16,775 --> 00:24:17,095
already.

223
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,170
And and they describe it as the most horrible torture

224
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,890
boy can endure. Mh I'm gonna disagree, honestly.

225
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,967
I I I would have been right there with them at that time. It's just... I I never

226
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:32,844
experienced

227
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,318
anyone basically

228
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:47,903
you know, telling me. Oh, your job this this afternoon is kinda dance with little girls It's... Yeah. That's a weird shoe horn setup. Yeah. It's it's it's basically adults worst nightmare all over again only the setup is even stranger air. Yeah.

229
00:24:48,662 --> 00:24:51,575
But I'm thinking fifties people were this cruel two points.

230
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:52,870
Right.

231
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,730
You're a girl's part to do this? Right.

232
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,705
And and then this the page closes out with one of the nephews making a pretty cool expression

233
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:09,005
saying that it's lucky for them, They've got this goblin foil. Any other thoughts on this one, Tim. Mh.

234
00:25:09,938 --> 00:25:13,109
Yeah. I'm also right there with them in nineteen nineties.

235
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,741
Yeah. I wonder how it is...

236
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:20,621
No. It's it's really great that that that's the most horrible thing they can enjoy

237
00:25:21,277 --> 00:25:25,965
super funny. They could take for time. They could fix world hunger with this

238
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:28,535
right.

239
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:29,809
So

240
00:25:30,426 --> 00:25:32,084
the next the next sequence

241
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:40,200
it gets pretty invent here. Right? It if you ignore the fact that this is all being caused by invisible goblins.

242
00:25:40,696 --> 00:25:44,701
I like this this sequence here where they they take the

243
00:25:45,117 --> 00:25:48,090
advice of the foil, which says to go far away.

244
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,010
I'm we're gonna say, it's not the most innovative advice ever.

245
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,230
Stupid

246
00:25:54,785 --> 00:25:59,285
but they decide they opt to go to Grandma Inducks farm and

247
00:25:59,705 --> 00:26:05,420
and very predictably the this feels you guys like kind of the Gladstone donald mh sequences.

248
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,020
Right? Where where his lock is kind of the foil. But

249
00:26:11,055 --> 00:26:15,275
Donald that turns out is gonna head to grandma's laws as well to harvest some comp.

250
00:26:15,895 --> 00:26:23,439
And by the time they've walked five miles to get out there. Donald is meeting in them. And. I guess Donald went by com.

251
00:26:23,857 --> 00:26:31,789
Right. Probably. I like how the advice is just go far away and then nephew you say sounds like good sensible device.

252
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:32,725
Which.

253
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,062
Which is pretty

254
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:45,075
self aware, but Yeah. This again, this this page, like you said, it it it sounds almost like a glad slow story and I don't know if if if Barks ever said anything about this

255
00:26:45,732 --> 00:27:01,041
specifically, but it still feels to me like, he maybe had this idea for a different comic and that he maybe she wanted in to work with goldman. It it it feels like it could been an interesting glad comic but then

256
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:11,068
he he ended up using it with a with the kind of tacked on halloween halloween fee. Right. But I'm not sure, of course, maybe I'm I'm doing it with this service thinking this but.

257
00:27:12,643 --> 00:27:15,417
Yeah. I remember reading a little bit about it

258
00:27:15,755 --> 00:27:25,905
when I was doing the background for trip treat. I didn't really review that. I I think as I recall, he just kinda slapped it together. Mh. Which which it feels like

259
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:27,800
And the bills need to be paid

260
00:27:28,578 --> 00:27:29,078
Yes

261
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:31,092
I can understand businesses is this.

262
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:32,789
For a

263
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:37,830
the story that slept together, it's still good reading. I mean, Yeah. It's very yesterday.

264
00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:39,105
Absolutely.

265
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,659
And this

266
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:41,434
Go ahead.

267
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:43,545
I of the tech the textbook.

268
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:54,373
That says if goblins could be that easily, there'd be no fun in everything around. Right. Yeah. It feels like Bark sometimes has the most fun. In his text boxes.

269
00:27:55,229 --> 00:27:55,729
So

270
00:27:56,186 --> 00:28:11,970
it proceeds in this sequence where they're gonna go through and and do their best to stay one step ahead. So the next time they spin the dial, the foil tells them to climb a tree. Mh It's really appealing looking Apple tree that they climb.

271
00:28:12,464 --> 00:28:14,160
And and start picking an apple

272
00:28:14,697 --> 00:28:15,955
from. And

273
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,111
while

274
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:24,266
while they're doing this, Donald is complaining about the dr of Harvey and and piling some pun.

275
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:27,579
And he decides that he's gonna take a

276
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:33,504
rest under under that Apple tree and join apple. And so he just absolutely

277
00:28:33,924 --> 00:28:35,784
weighs on the Apple tree

278
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:39,644
with a with a club or a branch. And as he says,

279
00:28:40,244 --> 00:28:44,746
well quite a harvest as a bunch of apples, but also the nephews

280
00:28:45,401 --> 00:28:46,517
fall right on out.

281
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:50,023
Yeah. And what way to to pick an up just

282
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:51,301
where want.

283
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,976
Right. I guess is too sure to to but one.

284
00:28:56,849 --> 00:29:02,224
And and we get... We get next a brisk little sequence that's basically the Nephews

285
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:04,022
consulting

286
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:05,141
the

287
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,020
foil

288
00:29:06,534 --> 00:29:16,159
And they also comment that only a goblin could give him such speed. So they've just totally bought into this whole universe now. Yeah. They basically became hyper religious

289
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:17,998
on this.

290
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:20,236
Right. Everything. Everything

291
00:29:20,735 --> 00:29:22,213
is caused by goblins ones.

292
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:34,346
It it is pretty weird you guys, they're usually so national. So Barks really has to... It's it's it's pretty strange. Right? They're they're usually such rational.

293
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:35,319
Characters.

294
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:40,424
But but we know that we've talked about this Al lot on the podcast. Barks is very elastic

295
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:42,098
and he makes his characters

296
00:29:42,436 --> 00:29:44,430
be what they need to be in a given story...

297
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,065
Well not like totally diver,

298
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:49,284
I think, from their their true nature.

299
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:54,918
So the goblins ones, the goblin foil tells them to plead from mercy egg.

300
00:29:55,972 --> 00:30:01,612
And he puts them... He draws them in a pretty great pose of application and they beg

301
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:04,140
for for it. And and Donald,

302
00:30:05,117 --> 00:30:07,014
Donald Ac is

303
00:30:07,591 --> 00:30:25,337
Henry good you wanna tell us about the bargain, he makes with them. So he says, I'll make you a deal. You follow the pumpkin. But if you carve so much Al one face and one pumpkin, you go right that today's and Of course, this is also one of those states that if you don't know what Halloween, this makes zero sense.

304
00:30:26,214 --> 00:30:40,511
I'm not he would even... Why he would even assume they would do that. Actually in no dutch version, he just does if you make a game out of this, I'll send you right back. So they didn't translate that directly. But yeah. The next the net look adorable as he Barks down.

305
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:47,687
He he apparently does... He doesn't identify expectations of the nephews that he already expects to carve the pumpkin

306
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:53,958
they were told to stick. Right. I like the idea that they're just gonna be so overcome with the urge

307
00:30:54,334 --> 00:31:00,400
to car pumpkin. Have you guys several car of the pumpkin? No. I I want to do it for years already. But

308
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:02,557
I so hard to buy pumpkin

309
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:15,077
to like that. So I'm here to tell you as as a parent of young kids, and I've been through this now. I'm going on my my third kid it's actually really super unpleasant

310
00:31:15,454 --> 00:31:16,552
to carnival pumpkin

311
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:21,856
because like, you have to clean it out and it's it takes a long time

312
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:27,123
And it's it's it's like the sw vegetable, I guess they're technically a fruit.

313
00:31:28,242 --> 00:31:29,820
It's the slim

314
00:31:30,853 --> 00:31:38,075
inside So, like, it really does fall apart. But but... Yeah. You you're not gonna just sit there and carve it randomly.

315
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:42,137
Yeah. And of course, if... If you're Al artist, you have to make really good focus.

316
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:44,329
Right. You can't get him away

317
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:54,153
yeah. Hey, Tim. Do you wanna tell us about this next sequence. I I think this is one of the highlights of the story. I always I always like the best as a kid. Yeah. So so the nephews

318
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:58,398
are gru like they have to get out of this gem.

319
00:31:58,896 --> 00:32:01,713
This this deal that they made with An macdonald. And

320
00:32:02,132 --> 00:32:03,884
it kind of feels like

321
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:07,076
their own fault, all of this stuff, but

322
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:08,689
that's just me. Right.

323
00:32:09,486 --> 00:32:12,876
So the they spin the dial and it says just speak away.

324
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:14,549
And

325
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:21,901
Al the kids sneak away, donald throws another pumpkin on the pile based been different been building. And

326
00:32:22,813 --> 00:32:23,792
three of the pumpkins

327
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:26,383
fall on top of

328
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:31,979
three space or three tools. Mh. And and also on top of the fence, And

329
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:33,814
somehow those

330
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:35,051
those

331
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:38,482
land on the nephew heads. And

332
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:41,172
being encouraged by those tools in this.

333
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,410
And

334
00:32:42,949 --> 00:32:45,646
nobody but a government could have cleaned up this catastrophe.

335
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:56,035
And immediately Donald is there, of course. Right. Yeah. And he catches them red handed so he believes I don't know why they would have smashed the pumpkins

336
00:32:56,535 --> 00:32:57,815
onto their own heads.

337
00:32:58,455 --> 00:33:00,595
Yeah But of course, there's no other

338
00:33:01,055 --> 00:33:03,035
explanation. They can't blame it on Goblins.

339
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:03,850
It's

340
00:33:04,388 --> 00:33:13,835
It's a very goofy sequence, but... But it's fine. It's one of those chains of events that bart me sometimes. That's that's neat. Yeah. It feels like a

341
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:18,274
it feels like it went back to his story boarding days for the sequence would've

342
00:33:18,654 --> 00:33:22,289
creating Inducks correct yeah. But I I love how how how it just

343
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:27,038
They barely sneak away of quickly, which is better terrible advice.

344
00:33:27,854 --> 00:33:37,036
This takeaways are quickly, you just froze donald first pumpkin Al an empty bowel. And the the this very first part is they went to car pumpkins inside that.

345
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:41,997
Right. So it's like a as though it's like a drug habit of theirs or something.

346
00:33:42,494 --> 00:33:55,236
Yeah. I could just hear Car and Donald saying in his voice like, so I So Yeah. Yeah. So yeah I wouldn't be... Yeah. We don't get a lot of that. So from the comics, but it's ever present go to.

347
00:33:56,289 --> 00:34:00,665
So you know, the sequence goes into the nephews fleeing again.

348
00:34:01,044 --> 00:34:01,544
And

349
00:34:01,883 --> 00:34:06,635
while while their uncle is tangled up, in what seems to be.

350
00:34:07,455 --> 00:34:11,795
They get their last piece of advice spinning the dial they're told to hide

351
00:34:12,269 --> 00:34:15,286
and they come across a very large pumpkin,

352
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:30,410
which is the only place and they need to get inside. And again, you guys this It's cartoon logic so that's fine. But even even as a silly eight or nine year old, I was like, wait a minute. I've carved a pumpkin before

353
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:39,921
I know that it would take hours to get the guts out of that to make room to actually hide in there. And and the predictable thing happens,

354
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:41,295
in that

355
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:49,315
Donald has to give up chasing them, and we get our our brief appearance from grandma dot. I don't get to talk about her that often you guys.

356
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,270
Who says

357
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:58,430
that Daisy phone requesting a pumpkin for her party and wouldn't you know it, Donald is gonna get that big

358
00:34:58,983 --> 00:35:00,200
show pumpkin.

359
00:35:00,617 --> 00:35:03,587
I'm gonna see this becomes more ridiculous of.

360
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:05,676
Right.

361
00:35:06,568 --> 00:35:16,876
I I wonder if the if the government folder is actually just reading the Nephew spots because all the advice is it gives basically the most basic first thought you would have a job.

362
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:18,852
I

363
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:21,065
way, hide yeah.

364
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,740
Exactly. And it feels like

365
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:34,882
definitely feels like none of this would have happened if they hadn't, like that they were... That they called the attention of the Goblins something who usually wouldn't have like, honed in on this.

366
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:40,487
And and the next sequence, the the last page or so of the story

367
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,380
is...

368
00:35:43,234 --> 00:35:44,293
It's very goofy.

369
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:48,163
Daisy at at Daisy party, she has hired

370
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:49,001
a

371
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:51,115
a swords man named

372
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:56,795
Lab blade who's gonna show... Demonstrate how to carve a face with a saver.

373
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,667
I do love his, like, ridiculous

374
00:36:00,286 --> 00:36:02,383
french. I don't know how they

375
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:04,315
if they convey that

376
00:36:04,734 --> 00:36:10,942
in the Dutch one or anything. But but he's ridiculously act accent here. He says voila

377
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,339
with z

378
00:36:12,757 --> 00:36:13,257
category

379
00:36:13,596 --> 00:36:13,910
trust

380
00:36:14,568 --> 00:36:16,284
of the eye to share.

381
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:18,838
Christmas.

382
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,333
U. I say near nearly die.

383
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:21,990
Right.

384
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:26,980
This is honestly as one most dangerous situations than nephews have ever been in.

385
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:32,069
How about you guys did do either of you have the Dutch to see what

386
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:33,508
how that was translated.

387
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:36,165
He he doesn't doesn't just an accent.

388
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:37,903
Okay. No.

389
00:36:38,402 --> 00:36:40,101
He does... He does say unnecessary

390
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,950
French words. Because he's called muscular

391
00:36:43,447 --> 00:36:43,947
lam.

392
00:36:44,644 --> 00:36:46,380
Okay. And he says

393
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:47,338
in

394
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:48,670
I'm

395
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,030
I.

396
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,030
Yeah. But

397
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,910
and yeah, he's just

398
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:58,405
slicing through the pump and and as he's about to finish it up, the Nephews

399
00:36:59,145 --> 00:37:08,741
are forced to use their... Their handy nineteen fifties era pocket knives that every child, every boy at least has to carve their way out.

400
00:37:09,378 --> 00:37:11,445
And they're... They keep them in their invisible pens

401
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,883
Right. And and he

402
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:17,160
sa blue. Z pumpkin was populated.

403
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:18,278
And

404
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:19,157
Henri

405
00:37:19,736 --> 00:37:23,603
tell us about the, like, closing of the story with the little girls and everything.

406
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:26,833
Yeah. So the girls shot. Oh, good goody.

407
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:37,097
The nephew look absolutely petri wine just get I don't know how many girls had Barks, seven or eight. They've just run that So there's more girls and boys, so that's already

408
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:39,548
can only imagine what Barks they have to.

409
00:37:39,987 --> 00:37:44,532
And it follows with one of the greatest panels I've everything seen after the nephew.

410
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:53,004
It says Al evening chad fall. Oh, woah, woah, what a great gala afternoon is donald. And the nephews has walk in front of him. Just looking...

411
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:54,838
I've never seen in any

412
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:55,973
Right.

413
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,046
Expressions of murder.

414
00:37:58,539 --> 00:37:59,438
In their eyes.

415
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:12,421
I'm I'm at least happy that I would be worried for them that they would be covered in in lipstick or something. That's right. Thankfully. I they seem to have survived okay. It's just their dignity me that's got shutters.

416
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,200
Right.

417
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:16,057
And and we get one of those classic

418
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,336
violence.

419
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:18,868
Gag endings

420
00:38:19,325 --> 00:38:19,825
where

421
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,957
where he asked them,

422
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:27,461
are you tired, aren't you gonna go home Donald says and they say not yet on donald.

423
00:38:28,194 --> 00:38:35,146
Right now, we're gonna see a man about an invention and they they've gotten some large plugs from a wood pile.

424
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:39,051
And there's a very convenient sign gyro gear and

425
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:49,165
that way. As they strive off to to whale upon him. So pretty large clips do. It's Yeah. Yeah. It's gonna be brutal. Maybe

426
00:38:49,665 --> 00:38:51,665
that's how he lost that way.

427
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:54,460
During his recovery peter

428
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,401
yeah. He had he wife he ended up in hospital for seven months cent.

429
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,540
Right.

430
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,833
Just so So you guys that's H Goblins.

431
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:13,189
I guess it should really be H gear loose by the end there. But it We haven't been two kinds to the story, but it does have some really fun sequences,

432
00:39:13,766 --> 00:39:24,786
some nice expressive character art do you think, Tim? Yeah. As a whole, I I still like it a lot. It I I remember it for reading it from when I was a kid. So it it stuck with me.

433
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,913
There's a lot of Barks stories do, but I think the fact that that Al kid, I really didn't want to dance with those.

434
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,863
Anyone from that You found available?

435
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:36,321
Yeah.

436
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,977
I still don't like the bones. But

437
00:39:39,315 --> 00:39:39,815
So...

438
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:43,207
Yeah. I really stuck stuck chord with me as a kid and

439
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,848
I think it it might have done with lots of kids Barks then. So it is really these these ridiculous situations

440
00:39:50,545 --> 00:40:02,286
that make a fun story. Otherwise, probably would have been a bit boring. Yeah. What do you... What do you think, En? Yeah. So, I mean, the story in in most part, it doesn't really make sense, and it aged forty, but it's very fun.

441
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:07,869
So I like it because if I laugh what I'm reading a callback like, I usually, like it so

442
00:40:08,247 --> 00:40:13,391
yeah. It's it just... Definitely, like I said, it feels you can you can kind of... It's not

443
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:36,757
bell structured that it's now as well structured just most of but what you would expect from from Barks, but nonetheless, it's has a lot of really funny moments and then the expressions are great. So I would still consider it a very enjoyable call. Yeah. You're totally right about those expressions, it's it's one of the things that I love doing about the podcast is that it forces me to like pay such careful attention

444
00:40:37,110 --> 00:41:29,977
to each panel that I find all these great expressions like those murder faces that, you know, I I may not have fully appreciated it. Just stewart during a regular read through. So that there's some really fun sequences here. It's just the whole... I do find it off putting how we're just supposed to accept the invisible god ones for it. It's it's a ridiculous story. Yeah. And gyro doesn't doesn't daryl a lot if it things in here that if I would look at the story very critically, I would consider not very good stories I think, but I guess he had a good experience for it. Right. Yeah. That... It's weird how gerald basically doesn't return and the goblins are... I wonder if they're even real one when I was reading it kept expecting to either see something or that it gets acknowledged that that the invention doesn't work or that they're not real, but it just... It's it just feels like a sequence of events. That is enjoyable. So

445
00:41:30,634 --> 00:41:57,404
I wouldn't consider it a great story, but it's it's it's already fun reads. It is. That's very entertaining. And what you said about the the presence in the panels. So well I hadn't read this comment before a lot of these Barks panels are they've been reused out of contact so often in the Dutch magazine that several of these panels are drawings I've seen tons of times already. So it's funny to find see them in the context of the comment you're from. Yeah. Bet. That would be cool.

446
00:41:57,941 --> 00:42:05,957
Yeah. How how about you guys any any favorite panels that you'd like to really highlight? That that one from that los page that we just mentioned with the Nephew looking

447
00:42:06,335 --> 00:42:12,463
Right. Mh Angry. Yeah. I agree. I I think that's gotta be the winner as far as the expressive

448
00:42:12,936 --> 00:42:24,451
I really did like Gyro rose workshop and the and the just crazy elaborate equipment. Yeah. And I wonder if this is the it's is the first time you see his workshop on the inside? I think so because

449
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,091
he's never in it in the

450
00:42:29,686 --> 00:42:33,486
think box story. He's they're they're outside and out about.

451
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:38,366
Yeah. So I think it's actually the first the first time you see da workshop.

452
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:44,981
Yeah. Way, it's it's funny. I just I just thought about this actually that there's no door or wall.

453
00:42:46,396 --> 00:43:03,156
His not. Just one realize. Yeah. So so I assume for safety. Yeah. So the panel... I mean, I think it's just the storytelling so he wants to have them running towards his workshop. So he's he's showing them entering the workshop. But because it's difficult to show them entering

454
00:43:03,576 --> 00:43:10,889
all these characters entering through a door, I think he just didn't her, but he just saves it away. You don't but lightning

455
00:43:11,306 --> 00:43:12,404
that is lightning

456
00:43:12,742 --> 00:43:16,846
had to be outside. So it's sort of... Yeah true. Right. I wonder right. Mh

457
00:43:17,505 --> 00:43:18,124
But this

458
00:43:18,822 --> 00:43:22,933
that you don't think about until you draw yourself or when you start paying this,

459
00:43:23,571 --> 00:43:25,947
ten many other panels you wanted to highlight

460
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,357
Yeah For me the one Donald

461
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:31,829
striking the three with the with the club is is like

462
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:33,625
it's really funny to me.

463
00:43:34,082 --> 00:43:36,554
Oh, yeah. Now that the threes the

464
00:43:37,253 --> 00:43:37,753
sp.

465
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:38,372
Yeah.

466
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:44,346
Right. So it's really yeah yeah. And the one with the Nephews

467
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,117
and they after dance with the girls when they're I was pumpkin

468
00:43:49,135 --> 00:43:53,011
I really love those expressions like... Yeah. Yep red red on their faces.

469
00:43:53,746 --> 00:43:54,846
Just rev.

470
00:43:55,346 --> 00:44:05,860
Yeah. Alright. Well, you guys that that was really good that that's a fun story at least to have talked about. But why don't we transition to the the kind of the Show story?

471
00:44:06,618 --> 00:44:11,243
And, you know, this one is, like, not really technically a Halloween

472
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:12,301
story.

473
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:19,791
It's just it's just spooky. Right? I mean, the the the creature is meant to be like a jack Gladstone.

474
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:20,491
So

475
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:25,531
we're we're shoe horn this in a little bit. Yeah. And well well

476
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:30,193
Hell hello too well, Hello isn't really... Wasn't really a comics, of course.

477
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:42,369
They they would make themed negatives with spooky stuff. So in that regard, in a Dutch magazine this would fit right in with the other ones. Right. It fits very nicely within our October theme.

478
00:44:43,007 --> 00:44:45,041
And then, you know, it just feels very seasonal.

479
00:44:45,376 --> 00:44:47,512
Two. So you guys were gonna

480
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:56,943
proceed to talk about our kinda main feature story with steve Willie. This one is published in Walt Disney comments and Number one hundred and fifty nine.

481
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:07,020
About a year later, the cover date was December of nineteen fifty three, This is a true ten pager, and this one's rated quite a bit better on Inducks.

482
00:45:07,777 --> 00:45:14,953
It's not like a super highly rated one but as well regarding It's it's ranked four hundred and eleven right now,

483
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:23,152
which is good for a seven point four. And if you kinda break out all of the ten pages as I've done

484
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:26,948
and put them on a spreadsheet, you can tell that it's in the eighteenth

485
00:45:27,327 --> 00:45:27,827
percentile.

486
00:45:28,221 --> 00:45:38,516
Of ten pager. So so pretty pretty well regarded, you guys I I have to think that most of that is is because people remember the cr sure.

487
00:45:38,894 --> 00:45:47,031
Whiskey Willie himself. Even though he's not like a really big part of this story, he's just so darn like, creepy

488
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,428
and goofy feet and memorable

489
00:45:50,007 --> 00:45:50,247
altogether.

490
00:45:50,886 --> 00:45:51,386
Cute.

491
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,943
Yeah. But guess this is one of those...

492
00:45:54,322 --> 00:46:08,907
I have to say so like I mentioned, this is one of the first Barks comments I read, and I hadn't read it in years, and I forgot what the story was even about, but I definitely remember I remember this all these panels with really in it and

493
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,386
so you can definitely

494
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:21,216
say that he's very... Yeah. This this panel defend at Al. See that they're very memorable and all the stuff that's happening to Donald does memorable both and I forgot that it was Scrooge to this too.

495
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:28,828
Yeah. He's kind of... Tim, he's kinda incidental to the story itself. Right? Yeah. That's that's true.

496
00:46:29,564 --> 00:46:31,355
It's it's like the final

497
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:39,508
things groups does to to to his cause. But the story is isn't titled with the Willy or anything. As far as I can tell in the original

498
00:46:40,046 --> 00:46:51,141
application. So so maybe the fan just named it doctor him because it's such a striking character. Yeah. Because in the dutch one that it actually has a title and the title is

499
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,660
where, although

500
00:46:53,038 --> 00:46:55,036
dutch is done the bowel list.

501
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,765
Which us a great name. Right.

502
00:46:58,803 --> 00:47:03,694
Most of these have been, you know, un titled originally. And at some point, they just

503
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:07,615
them I know that this one was originally also called...

504
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:11,817
Oh, I can't remember. Had some other name to Iowa.

505
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:14,571
But, yeah. It's

506
00:47:15,111 --> 00:47:18,131
he he's what stands out. He's what people remember.

507
00:47:18,431 --> 00:47:18,931
So

508
00:47:19,325 --> 00:47:29,715
and this is technically a donald versus Scrooge story, which is easy to forget. It it also means that this one sometimes gets printed and while disney comics and stories,

509
00:47:30,154 --> 00:47:32,468
sometimes in an uncle Scrooge in the Us,

510
00:47:33,106 --> 00:47:44,041
it it fits in a couple of places. Yeah. And this is definitely one of those stories where when I saw Ducktales is kid in the nineteenth I always... Even when I was very young, I thought screw

511
00:47:44,341 --> 00:47:46,821
strange because it was so nice and the soft.

512
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:51,521
But after when you read... If this is one of the first Scrooge stories you ever read that

513
00:47:52,115 --> 00:47:54,567
you you get to see the worst of scrubs, basically.

514
00:47:55,501 --> 00:48:04,783
Yeah. He's just... Huey, just her. Yeah. He's he's a real jerk. And that's fine. Huey, he's an outright villain in this one. Which which I enjoy. So...

515
00:48:05,558 --> 00:48:07,472
Yeah. Thank. It can be fun.

516
00:48:08,843 --> 00:48:24,942
You you have to read the stories as though every issue that, you know, they don't relate to each other. Yeah. I... Did you still do you still do the sequence where you reach different titles from different countries? Or... I do. But sometimes I just plain forget.

517
00:48:26,274 --> 00:48:29,129
So is is there a title that you noticed

518
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:57,366
that you were animated by Henri? I see that the German, the German one is it's slight like. Which just means... Inducks should we transfer to Camp, but, like, two... It's two brewster that are fighting so you can imagine what what it means And let's say. And the this the spanish title seems to be specific. But you speak some Spanish. Right? Yeah. I alright. So, yeah, the Spanish title, it says... Yeah. I see that the Spanish one and

519
00:48:58,485 --> 00:48:59,545
And the Fuego

520
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:01,922
means the game is between fools.

521
00:49:02,496 --> 00:49:06,192
So when I when I see the Danish one, one title,

522
00:49:06,531 --> 00:49:16,666
I can absolutely not pronounce this thin lit month, which I guess means something like the the wheel of the wrist. But then the other one another side was moses

523
00:49:17,123 --> 00:49:17,623
motion.

524
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:24,842
So I'm gonna guess that most of this is main it's really name. And almost and probably means from this one. Nice.

525
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:28,459
Tim, do you wanna mention any of them? Yeah either?

526
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:30,417
The belgian one is really

527
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:34,987
really on the nose, I think is is just Donald sells house. That's.

528
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:42,496
But yeah. It's also the the Belgian french one is also mcdonald self house in Australia it was one called moving days.

529
00:49:44,057 --> 00:50:08,480
Yeah. That's the original title. The the the title that it used to have in, you know, in the Us. It's pretty pretty bland. Yeah. And it's sweden. It's her still Al, probably house for sale or something. That's what it sounds like. Yeah. I do like his his Dutch name Al lot doing deck val lift. It's a nice alteration. But derek is just derek, basically. And so it's like thin derek willow.

530
00:50:08,937 --> 00:50:10,372
It's into keeping with Barks

531
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:13,682
for Yeah. Or whiskey Willy.

532
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:14,636
So,

533
00:50:15,536 --> 00:50:20,016
yeah, let's get let's get on into the story and again, break in where appropriate.

534
00:50:20,376 --> 00:50:24,925
We get a really good setup This is one of those kind of classic

535
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:25,802
ty

536
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:30,468
against the little guy stories that you see in a lot of media

537
00:50:31,205 --> 00:50:33,355
where someone wants to buy

538
00:50:33,693 --> 00:50:39,060
a piece of property. In this case, Uncle Scrooge wants to buy Donald house

539
00:50:39,518 --> 00:50:40,018
for

540
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:49,376
his new... For his new widget factory, I think he's gonna say at some point in the story. But but initially, as he's handling with Donald, he's

541
00:50:49,956 --> 00:50:51,736
he doesn't want to

542
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:57,816
admit. He's saying the the city is gonna develop this part into a model district

543
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:01,025
And and he's given Donald this

544
00:51:01,362 --> 00:51:13,536
pretty insulting low offer. But when I looked at up two thousand bucks is what he offers him, which That that was like the price of a medium home in the Us about a decade and the half

545
00:51:14,076 --> 00:51:17,228
before. Is what I found looking up inflation.

546
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:20,264
I Barks the worst corner of Inducks burger.

547
00:51:20,763 --> 00:51:21,263
Right

548
00:51:22,816 --> 00:51:25,316
And and the page closes out by

549
00:51:25,656 --> 00:51:26,156
saying,

550
00:51:26,736 --> 00:51:44,138
by one of the nephew wondering why Scrooge On ridge wants this place. And Donald stubborn saying it doesn't matter. He isn't gonna get it at his price. What, you guys think it's a it's a pretty strong setup. Yeah. It is. And I I really like the the the way Scrooge like, tries to

551
00:51:44,595 --> 00:51:46,091
say he wants to donate.

552
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,218
It's the development

553
00:51:48,994 --> 00:51:51,449
great expression. Yeah. Yeah. But it

554
00:51:52,105 --> 00:51:54,081
does a really poor job of it the

555
00:51:55,575 --> 00:52:00,597
starts out by lying he just tries to buy our Nephew House lying to right.

556
00:52:01,055 --> 00:52:16,928
Yeah. It's horrible. And and s state doc... I love how they on the first panel, they're kind of bent over two our etcetera and and the second battle, you see a a long shot where you see the whole house and you can just see that if you look pretty closely the Nephew sitting on the fence, so they're just watching

557
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,045
Al domino's

558
00:52:18,543 --> 00:52:21,517
discussing this. But Barks str great arguments.

559
00:52:22,029 --> 00:52:28,524
Yeah. I love... I love seeing two people at odds. They're just... It's so amusing when Barks draws them.

560
00:52:29,536 --> 00:52:32,776
So on the next page, we get a little bit of Scrooge

561
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:36,636
motivations. We learned that in fact, it is that this will

562
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,723
hold up plans for his new Gizmo factory

563
00:52:40,419 --> 00:52:49,236
because he can't buy the land and he emails over Al he's looking at a map of the area. He says that he's bought up all the other places around donald

564
00:52:49,616 --> 00:52:54,736
for half what they worth, but that Donald insists on more than a fair price.

565
00:52:56,027 --> 00:52:57,923
And so far fair.

566
00:52:58,659 --> 00:52:59,376
Right. Yeah.

567
00:53:00,572 --> 00:53:07,116
I I do love this part of you guys. He he uses an old style intercom to tell his clerk jeans.

568
00:53:08,336 --> 00:53:11,276
He asks them to bring in his book of dia volatile

569
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:12,611
strat.

570
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:16,451
And Tim, do you wanna tell us

571
00:53:17,191 --> 00:53:17,691
about...

572
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:21,560
Did just talk about that panel where he's reading through the book.

573
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:30,099
Scrooge is like reading a book and he says ways to make people sell homes, which is a apparently a chapter and dialogue

574
00:53:30,798 --> 00:53:32,017
lakes, thurman.

575
00:53:32,556 --> 00:53:33,056
About.

576
00:53:33,395 --> 00:53:33,895
So

577
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:36,951
you tell us about the first scheme, please.

578
00:53:37,844 --> 00:53:39,182
So the next day,

579
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,188
one of the nephews comes up to Donald and says, if he noticed the... We have rats in the house.

580
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,953
There's this, like I think when or something red Inducks

581
00:53:49,432 --> 00:53:50,810
and donald is like.

582
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:57,790
Outcome come we have so many suddenly. And then there's somebody at the door not And it's the city red inspector.

583
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:05,967
This rats, it will have to be torn down. And it's it's like this really goofy guy with the the str Barks, and

584
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,674
I think some pillow is in his

585
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:11,348
his jacket, and

586
00:54:11,725 --> 00:54:16,645
it's pretty clear it's it's on group. Is a classic Barks disguise. Yeah.

587
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:22,608
Yeah. I just tied them up to a face or something Yeah. And I wonder if if Donald

588
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:35,877
can't tell if it's him or not. I don't think so. My read of it is that he's completely fooled. Okay But the reader still gets to see the the specs and the the glasses and so it's right. Pretty clear obviously obvious. Very obviously.

589
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:38,646
And donald this reading, walt disney stuff.

590
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:47,734
Oh, yeah. That's a a fun catch. What is reading in the the dutch version... And then that one he's reading a job the,

591
00:54:48,111 --> 00:55:02,647
which is the name. It's the name of the... There's dutch Disney magazine. And there's a page with sent jokes and kids. Oh, nice. Apparently what three. See. That's fun. Pretty same jokes for. Oh, the the fake inspector,

592
00:55:03,024 --> 00:55:05,516
you know, says I... I'm also an

593
00:55:06,545 --> 00:55:07,404
and he

594
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:11,191
khan donald into offering to spread some

595
00:55:11,647 --> 00:55:12,147
repel

596
00:55:12,644 --> 00:55:17,391
around to drive away the rats. And screws thinks to himself that it's actually

597
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,571
sku oil,

598
00:55:19,331 --> 00:55:32,308
which is something I've never encountered in real life, but I hear about these comments all the time. Yeah. I wonder if that's... I don't think that's actually something you can buy but is the worst imagine snow. Right. And I I love

599
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:34,842
Al pages already just so silly.

600
00:55:35,361 --> 00:55:48,969
Screen looks silly, and he says I do wonder if Donald I wonder if they'll know soon it who it is because he's smiling it in the whole. Yeah. He's smiling, but it's not in that like, Barks is really good at drawing like rye

601
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:49,866
recognition.

602
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,336
I think. So I... I'm pretty comfortable

603
00:55:52,793 --> 00:55:54,290
in in the read that

604
00:55:54,827 --> 00:55:55,526
he doesn't

605
00:55:56,023 --> 00:55:56,422
realize.

606
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:06,866
He... I think he's really amused when when the Nephew used capped. Chases the mice out and knocks the stun oil into the stranger. But that's just because Donald kind of appreciates mayhem him.

607
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:15,033
Yeah I guess donald was happy to let them in to get a free sample. And Right. So so Scrooge. I mean, the salesman is...

608
00:56:16,271 --> 00:56:17,545
I mean, It's.

609
00:56:17,882 --> 00:56:20,672
Right. It's the inspector who happens to be a sales.

610
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:21,531
Right.

611
00:56:22,266 --> 00:56:31,043
I you you can you can save yourself a lot more. A lot of trouble by selling the house. I will... When I get my price and then exclusive little.

612
00:56:31,981 --> 00:56:56,511
Right. This Al pages is very silly. It is. It's deep silly. Any other thoughts you guys on this one before going on? Well, the Nephew also say as so Scrooge gets bumped over by the cats and the two thousand threats or house And as he gets bumped over, he gets the the stun all over himself. And the one of the nephews point to them and says, what's the matter of the inspector, he reads to say the least

613
00:56:57,089 --> 00:56:58,366
right. Once again,

614
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:03,671
not really to share whether they know or not. I mean, I think they don't know, but you're not really sure. Well,

615
00:57:04,564 --> 00:57:06,061
because on the next page,

616
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:08,334
Donald is kinda of pondering.

617
00:57:08,831 --> 00:57:12,800
Right? And he says, I'm surprised that Uncle screwed has been

618
00:57:13,337 --> 00:57:20,283
me. So like, he's not registering this even though it's screaming obvious to the reader. That's right. So our next

619
00:57:20,662 --> 00:57:26,983
our next attempt we're gonna see screws next try is that they're gonna hear a loud Scrooge

620
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:29,257
at their door, their Barks.

621
00:57:29,991 --> 00:57:40,054
And when Donald opens the door, he's gonna see a a wicked witch. There's no other word for it. She basically looks like the witch in snow white,

622
00:57:40,912 --> 00:57:41,551
I think.

623
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,609
Right? Yeah. Which would and everything?

624
00:57:44,148 --> 00:57:48,628
Right. Would have been really still culturally just a huge force at this time.

625
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:55,284
She announces herself Al a witch who's moved in next door and says, I don't like you.

626
00:57:55,903 --> 00:57:59,699
And for a lot of the story, Donald just gonna be this really bla Al, like,

627
00:58:00,658 --> 00:58:01,158
really

628
00:58:01,656 --> 00:58:02,136
stoic.

629
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:03,210
Person

630
00:58:03,827 --> 00:58:04,327
saying,

631
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:11,606
I'm sorry to hear that you don't like me what sort of spell when she threatens to cast a spell on him.

632
00:58:11,986 --> 00:58:14,046
And and when when she leaves,

633
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:18,946
you know, he's laughing about it with the Nephews calling her some poor diluted woman.

634
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:28,880
Who thinks she's a witch. What do you guys think? Yeah. I really liked the the the panel with the, like this the second panel it, this the word Scrooge just.

635
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:37,106
Panel. It's it's swedish. Yeah. It's it's a great setup that Donald just refuses to be intimidated.

636
00:58:38,082 --> 00:58:38,162
Yeah.

637
00:58:39,238 --> 00:58:43,128
Yeah. Barks is just trying to draw the away keeps snow wife from memory here.

638
00:58:43,705 --> 00:58:49,930
Yeah. Problem. So looks like, Yeah. Just like she opens for I'm a which that has moved in next door, and I don't like.

639
00:58:50,669 --> 00:58:51,169
I

640
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:55,221
Yeah. The the switch is not good at making friends clearly.

641
00:58:56,241 --> 00:59:10,141
And Scrooge keeps upping the stakes. Do you wanna tell us about the next attempt, Henri Rica? Yeah. So... Alright. So Donald says have you haven't heard of anything so corny, and he hasn't even finished the stent and here Al this crushing and smashing in the kitchen and

642
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,259
Gorilla walks into the living room.

643
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:24,692
And once again, Donald is not faced at all by Gorilla, and he thinks it's an actual gorilla and he said oh, it's just the pet that escaped from a multi lot, which is apparently. Makes this real not in intimidating.

644
00:59:25,868 --> 00:59:32,774
Right. But then one of the Nephew points. So what about this dragon that this coming for the other door? The drag just says, it's

645
00:59:33,393 --> 00:59:42,723
but donald is again not thing they you know things there they must be from some Tv show. So I'll just ask, how's everything snow and show business these days boys?

646
00:59:44,911 --> 00:59:48,207
Then you can see that the gorilla whispering to the dragon...

647
00:59:48,986 --> 00:59:53,861
Which makes it clear that they're actors like, Huey, won't get out. What do we do now? Let's go the office.

648
00:59:54,474 --> 01:00:05,079
For whatever reason, I really like that panel of them just cats these like fantastic creatures just talking to each other casually. It's also the dragon even as actual fire coming.

649
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:08,715
Pretty impressive cost.

650
01:00:09,454 --> 01:00:11,112
They are. Yeah. Those

651
01:00:11,531 --> 01:00:17,352
actually looks pretty scary for... I'll tell you would have cost a lot more probably than

652
01:00:17,689 --> 01:00:18,628
the the difference

653
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,778
in price to it to hire these.

654
01:00:22,609 --> 01:00:23,667
Those are you like

655
01:00:24,044 --> 01:00:32,354
when the when the two creatures, like, confer... Confer with each other and their heads are together, but the next bundle you see that the head of the the dragon is, like,

656
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:34,092
really.

657
01:00:34,472 --> 01:00:36,490
Where the dragon inside is. So

658
01:00:37,588 --> 01:00:40,940
Right. Yeah. Because that next final is is them

659
01:00:41,319 --> 01:00:44,816
on the phone with Scrooge. We see those two actors

660
01:00:45,754 --> 01:00:55,346
and then a woman who is clearly the witch You guys noticed that she's a human woman. Yeah. She's a human and that that's too active are a Barks host human, but she's an actual

661
01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:00,664
She looks like a Huey, Barks. So he totally hired, like, the most famous Hollywood exit.

662
01:01:01,439 --> 01:01:01,678
Sure.

663
01:01:02,475 --> 01:01:07,326
And and so you know, they report to screws that Donald just doesn't scare.

664
01:01:07,806 --> 01:01:23,626
And he just gets off a pit. Consider yourselves fired. I'll try another stun. And and this takes us to good old Willie. You guys were gonna get see Willy his setup up here. I really like the lead up to Scrooge like, pondering.

665
01:01:24,046 --> 01:01:28,706
He's kinda running out of ideas. So he goes back to the book of tie

666
01:01:29,406 --> 01:01:31,586
strategist. I love that title so much.

667
01:01:32,661 --> 01:01:34,781
Any elbows through ghost,

668
01:01:35,141 --> 01:01:36,681
and cheese, wear,

669
01:01:37,301 --> 01:01:38,441
willow the twists,

670
01:01:38,741 --> 01:01:47,976
and he stops there because he says, Willow of the west, there is a form of hideous horror that hasn't been used too often.

671
01:01:48,636 --> 01:01:50,589
And that's kind of like breaking the

672
01:01:50,968 --> 01:01:53,546
right in the fourth wall. Right? Because, like, that's

673
01:01:53,885 --> 01:01:57,921
true. It's literally really what bug Barks was thinking. When he was right discover.

674
01:01:58,774 --> 01:02:03,364
Right. It's it's like a monster that we don't see featured very much.

675
01:02:04,242 --> 01:02:09,271
And and who wants to tell us, what is the will of the west? I don't know, actually. It's it's like there's

676
01:02:09,611 --> 01:02:10,111
swamp

677
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:11,071
thing

678
01:02:11,651 --> 01:02:12,991
made of gas or something.

679
01:02:13,611 --> 01:02:19,829
Well that's that's what it's gonna end up, like, being logically in the story. But, like Yeah. The.

680
01:02:20,646 --> 01:02:23,937
Yeah. It's yeah an actual phenomenon of the... When

681
01:02:24,847 --> 01:02:27,101
guess on marsh and swamps.

682
01:02:27,557 --> 01:02:31,342
Can symptoms sometimes sketch on fire, I think? And so sometimes you'll see, like,

683
01:02:32,276 --> 01:02:38,896
I'm not sure what what's the exact cost by but this gas and sometimes light up and a lot of legends concern

684
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:40,071
or

685
01:02:40,611 --> 01:02:41,231
she just...

686
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:45,291
On this. I know? Right. That's right. I mean,

687
01:02:46,465 --> 01:02:49,182
it's it's what people it's why people joke about, like,

688
01:02:50,102 --> 01:03:01,199
Sighting being swamp gas. Right. Yeah So... And and the the the dutch name for the of the also Al is also what you would call this this guest that you see at as swamp. So

689
01:03:01,936 --> 01:03:03,433
I find it interesting that

690
01:03:04,226 --> 01:03:06,166
Al well see the of the

691
01:03:06,505 --> 01:03:15,221
described as a J lantern. And that's something I didn't know because I I know a Jack and is what you call a Halloween pumpkin if can it. But apparently

692
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:30,491
j lantern is originally a assigned for of the west. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. It's supposed to be like the captured wi Because... And it's... And it's kinda like it's a creature that has been used and pop culture more. You see him in, like, brave

693
01:03:31,591 --> 01:03:32,091
and

694
01:03:32,631 --> 01:03:35,611
twists and like warcraft are kind of the same

695
01:03:35,965 --> 01:03:38,103
Same deal. But then definitely,

696
01:03:38,841 --> 01:03:45,503
oh, yeah. It's definitely something that's not like his common place. And Barks is gonna create his own version

697
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,376
of this here.

698
01:03:48,271 --> 01:03:49,927
So so he hires

699
01:03:50,424 --> 01:03:51,203
a scientist.

700
01:03:51,595 --> 01:03:58,501
He's not gonna use ji for this one. Right? He needs some anonymous scientist is the guy named doctor Super think.

701
01:03:59,299 --> 01:04:04,331
And he orders up. He orders up a willow the list, which the guy

702
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:08,711
explains hopefully for the reader is a jack lantern. And Scrooge

703
01:04:09,071 --> 01:04:09,791
makes these like,

704
01:04:10,684 --> 01:04:24,202
B fingers, which is great and says I want more than the lantern. I want the horrible slit something that carries the lantern. And that's all Barks is gonna give us to go off with basically. That's that's his little

705
01:04:24,579 --> 01:04:27,965
mythology here. But what a commission to get doctor.

706
01:04:30,338 --> 01:04:34,990
Tim, do you wanna tell us about the Inducks and encountering doctor super think in the

707
01:04:35,408 --> 01:04:38,755
swamp later? Yeah. So the docs are apparently

708
01:04:39,093 --> 01:04:40,909
going out fishing in the evening

709
01:04:41,885 --> 01:04:44,315
nearest sw mir March. And

710
01:04:45,134 --> 01:04:46,233
doctor Super think

711
01:04:46,812 --> 01:04:58,142
is on the water with his little boat and he asked the that if it'll help them help catch her... Some of the Barks gas and adults are sure. And and the next page,

712
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,814
they've proceed to to capture some of it

713
01:05:01,446 --> 01:05:10,126
Donald has to stir at the bottom and then the the loose comes up and but that's the way they they capture the gas, and he also sends the Inducks into an old mine.

714
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:14,296
Ask them to bring some mold from its must year's depth.

715
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:15,875
And

716
01:05:17,093 --> 01:05:19,371
the end they they've collected all the things.

717
01:05:20,265 --> 01:05:21,444
And doctor

718
01:05:21,863 --> 01:05:24,799
was he doctor? Yeah. The doctor asked them

719
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:27,810
if they want to help him some more. And

720
01:05:28,707 --> 01:05:30,405
next thing we were in the...

721
01:05:31,142 --> 01:05:33,298
I think it's laboratory and Mh.

722
01:05:34,136 --> 01:05:34,955
Docs asks

723
01:05:35,413 --> 01:05:36,531
ask, what are you gonna make?

724
01:05:37,543 --> 01:05:38,402
A one of the,

725
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:45,916
a clear old chap wants me to make him one complete with gas growth arms on lu eyes. I like that reference to huge.

726
01:05:48,524 --> 01:05:48,883
Yeah. Yeah.

727
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,300
So.

728
01:05:51,715 --> 01:05:51,795
Yeah.

729
01:05:53,685 --> 01:05:58,257
So in the in the final panel, the gas fuse into burst white sparks

730
01:05:58,595 --> 01:05:59,095
and

731
01:05:59,673 --> 01:06:11,184
doc asks the donald... That's the lights and watch when it's the guest strikes the mold. So so, yeah, we're we're into the process of creating the the of the on this page. Right.

732
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:12,602
I

733
01:06:13,155 --> 01:06:15,967
I love this, like, pseudo scientific

734
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:16,805
nonsense.

735
01:06:18,577 --> 01:06:23,601
That bar is pretty pretty elaborate creating for this this very silly

736
01:06:24,501 --> 01:06:32,687
process, but but it feels kinda believable. But at at the same time, it's quite funny. Yeah. I think we're within these economics as long as you sound...

737
01:06:33,025 --> 01:06:36,597
If as long as the character stops convinced or convincing, you can basically

738
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:53,956
right whatever logic he wants as long as it's convincing within the economic. And right. Something I I found very funny with these pages that's is not there and the that's translation is that this this doctor just keeps asking them to help with increasingly weird things and to absolutely everything he says, Donald just says, share.

739
01:06:55,926 --> 01:06:59,658
Help me with this Smart guest. Sure. Don't you go into the mind with me. Sure.

740
01:07:00,834 --> 01:07:07,288
Did just... I mean, I would also be intrigued. So it's understandable that they that they going along.

741
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:14,091
Right. And and is like, just just profoundly ridiculous too. Yeah. And this is in between

742
01:07:14,751 --> 01:07:15,711
in the dutch version,

743
01:07:16,151 --> 01:07:27,251
the panel the the gas bubbles up. It's unintentionally hilarious. Oh, yeah. This this him... They missed the same coffee so he was also laughing. Oh, yeah. Because the the the gas rice is up

744
01:07:27,869 --> 01:07:35,623
But the gas clouds should be white, but in the touch version, they did something wrong, and instead of them being white, it says the word white

745
01:07:36,336 --> 01:07:42,196
Oh, So like the... They just have to work wise written in them so they... Terms like Al bites and it

746
01:07:42,496 --> 01:07:47,928
No. They just intended to call and white they forgot there's something does... So it just says white

747
01:07:48,387 --> 01:07:53,621
instead us... Yeah. Being the actual caller right. We'll send you a Screen transcription here. Nice. Yeah.

748
01:07:54,995 --> 01:07:58,092
You guys the this whole sequence is also it's very

749
01:07:58,512 --> 01:07:59,012
atmospheric.

750
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:01,049
It's very moody.

751
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:03,847
It's not like actually creepy

752
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:10,054
I mean, up until we get the the kind of the the creature taking shape

753
01:08:10,512 --> 01:08:12,386
on on that net page.

754
01:08:12,805 --> 01:08:19,978
But the docks never look scared. So we're not we're not scared. But like we see... We we hear the doctor

755
01:08:20,477 --> 01:08:52,291
talk about a wi shape forming and asking for help if it breaks... Yeah. If they need to control it if it breaks out, and the Inducks get to see it, and Donald describes Al a bunch of Marsh gas and mold scores, but it looks like it's alive. So I feel like we never really like... Even though they say it is alive, I don't think it's ever really clear if he's what he's created here. But but who cares. It looks cool. It looks cool. It it has great character design. Is this what what you guys found memorable

756
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:56,527
about the story? You know, like like I did these these panels

757
01:08:56,961 --> 01:09:16,491
we only get a handful of them of of Willie himself here. Yeah. Absolutely absolutely. I mean, it's also one of those this sparks characters that only appears but you just really remember the character design and it's actually... It's a ten but to eat one of the do last year, he actually gave really a cameo in it... Oh how cool.

758
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:20,583
I can I can say that it's memorable to him at least? Yeah.

759
01:09:20,962 --> 01:09:26,265
Yeah. Sure was. Well, please do share that. I'd love to see that.

760
01:09:26,604 --> 01:09:28,142
What what do you find so memorable

761
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,711
about him, Tim? Well, it's it's also the build

762
01:09:32,731 --> 01:09:34,911
until the finally centimeters

763
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,406
these these... Especially in the dutch

764
01:09:38,622 --> 01:09:40,839
application, the the coloring is also very hyper.

765
01:09:41,296 --> 01:09:41,796
And

766
01:09:42,493 --> 01:09:45,201
this real mysterious thing that's growing and

767
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:50,156
just... What essentially comes out of it it's just this really other world we

768
01:09:50,575 --> 01:09:51,315
thing and

769
01:09:52,293 --> 01:09:54,011
educated and really made an pressing on me.

770
01:09:54,985 --> 01:09:58,673
And during the time when when I was reading the these comments,

771
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:00,387
I also was reading

772
01:10:00,804 --> 01:10:05,721
from who comments or another common. Mh. There also so all these days.

773
01:10:07,754 --> 01:10:10,526
And there was kind of the same theme with these these

774
01:10:10,863 --> 01:10:19,140
one of the guys and then yeah spear was just the same. So those two stories were in my life at the same time. So kind of

775
01:10:20,118 --> 01:10:20,618
fantastic

776
01:10:21,435 --> 01:10:21,935
yeah.

777
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:35,875
Yeah. Because if if I don't know exactly what Aj was when when I read this, but probably five or six, and I probably couldn't even really read that shit, but that must have been one of the serious things I had seen up until that point right now.

778
01:10:36,968 --> 01:10:44,661
Strangest... It stands out. It's it's so visually cool. He's got these ten arms and these eyes on stocks.

779
01:10:45,155 --> 01:10:46,790
I love it. I love the care.

780
01:10:47,229 --> 01:10:50,043
You can hear the experiment music playing in the background.

781
01:10:51,537 --> 01:10:51,856
Right.

782
01:10:52,629 --> 01:10:56,000
Right And then love is that that he's serious he's,

783
01:10:56,816 --> 01:11:02,315
but he's very cute. He looks to the silly, but also cute. And the left... Like, the the docks clearly

784
01:11:02,774 --> 01:11:12,555
like him right away. And the moment... They see him, they're all smiling at him, and the doctor says they can feed him. So like, like he's said a little cute course c or something.

785
01:11:12,973 --> 01:11:20,909
Right. And and that that's really the last kind of memorable bit of the story is that we get this cool build up to

786
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:27,588
to Scrooge doing what he's gonna do, which is like Launch him Donald to scared of them.

787
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:30,140
It's... Fucking nephew also.

788
01:11:30,837 --> 01:11:31,337
Right.

789
01:11:32,751 --> 01:11:35,405
Yeah. It's a great we get some great villainous

790
01:11:35,902 --> 01:11:40,975
expressions here from sp, and and maybe the best panel of Lily

791
01:11:41,395 --> 01:11:41,895
is

792
01:11:42,195 --> 01:11:45,895
as he is kinda creeping up to Donald House

793
01:11:46,249 --> 01:11:47,868
in, like, a full with

794
01:11:48,247 --> 01:11:49,765
full page with panel.

795
01:11:50,244 --> 01:11:52,781
I I love this page you guys watching

796
01:11:54,094 --> 01:11:55,093
watching Scrooge

797
01:11:55,573 --> 01:12:03,185
sm and scheming as he absorbs Willie going to scare them and seeing the Ducktales just excited greet him

798
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:04,478
high, willie

799
01:12:04,975 --> 01:12:05,475
and

800
01:12:06,171 --> 01:12:10,460
talking about getting him some tool roots as though they've got them lying around.

801
01:12:11,395 --> 01:12:16,981
Oh, and and Willie delight full little smacking of his lips or looking his chops.

802
01:12:17,639 --> 01:12:18,299
Is it...

803
01:12:18,798 --> 01:12:20,936
It's it's really adorable.

804
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:22,250
And I love our Scrooge

805
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:25,810
described as this horrific monster. Like nobody could stand.

806
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:32,845
They see him. I can hear them yelling inside of he's so excited to for him to be verified

807
01:12:33,185 --> 01:12:41,211
and he thinks apparently that the are fine. Right. It's Yeah. And I I I don't know maybe it's just me, but I think maybe looks the adorable.

808
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:58,214
Yeah. Oh, yeah. What what do you think in? Yeah. Barks this way with with regular animals to make them look really acute something in the eyes I think I also to say tim that this looks that that panel was really looking to cute. It really reminds me if your drawing style, so you're really must've have internally.

809
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:05,045
Probably did. Yeah. Do think. That's so cool. Yeah I also really like the face

810
01:13:05,861 --> 01:13:09,948
the Willie makes when he's still in the the bucket thing. Yeah. Yeah. Alright

811
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:20,785
it looks like he's scared by his own Ja and and that his holding. Yeah. That they called two monster meet where they had, like, a female looking version of Willy

812
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:21,985
meeting

813
01:13:22,405 --> 01:13:23,345
warm meeting

814
01:13:24,725 --> 01:13:32,715
sm, the bad, the og from Yeah. Trick treat. But other than that, I didn't actually run across Yeah. I mean I wonder.

815
01:13:33,294 --> 01:13:36,970
I wonder if that's because I I used them as in as an ice sculpture.

816
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:39,399
So it's not

817
01:13:40,334 --> 01:14:02,798
yours is listed as a cameo. I think, but Okay. With a lot of these cameo, it's... I mean, somebody has to write to them index? Right. It's not always Inducks fully. I don't remember for sure, but I'm pretty sure that He has said cameo and some touch comic like there a one by I added, and has a lot of monster to seen it. And I'm sure there there's some Barks monster Daniel...

818
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:16,327
I wouldn't be surprised if he was in there, and I wouldn't be surprised if My high used them on on one of his posters maybe, but I would have to sure. They dig through my old call to... Those type of things are not always listed online. So...

819
01:14:17,166 --> 01:14:20,079
Great. This this I I love the sequence.

820
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:24,599
I will say that nothing else in the rest of the story

821
01:14:25,099 --> 01:14:28,972
really quite, like, stands up. To how cool

822
01:14:29,668 --> 01:14:44,370
this part is. Right? Yeah. It's... People remember it for the sequence, not not the story itself. Although, there's a lot to be said for the rest. Of that. Yeah. I mean, that counts for a lot of stories I would say. Yeah. Right. But I mean the only one page left, I think so.

823
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:49,604
Right. Right. I I will know before going on that I really like what they did

824
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:53,284
on... At least the reprint that I was going off of the coloring

825
01:14:53,624 --> 01:14:55,457
on these few pages

826
01:14:56,073 --> 01:15:03,170
and the kinda glow that he cast, I think, is just really nice. This is one where it the character needs to be colored.

827
01:15:03,943 --> 01:15:09,308
Very like thoughtfully. Stands out Because, of course, really is supposed to be a glow and a dark translucent

828
01:15:10,044 --> 01:15:27,236
we feature holding on lights or. So that will be great. Al to to yeah. You can only... He could only get it give it and hope that we would color a way that would work with this, but Yeah. That's a great thing to point out about how the king is so suggestive of the the the evening.

829
01:15:28,075 --> 01:15:38,797
So So, Tim, what do you think about the closing of the story? I I feel I feel like it's a little weak. Yeah. It it kind of is, but it to be, it's it's also so ridiculous

830
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:42,423
setup that that it it pays it off

831
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:43,596
well decently.

832
01:15:44,449 --> 01:15:44,949
So

833
01:15:45,529 --> 01:15:47,229
so Uncle Scrooge, apparently,

834
01:15:47,769 --> 01:15:48,609
several weeks later,

835
01:15:49,169 --> 01:15:50,229
has bill a factory

836
01:15:50,849 --> 01:15:52,489
clear around Donald house.

837
01:15:53,024 --> 01:15:53,524
And

838
01:15:53,862 --> 01:16:02,026
Donald is still holding out for his price. That diet work and make me sell. And then all of a sudden, there's this blazing of trumpets

839
01:16:02,459 --> 01:16:03,199
str bones.

840
01:16:03,699 --> 01:16:04,199
And

841
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:12,175
Donald looks out of his window and the apparently Al it checked, what what but was what they were building near house

842
01:16:13,274 --> 01:16:15,274
john bone, so that's what he's making perspective.

843
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:24,989
Things out of the window and says, yes, and we'll be testing thousands of them in this courtyard. Now are you going to sell at my price and then

844
01:16:26,539 --> 01:16:31,183
Donald says, okay. You win I'll sell price. And the net ask,

845
01:16:31,559 --> 01:16:34,090
donald how much what's your price on.

846
01:16:34,969 --> 01:16:37,530
That that's thousand them... The same as Scrooge

847
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:43,923
except that I wanted twenty five cents more to pay for my for sales sign. And then we see the

848
01:16:44,382 --> 01:16:45,002
the nephews

849
01:16:46,379 --> 01:16:50,395
saying, tens of millions of Inducks in the world and we get those two for relatives.

850
01:16:51,864 --> 01:16:55,850
The funny thing is you see donald and Scrooge arguing in the background again,

851
01:16:56,368 --> 01:17:01,429
so it's it's it's this hopeless situation. Right enough just look all this there.

852
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:06,818
Just like sing sink against each other one is holding the artist filter.

853
01:17:07,436 --> 01:17:09,389
But I I I personally

854
01:17:09,769 --> 01:17:19,922
like how the story is because it's it's almost like such... The build up is so big the faith pays off. It's almost such a let down that it's funny. Because so petty. And

855
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:23,757
that's right. So the the toronto factory is just

856
01:17:24,295 --> 01:17:24,769
ridiculous

857
01:17:25,747 --> 01:17:35,101
It's literally really a a giant factory haul and all the trumpets are pointing out out of the window exactly at donald house of course of course. Purchased betty. Huey,.

858
01:17:35,979 --> 01:17:45,869
The way he sticks his head out of the wind... This is so fancy and I I I love that all of this stuff was to the whole belt exclusion being pet and the and the build was

859
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:52,624
overkill from his part but the whole at the whole argument from Mcdonald's part also very petty and stupid. So

860
01:17:53,080 --> 01:18:00,408
to be, it's actually very funny ending because it's... Because the build is so big and it leads to basically twenty five cents that makes it buddy?

861
01:18:00,787 --> 01:18:05,962
Right. Exactly. All all of the humor of the ending is in how

862
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:07,360
just

863
01:18:07,714 --> 01:18:09,692
How much overkill there was

864
01:18:10,151 --> 01:18:11,250
for this ridiculously

865
01:18:11,869 --> 01:18:27,281
patty ending. And and it's like it's a super old joke. Right? I've seen... I've seen this exact bit at least the building a factory all the way around someone when they're not willing to sell, and then them regretting it be because, you know, it's gonna be something

866
01:18:27,699 --> 01:18:33,767
that that would drive them away. But like, the humor in it is is really elevated, I think by Barks

867
01:18:34,486 --> 01:18:34,965
expressions.

868
01:18:35,418 --> 01:18:56,823
And there's a... I do think it was still in the time and Barks was Al the studio working on the dot com. There's a call cartoon so animated short called t trouble, which has a similar theme being completely overkill. I seen you in a few years, but in that one, Donald neighbor is playing a t bone, and it's so annoying that it noise the gods

869
01:18:57,319 --> 01:19:00,024
and can give donald powers just so he can

870
01:19:01,161 --> 01:19:02,000
Remember that one.

871
01:19:02,718 --> 01:19:17,239
Probably I'm probably telling the story Al wrong, but I feel it's somehow feels sparks in way too. It's so over the top. And it's like so involves strong bones. And it it literally... It's it anger the gods and becomes Al funny to get rid of the terminal.

872
01:19:18,172 --> 01:19:27,939
I would have to to look this car tune up again. And I'm probably telling the story completely wrong but I'm I'm curious if this is a common cartoon that Barks worked on because these

873
01:19:28,356 --> 01:19:46,256
reused themes from some of the old sorts and economics too? Right. So... Or even even just individual gag that he really liked. Either eight's cartoon watching. So... Yeah. That's cool. I'll I'll check it out as I add it. Yeah. So, you know, what what what additional or closing thoughts do you guys have about

874
01:19:46,954 --> 01:19:48,133
Willie here

875
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:53,124
slash, are there any panels that you really wanna highlight or mention?

876
01:19:54,324 --> 01:20:00,239
Outside it that to me it's it's not per s, one of the best from expiry. But to me, this is very

877
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:20,508
quintessential Scrooge donald comic and I think a lot of them a lot of the Dutch stomach still were inspired by these type of stories. So to me this really feels like the Scrooge I grew up with and it... Yeah. Just like classic. You like that means spirited. Scrooge. I mean, when it's funny, I don't I... It depends on how it's used, of course. But

878
01:20:20,966 --> 01:20:26,511
so over the top that it's... Yeah it's just... Yeah. I don't know the relations between this family very unhealthy.

879
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:28,270
Yeah. Because

880
01:20:29,128 --> 01:20:31,186
a wide ben see screws wondering

881
01:20:32,085 --> 01:20:32,585
thinking

882
01:20:33,139 --> 01:20:40,239
fires and slots are against the laws if that's the only thing that keeps right. I see when I was reading... It's true

883
01:20:40,593 --> 01:20:42,569
reading the comment I sent Al penalty to

884
01:20:42,906 --> 01:20:44,143
thought it was about. Yeah

885
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:50,146
Glad you mentioned that. He's implying that he would use it if he if he could find

886
01:20:50,817 --> 01:20:55,898
It's a far. You would just sets the howard how this that fields on fire, I guess. But...

887
01:20:56,394 --> 01:21:07,914
Yeah, in terms of benefits they're there's a lot of very great expressions. The last then was very funny. And that, of course, this the second to last page when of course, really climbing our great, but also, it's one of the most

888
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:10,068
taking so much delight into

889
01:21:10,445 --> 01:21:11,224
doing this.

890
01:21:12,638 --> 01:21:14,033
Right. Very very.

891
01:21:14,432 --> 01:21:21,978
Yeah. That that quote that you mentioned the the little sequence where he's pondering what to do. Those four panels

892
01:21:22,557 --> 01:21:23,896
are really awesome.

893
01:21:24,729 --> 01:21:25,628
Him pacing

894
01:21:26,046 --> 01:21:43,970
going into the book and then the silhouette him continuing to look in the book. It's all like, very... I don't know. Barb keeps it very interest even though it's just a sequence of him thinking about it. Yeah. He's just sitting and thinking, but he's facing around and sitting down They always has these ways to just make the characters

895
01:21:44,349 --> 01:21:52,540
do something interesting while there's something for... Would not really be boring Inducks ground. Right. And the same with the donald and the net pennsylvania. Just look at when in the house.

896
01:21:53,155 --> 01:21:59,555
Sometimes this sitting on the floor, then Donald is playing in the chair and they keep changing process. He just keeps his visually interesting.

897
01:22:00,169 --> 01:22:15,305
Right. I mean, the whole sequence were we're really is being created, but when they go to the to the lab, and there's a the huge mysterious looking tank and the the the Ducktales just look on with their hats and their hands. The duck will look very cute in stomach for.

898
01:22:16,205 --> 01:22:20,946
Say. They just observing all this stuff going on. And I like their very warm interactions

899
01:22:21,362 --> 01:22:25,664
with the doctor super think. Is it? Yeah. It's just very

900
01:22:26,321 --> 01:22:28,896
contrast with screws quite a bit. Yeah. And I wonder

901
01:22:29,793 --> 01:22:47,548
if parts didn't use ji here because it would be too obvious if he would just... I mean, he would Scrooge sc obviously. So Al spelled He's doing it for screws. Right. Yeah. So super is funny name. Yeah. And and I don't know if Ji would infants... Well, I just stayed in this previous story, but... Yeah.

902
01:22:48,827 --> 01:22:50,860
We didn't invent something like a bit

903
01:22:52,198 --> 01:22:52,898
or something.

904
01:22:53,357 --> 01:22:59,191
Right. Yeah. The doctor doesn't ask questions. He just... Huey, still... He he just took the money.

905
01:23:00,762 --> 01:23:09,450
What's gonna happen with before really, though? I don't like how screw is freaking this I know. It's too bad that Willie just kind of... It would have been nice if

906
01:23:10,348 --> 01:23:19,046
maybe we saw the kids fondly playing with with Willie at the end. It probably lives on grandpa's firm now as a scare or something. That's just... Has

907
01:23:19,586 --> 01:23:20,086
Okay.

908
01:23:20,426 --> 01:23:24,166
Yeah. There you go. Yeah... Well, thank you guys so much

909
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:25,046

912
01:23:39,253 --> 01:24:05,236
Before we close it out, though, do you guys wanna, like, point anyone to any any art pages of yours or or mention anything that you have going on or coming out soon? So in in any case, I think with when you post... May you make it post, maybe you could we could include like a little screenshot of very intense comment. When you when you look... I looked when you look and Inducks the character, you do get page as well. Could

913
01:24:05,812 --> 01:24:11,133
I will definitely be sure to do that. Yeah. And then I can link your your pages

914
01:24:11,605 --> 01:24:13,785
you guys but you guys don't need my

915
01:24:14,205 --> 01:24:21,951
my traffic. You guys have some some well traffic ones, but it's nice to share. Share with people what you guys do. But yeah. I would honestly.

916
01:24:22,487 --> 01:24:34,106
It's also... I I recently traded original pages with them, and I got this it's great hilarious page, but they are just reminds me of this stomach in general it's so it's in in our Dna.

917
01:24:35,245 --> 01:24:35,325
Yeah.

918
01:24:36,459 --> 01:24:51,456
This silly to send that also all the the shading. So I would definitely show show that one off as well. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. Press me on I post art on both my personal twitter and my Instagram, but I would have to spell my name, I think.

919
01:24:52,989 --> 01:25:09,316
Probably. So it's it's it's Henri enrique draws on Twitter and henri enrique could g on for the first of the the letter of my last name on on Instagram. I think and x I occasionally post work and progress of economics and things too there. So it's it's irrelevant.

920
01:25:10,116 --> 01:25:11,750
For. Yeah. For me,

921
01:25:12,329 --> 01:25:17,864
