1
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,495
We can have

2
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:37,825
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer an artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comments of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological

3
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:56,891
publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever a grown who enjoys dot com. I've got a returning guest host with me.

4
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,701
Awesome in. Do you wanna introduce yourself and

5
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,390
could you also tell us if you you like, so many kids had a greek pathology phase? Sure.

6
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:18,082
Austin, Kelly. Yeah. I've been on here a couple of times. It's always a pleasure because, of course, there's nothing better in the world than talking about a good Donald doctor or Uncle Scrooge, Comic Barks story. Greek mythology, I was never

7
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:30,829
big into it, but I remember a kid thinking like, wow. This is... Like, some of it gets really scary. You know? I remember the one story about the guy who has to push the rock up the hill for, like, all eternity. You know what I'm talking about? Oh, yeah. Sis.

8
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:32,662
Mh. Yeah. Says.

9
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:44,068
So I was vaguely familiar with all of it, but it wasn't until I gotten into the Carl Barks comics and I really started to, like, properly educate myself on that sort of stuff, you know or, you know? Yeah. Mean, Barks.

10
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:56,412
Not that's one of the great things that a lot of people like about Barks is that he really touches a lot on myths from a lot of different cultures. Al lot of those greek mists have really perm pop culture. I myself

11
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:06,336
definitely had my, like, greek mythology phase where I was totally fascinated with it probably around fifth grader. So my my school, you know, we we had a big unit on it.

12
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:10,943
I'm talking, of course, about Greek mythology because

13
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,067
today's story that we get to discuss is the Ta

14
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:16,025
Bonkers

15
00:02:16,482 --> 00:02:19,256
very weird Uncle Scrooge adventure

16
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:20,508
the golden

17
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:22,143
fleece. Yeah. And

18
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:34,828
I I don't know, Austin I'm pretty... I'm pretty excited about this when I feel like this one looms large in Carl Barks pant of stories. Yeah. I I agree that it is very weird.

19
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:39,857
I hadn't read it in a long time, but my I was reading it for this recording,

20
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:42,292
you know, that first half is very

21
00:02:42,750 --> 00:03:10,103
big on thrilled and its action and I was really into it. But the whole thing came up halfway about the taste testing, and I was like, this is getting super bizarre. You know, which is good because that's, you know, what call Barks does, but it just got very weird, but it is a good kind of weird. And this is also... I think the second Barks story I ever read after the nice. Ground. So it is sort of an nostalgic one as well. Yeah. This is like a nostalgic favorite of mine.

22
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:24,793
It it was... I read it in Gladstone album series. And I just... I tended to read those over and over because, like, I I I didn't put those in boxes, you know, They're too big for boxes. So they were out on the shelf, and they were presented so nicely.

23
00:03:25,846 --> 00:03:38,332
So so I really read this one quite a bit. And and like I said, I was I was into this story. I was this is one of the times that I actually knew about kind of the the myth and the background of it before

24
00:03:38,871 --> 00:04:01,229
reading the Barks story. Usually, I... It was the other way around. But have you ever seen the the Ray harry house the old stop motion Jason in the Argo? That's pretty famous? I actually haven't. Sounds very interesting. Yes. It's a great one. It's one of the most famous of those like old stop motion monster movies. It has a pretty famous scene with these skeletons

25
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:03,225
rising from the ground,

26
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:10,790
and and he... If if you are a stop motion, but which I I am of a fan of stop motion animation

27
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,350
Jason the is like one of the all time great. Harry Has

28
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,870
animated a hydro

29
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:19,439
with all of its heads interacting.

30
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:21,808
It's it's really incredible.

31
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:23,004
Sounds yes.

32
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:25,178
So so, yeah, I'd I'd

33
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:33,323
I was familiar with the story. Of course, they take liberties with it in the movie. And and Barks is gonna take a lot of liberty.

34
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:44,867
With the story of the Golden fleece. Do you think Austin, do you do you have enough of an idea of the contours of the old myth to like? Sum it up or would you rather I do it?

35
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:58,615
Probably best you do it. I have kind of a basic understanding, but Yeah. Not I I say I've got a a pretty room rudimentary understanding of it myself. But, like, basically, the golden fleece is this mythical.

36
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:12,790
Hide of a golden Ram, a magical ram, and it's what... It's what Jason and his argo were going off on a on a quest to what was, like, described Al the ends of the earth in their in their famous ship, the argo.

37
00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:16,818
And then there's a lot of extra details about

38
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,110
mid... He he needs a woman named Adi india

39
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,389
Mid who helps him

40
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,530
obtain the fleas through some sub Huey,

41
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:28,200
It is it's a pretty gruesome

42
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:39,035
story. As you mentioned, a lot of the old greek myths are are pretty pretty chilly. There's some nightmare item. Yeah. I was looking into the, you know, the original story with the argo and everything.

43
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:59,811
And I was surprised because it is very peculiar. And, of course, As we said, Barks takes a ton of those liberty sort of to make it kid friendly because after all uncle Scrooge was for, like, a younger audience, but it is still very interesting to see the direction he takes it in and course, the first half, a lot of it is directly based on that original myth and it kinda gets

44
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:02,525
progressively weirder, which is very cool. Right.

45
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:04,624
Yeah. The this one

46
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:09,237
I think this one stands out for its odd. In a lot of ways.

47
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:12,547
Let's see. Let's I'm gonna cover some of the kind of background

48
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:17,904
around the original printing of it. So the golden fleece thing was originally published

49
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:23,872
I had a covered date of December of fifty five, but I think it was actually early fifty six.

50
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:28,259
So so we're into, like, the second half of the fifties

51
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:30,094
at this point, Austin.

52
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,768
And it feels

53
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:40,304
to me like, kind of a transitional story. Do you do you know, like, Barks of the sixties I feel like he got a little bit deaf here in general,

54
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:53,762
a little bit more screw with some of the stories. So this this kind of almost feels like the start of that to me? Yeah. And in a sense it's like almost like he ran the well drive, like, really nice original

55
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:55,894
sort of more straightforward

56
00:06:56,234 --> 00:07:05,320
mystery adventures, like the four color Mcdonald's, like Old castle Secret and goes to the G. But like, later on, he sorta of uses the silliness...

57
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:18,760
I don't wanna say crutch because that has a negative connotation. But, like, just to give the stories an interesting kick, Right? And it's sort of starts with golden fleece and, you know, land beneath the ground, and that kinda spirals into

58
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:24,163
later on stuff like the the postman man's story, which everyone hates from the gold.

59
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:29,951
Right. Yeah. He's definitely gonna get into some like pretty kinda concepts.

60
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:36,703
In in this upcoming run of stories nowadays that he's out of kinda of the first ten issues

61
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,548
of uncle Scrooge, because because we're in

62
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:43,819
number twelve is our issue number here. And

63
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:50,304
I... Oh, so I guess general correct here. I had mentioned in a previous

64
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:52,244
episode that the Secret of Al

65
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:53,664
was

66
00:07:54,284 --> 00:08:00,628
Barks last thirty two pager it is actually this one. I was let us by the fact that

67
00:08:01,444 --> 00:08:05,932
if you look it up, Wikipedia tells you that this one was thirty one pages

68
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:10,654
that's because, like, they cut out a panel in the original

69
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:23,639
because they wanted to squeeze in the dell pledge to parents or the Dell promise to parents, I guess, which is like their old, you know, don't come after us Comic book Authority

70
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:33,927
attempt to remain family friendly. Sure. Because they, of course, they didn't have like that. Common book authority seal of approval on the cover that everyone else had at the time. Right.

71
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:39,270
And and this one's got twelve reprint, which is a pretty good number of them.

72
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:43,620
Did you happen to come across some of the

73
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:52,296
information Austin about Barks being asked to Gladstone this one down a little bit. Yeah. I found a little interesting

74
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:54,489
fact about some panels

75
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:57,041
halfway through the story when

76
00:08:57,354 --> 00:09:17,962
Donald and screws get captured by the la. Him having to red draw some of the panels because they originally suggested what the editors called in Insanity. Right. Sound like, really interesting. And, of course, like, I'm sure you know about changing the name of the herpes to the large. Yes. Exactly. Why are we calling them? The Barks

77
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,020
Austin

78
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,017
instead of

79
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:31,289
instead of as in the Greek miss. The the herpes piece are the the bird like women creatures that that men... So they jimenez a man named Fin

80
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:32,449
in the original

81
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:33,329
myth.

82
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,596
They're like his punishment. But why are we calling them lowercase keys instead?

83
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:44,009
As far as I could tell, I think what Barks said was Harp had, like, a really bad

84
00:09:44,468 --> 00:10:06,941
connotation. And what Barks called a street walker, which I'm pretty sure of prostitute. Right? So... Yes. You know. Yeah, Barks actual quote is pretty good because it sounds very like Barks. He said, I almost had to eat those thirty two pages of drawings. It seems that Harp is an disputed nic nickname for a street walker, I managed to reset... To save the story by ren.

85
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:15,497
Them lowercase keys instead. And and you know, the name is is is pretty important and and it's important that he was able to come up with something

86
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:19,489
for the little gimmick that he's gonna use later on.

87
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:33,319
Yeah. So, like, we could we could spend a lot of time kinda of recount the old miss and and what he based it on. But but it's pretty famous, and I think I think most people will have at least like a passing

88
00:10:34,014 --> 00:10:35,551
familiarity with it. So

89
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:40,652
why don't I mention a few of the international titles

90
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:50,699
and and then we can launch into the story. It's itself. Sounds good. Yeah. So I guess the thing with a story like this. Is that

91
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:59,059
it's it's based on this myth that is super super famous. So in general, people translating it for publication

92
00:10:59,374 --> 00:11:00,433
in other countries,

93
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:18,054
they all came up with the same title. It's it's all called, you know, and the golden fleece. Or in search of the golden and fleece, which means, of course that they'd kinda miss out on the neat little pun in English that you get from the story the Golden flee

94
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:24,085
because, of course, to to fleece someone is to, like, trick them or to

95
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:33,999
to rip someone off. So it's a really... It's a great Barks title. But it's pretty dine when you translate it. So I pulled out

96
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,713
Brazilian Portuguese.

97
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,547
It is Uv

98
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:38,464
Del,

99
00:11:38,841 --> 00:11:40,395
which is gluten fleece.

100
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,470
And then Finland,

101
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,882
I've I've been avoiding Finland for a while, so I thought I'd cycled back around to It is

102
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:49,760
Cool.

103
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:51,794
Which...

104
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:58,269
So this was interesting. When I plugged it in, Austin to Google translate, it gave me the golden holly.

105
00:11:58,648 --> 00:12:03,797
But I'm I'm gonna guess. That's just Google translate having a hard time with finish.

106
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:10,739
Yeah. Sounds like that. I'm sure it's the golden fleece. And then I will finish with France

107
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:13,893
where it is love Al the

108
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:17,385
door and that is in search of the gold fleece.

109
00:12:18,158 --> 00:12:24,980
Alright. So let's see. Any anything else you wanna cover you wanted dimension before we launch into the story Austin?

110
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:40,815
Probably not. I kinda like that all the the titles are just kind of the same general thing. But I do feel like I should probably just point out that today, I'm using my copy of screws number twelve, which is nice. To go Is Corey. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm that's in the error when

111
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:43,852
Barks had all of these neat

112
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:48,207
adventure stories, these iconic adventure stories with these, like, really

113
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:51,579
anonymous gag titles or tag covers.

114
00:12:52,517 --> 00:13:22,105
Yeah. It's very weird because he could have done a lot of more interesting stuff with the covers than just know. Scrooge having a time glass filled with gold coins, but, you know... Right. And I I... I've I've never, like, really read any reason why I think this was Al last dictate tape. But my my assumption is that they liked the idea of having these covers that could kinda match for any story that they could reviews as they want it Sure. Yeah. Alright. So let's see. We're we're still pretty early into the Scrooge series.

115
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:27,316
And And I guess it's it's interesting to me Austin that he...

116
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:37,832
In the first, like, run of uncle Scrooge stories, you know, he seems to have really been thinking about how he can use his new character, you know, Str likes to go on treasure hunts.

117
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:39,867
Sp is worried about his money.

118
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:44,659
We had some of the kind of reflective stories that kind of built up Scrooge

119
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:50,069
methodology. And and by this point, you know, we're back in Treasure hunt mode,

120
00:13:51,027 --> 00:13:54,760
But it's interesting that this story is not, like...

121
00:13:55,218 --> 00:14:03,922
We're into the miss and there's usually an explanation for these mythical things. But but we're really gonna land into these

122
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:04,761
mythological

123
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:12,774
creatures that are literally straight out of the mess. So I do find that interesting. And as we open, it is a classic

124
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:20,984
shot of Scrooge in his bin. We got a a half page splash panel and and he is pondering.

125
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:29,475
I imagine here, Bark is like, okay, what's what's something that rich, man might worry about. Maybe he's gonna worry about his his clothes.

126
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:35,931
Because that's what Scrooge is thinking about. He's thinking how it's odd that he's never really

127
00:14:37,026 --> 00:15:05,479
had the kind of clothes that suit, a man at his station. We got a reference it's neat here to having bought his old broad cloth At a rum sale and Scotland in nineteen o two. That of course is gonna be one of those details that Don Rosa is gonna pluck out for his life and times of Scrooge series. And he kind resolves that he would like to get a special coat made to loaf around and, like, other rich man.

128
00:15:05,857 --> 00:15:14,655
And he decides that he can have it fancier than average because he'll have it made of pure gold and he holds up a bar from a stack.

129
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:23,020
And I like that he mentions, it'll be cheap because he's already got the goal. Of course. Alright. What do you think austin and this feels a little bit un Scrooge

130
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:26,352
to kind of be worried about, you know, his appearance?

131
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:27,484
But...

132
00:15:27,823 --> 00:15:33,757
But but I like the angle here. Yeah. I I do agree that it seems like the clothing

133
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:35,490
concern was sort of just

134
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:51,760
me and out of nowhere for this particular story. Like, I find it funny at the beginning, like, the opening line is like, nothing is topped quest for the golden coat, you know, which is like Right. Well, if it was his big question and when we heard about it and you know, earlier on.

135
00:15:52,420 --> 00:16:02,408
I find it funny. He just picks up like, the bar of gold and says, yeah. I can make this into a coke. Right. If any idea how that's gonna work out. I I like to how Barks kind of

136
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:03,565
spotlight

137
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:14,794
for the reader, how strange this is gonna be. He says right off the right off the bat in the little narrator box what a strange adventure Change adventures. Know. So

138
00:16:15,212 --> 00:16:18,299
next, we find Scrooge over at Ducktales,

139
00:16:19,296 --> 00:16:20,753
trying to get his solid

140
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:22,070
gold coat

141
00:16:23,165 --> 00:17:14,369
and I'll it wouldn't work out because it's Ducktales tells him the code gonna be cri like tin foil, which, of course Scrooge doesn't thought about. You know, we Severino these stories that Scrooge is sort of urine from money kind of overcomes him when it comes to, like, logical rational thinking, which I always find interesting. Of course Ducktales taylor name drops the golden fleece, which gets him interested. And we see kind of a shady character sitting in the background in, like, the silhouette, which is very interesting colored in purple. Scrooge just walking away Sad when he sees a big shadow following him. We get a nice chase sequence with a couple interesting poses And here's where our Scrooge rounds the corner Al he's running away, and he finds Donald just hang on on the corner. Which is nice because this little small town dynamic this mindset that Barks has that just walking around, you can run into someone you know. I find interesting, of course. Just kinda tips is little

142
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:21,761
hand and, of course, Barks in grow in a big city where something like that would never happen. Right. Yeah. It's interesting how he

143
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,214
introduces this quote sinister,

144
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:25,694
you know, foreign...

145
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:29,815
Yeah I think he he thinks oh, that evil looking foreigner

146
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:38,323
who is in the taylor shop I I don't think I even noticed him the first time and I had to go back and and look at it. It it's a pretty stereotype

147
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:41,931
version of, like the generic middle east.

148
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,285
And I think it's kinda playing on the dynamic of the very paranoid

149
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,491
you know, mid nineteen fifties

150
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:52,523
definitely. So basically,

151
00:17:52,940 --> 00:18:01,284
you know, Scrooge is concerned that he's being per sued for this bar of gold. And and I really like this chase sequence here Austin

152
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:03,059
where Donald leaves him

153
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:05,294
down into this a call

154
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:07,208
through an abandoned factory

155
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:19,206
through a bunch of colbert pipes under fence and and then hiding into a barrel and the stick is that it's where he hides when Daisy comes after him. To mow her lawn,

156
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:28,335
And first off, it's way more trouble probably than just mowing the damn hang on. But but as a kid, I like this little, you know, path this little

157
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:33,614
escape app that you had. And we get this very, like, on settling

158
00:18:34,194 --> 00:18:37,774
image at the end of the sequence where this foreigner

159
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:39,214
is literally

160
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:40,494
sniffing

161
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:43,448
around to try to find Scrooge.

162
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:54,184
It's very weird. Yeah. It's very so weird that it's very... Scrooge screws do that as well. Doesn't he have a nose for money as well? That's true. Yeah. This is

163
00:18:54,564 --> 00:18:55,884
it is like Scrooge.

164
00:18:56,404 --> 00:19:04,517
Everyone smell he stiff out gold, and that's what this weird foreigner is gonna do as well. But, you know, he looks so sinister.

165
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:05,956
Quote he.

166
00:19:06,455 --> 00:19:26,129
He looks so sinister sir. And and his nose is so pronounced that it just looks It looks on unsettling. Mh. Yeah. Which I find very interesting. These sort of stereo there's a lot of stuff in the store that wouldn't fly as we'll see later on well. Oh, yes. They a huge number of stereo yeah in this one.

167
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:27,749
Anyway, on the next page,

168
00:19:28,881 --> 00:20:02,609
the man, the mysterious figures found Scrooge under the barrel and tells me is a keen sense of smell, strong aroma of money. Which is very interesting because, of course, Donald his the bar now Scrooge just nothing on him. So, you know, like Jake's sort of up Scrooge just wondering when going on. And out of nowhere, this man pulls out a little bit of the famed Golden fleece, which of course, gets Scrooge right away, you know? He sort of falls for it... Like I was saying earlier, it's interesting that he just falls for it right away. You know, he doesn't really think too deeply, what's going on here.

169
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,955
You know, it's kind of urine for money takes away any sort of logical way of thinking, which I was found interesting. Right.

170
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:10,609
Yeah.

171
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:14,149
It it's... Scrooge is very credible

172
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:21,204
in a lot of this story. I guess he's prime to be fleece. As it were. And and, yeah, the the weird

173
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:27,884
foreigner starts name dropping all these things from the myth. Right? He says that he doesn't

174
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:32,494
specifically say immediately that it's from the golden fleece. But...

175
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:35,251
But he says that it came from fable.

176
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:39,461
And it... It's from the land of the sleepless

177
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:47,686
dragon and and then it kinda dawn on Scrooge, all of a sudden, and he says that could be real wool from the golden fleece.

178
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:59,229
And basically, this this mysterious guy is saying, how fortunate is that we've met and he's preparing to basically make a bargain with him for

179
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:07,085
more of the golden fleece. You know, they kinda coordinate the details of this deal whilst... Well donald is ea dropping.

180
00:21:08,002 --> 00:21:11,624
And at the end of this page, Austin, we get the first

181
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,384
of this weirdo

182
00:21:13,884 --> 00:21:14,384
tell,

183
00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:21,674
right where he slips up. He says it would mean a voyage to Us, mister Mc talk but and then he,

184
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:28,590
he he come aboard the argo, and we'll talk it over with my sis. I mean brothers.

185
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:33,832
So, you know, Barks is gonna almost go overboard with this where the man keeps, like,

186
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,766
when we meet those siblings,

187
00:21:37,757 --> 00:21:39,294
they're gonna repeatedly

188
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:41,887
almost refer to each others Al sisters

189
00:21:42,463 --> 00:21:42,963
and

190
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:46,832
when they're gonna be giggling all over the place. So box is gonna practically

191
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:50,964
he's gonna practically like sign post it that

192
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:54,064
these are these weirdo are actually women.

193
00:21:54,759 --> 00:22:07,837
And and then the Nephews, Huey, dewey and Louie hop upon Donald he's fine on them. And he he basically is gonna fill that in. Yeah. Donald comes around and nephews he's and he says, I've been watching Uncle Scrooge and a stranger.

194
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:12,819
A guy is trying to sell him the golden fleece, which, of course, gets the wood chuck like

195
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:17,579
super confused. You know, I go down to look at the the ship.

196
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:48,259
And of course, they show up and it's like exactly as it appeared in the book of old miss. Our book of the old miss is enough use call it, which is interesting, like, I always like the treasure on dynamic works very well because the wood shocks with this book of, like, seemingly infinite knowledge are always able to clue in as we're gonna see the reader on kind of what's going on. But, of course, like, Barks can't expect every reader to know the the Golden Flea Smith and everything behind it. Right. He has to do like this very bridged kinda cliff notes,

197
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:58,448
education even if most people are gonna know. It's a lot... It's gonna be a lot of kids first exposure. Right. Exactly. And and Barks does it very well Let you. Seemingly

198
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:47,469
just inserts it in for a page or two. Just the wood checks reading out of their old guide book and everything. So anyway, Donald and the nephews go over to the boat, and they wanna listen in ea job again. And Scrooge is on the boat, and of course, the man who's been following him says mister Meet my sis, I mean my brothers so he slips up again. And even I remember the first time I read this. Of course, I knew what was going on, but I still wasn't able to tell what was act gonna happen. I wonder people who were reading this for the first time could be able to predict, like these people that everyone is figuring our men are just gonna loft spoiler. Cool off all their clothing and just be revealed to be these creepy bird women creatures. You know? Right. Especially if you're reading it in, you know, for the first time with a cover that doesn't really

199
00:23:48,605 --> 00:24:09,119
give it away, you know, that album that I read, Don Roses, does show the Barks keys on the on Don Rosa cover. But, like, it doesn't connect them to these guys. So, like, I I knew just like you. I knew something's what? Something was up. I didn't know exactly what was... You wanna read the the full panel where he says their names as,

200
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:10,638
whatever.

201
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:14,434
Sure. So, yeah. He introduces his sis brothers

202
00:24:14,973 --> 00:24:15,473
as

203
00:24:16,252 --> 00:24:16,752
Sang,

204
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,210
equal Zen,

205
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:20,742
Es said and

206
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,978
Y, and he mentions his own name is Al

207
00:24:24,737 --> 00:24:40,664
and then another one of them mentions they are they dot I mean sons of the queen of sequel. So that's how they kind of introduce themselves and they're doing the classic. They g with the beard and and sort of you know, doing the little hand thing, rubbing the hands together. Right.

208
00:24:41,504 --> 00:25:00,444
So there's there's a lot to take in here off and so, I guess first off. The dynamic is we've got shift eva looking foreigner. That... That's pretty unfortunate. It, but but it's definitely kind of a re of the time. I guess it is worth noting that they are in disguise for for what it's worth. Number two,

209
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:03,639
the the made up name, it definitely

210
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:13,994
sounds like it could be a country and it could be these, like, foreigner hundred names. You know? So this construction that Barks has come up with it it it's definitely

211
00:25:14,491 --> 00:25:19,512
stereotypical, but it's also very effect And number three, this sequence is really

212
00:25:20,088 --> 00:25:33,365
really creepy. Like, if I step back and remember the first time that I read this, which would have been probably Al age like nine or. I remember, like being very creeped out because they they looked they look gi

213
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:37,129
like they're planning something

214
00:25:37,665 --> 00:25:40,397
horrible, you know? And right. And these like

215
00:25:40,734 --> 00:26:06,895
interject, Sparks is really going overboard signal that they've got something nasty planned. Oh... I think this is a good one to kinda step out of my own head and try to remember what I was like to read it the first time. Because this is this a creepy sequence. And and basically, the dynamic of the next page is that they, you know, Scrooge in them continue to... They talk business as he says. And we see a little bit of cons

216
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:10,006
between the sons of Sea

217
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:21,339
planning to sail back to call this. So, you know, we know that they're on the up and up about at least because they're they're referencing it amongst themselves and whisper voices.

218
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:26,703
But just as they're getting ready to... We figure probably kid kidnapped Scrooge

219
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:30,436
the nephews who have been ea dropping on this business

220
00:26:31,108 --> 00:26:32,726
spot this really

221
00:26:33,144 --> 00:26:34,202
creepy looking

222
00:26:34,580 --> 00:27:24,828
shadow. And and the Nephew just describes it as a big bird came out on deck and sauce and dart back a bird with a funny head. I don't know about you Austin, but I I really think that out of context, that shadow is freak that out of is super freaky. And you mentioned people who had read the comic originally with, like, just the gag cover having zero clue about what was really going on. I had zero clue was going on here. So, you know, for someone who might have had the rosa to cover with the, you know, the and everything you might have been able to clear yourself in, but, like, there's is not a lot of resemblance between these creepy brothers that are you know, calling screws right now in this bird shadow. So for the gag covered is very effective, you think back for Barks to, like, sort of heat readers still very much

223
00:27:25,207 --> 00:28:09,654
not in the nose. That makes sense? Right You know? Yeah. I think that's a great point. So anyway, on the next page, the nephews cl donald on what's going on. Of course he says, all birds have funny heads. I I like that Al lot. That is funny. You know, Scrooge is sort of supposing some things wrong because he's not as eager to get back into it. Now the jig is really up with these guys because they're whispering behind his back and saying, love to have our rich play thing come back later. When his buying relatives aren't along to raise Cane. They figured they'll send them away. They say their fee to take him the Golden fleece is five bars of gold Scrooge. You know what I'll think about it. We go to a little bit later. Where he's walking along with the net his nephews.

224
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:25,300
And they're like, you're not really gonna sail with him or you But screws is saying, well, you know, I'll have... If I'll have to, I'm gonna go get that fabulous fleece. So it's interesting because the nephews in donald are usually up for the adventure. But here they're sort of suspecting more.

225
00:28:25,794 --> 00:28:49,799
Like Donald usually not one to understand, like, the true danger of a situation. Whereas his Scrooge is. So kind of interesting to see, like, the opposite in the dynamic and, like, sort considering what's really right and what's wrong. What should they do and not. Yeah. Definitely. I think that's a good point. It... It's interesting too that, like, Scrooge is talking about how he's kinda eager for this adventure to be like, Jason

226
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:51,997
after the Golden fleece.

227
00:28:52,735 --> 00:29:01,671
And and he's not usually motivated by the desire to for adventure. You know, in in these stories in Barks stories, at least duck,

228
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:16,530
the series kind of like changes that so that he just he loves the quest, but in general, I don't think that's really what he's usually about. Right. And and I'm perceiving that he's been just a little bit witch by his, like, actual

229
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:22,319
view of that golden wall. Right. Because because in the next couple of pages, they're gonna kinda

230
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:38,619
him on by showing him that. Right Awesome know to that, like, what you were saying about, I'm not being very eager for adventure. It is true that in most of the stories, the adventure isn't, like, something they choose to go on. Right? It's usually a result of some

231
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:48,959
mishap or screw up and they have to go on it to retrieve, you know, this item or this amount of money. But here they're sort of willingly throwing themselves into it and it is interesting

232
00:29:49,297 --> 00:30:05,799
to see why like so eager. Yeah. Least Scrooge just. The Nephews, they're really... They're they're only interested kinda holding him back. That... That's actually what kind of annoyed me about the second duck series is that they they kinda of re con them and being like, always down for an adventure

233
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:14,948
but but like, it was really about the treasure hunt. For Scrooge. That's just my kind of side now. So, you know, basically,

234
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,984
the the the kids they go back to kind of

235
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:28,916
try and figure out more. You mentioned that they're the wood checks. Right? They're gonna they're gonna consult their guide book. And they're kinda remembering what they know

236
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:30,207
about the ancient

237
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:35,670
story. Think have a real eclipse notes version that says Jason was sent to fetch

238
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:38,954
the Golden fleece from the palace of Ares and.

239
00:30:40,452 --> 00:30:41,471
And then they

240
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:54,529
very quickly mentioned after scatter some bird like creatures and knocking out a sleepless drag. Right. So that's gonna kinda set up the rest of the story, just that one little panel.

241
00:30:55,343 --> 00:30:59,418
And then he took the fleece back to Greece and married a which named Na india.

242
00:31:00,297 --> 00:31:06,129
And boy, that part of the story, the the later parts of it getting up being really sad and gruesome.

243
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:11,729
And so they they try to find out more in the guide book, and Donald Ducktales screws to his office.

244
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:13,122
And when Scrooge

245
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,338
unlocks his office,

246
00:31:16,235 --> 00:31:19,828
he is shocked to see a Sequel Al.

247
00:31:20,786 --> 00:31:23,059
Already relax at his desk.

248
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,339
And

249
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:37,444
and Sequel Al is being this really big weirdo though talking about how you know, this is easy for someone. I I came in through the window, a feet, which is easy for someone from August.

250
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:40,359
And basically you sense Austin

251
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:41,239
that

252
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,059
Al is there because he wants to real in Scrooge

253
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:52,037
he wants to hold up that fleece and kind of enchanted him by how how weird he is and

254
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:56,140
and just dang that fleece under his nose.

255
00:31:56,699 --> 00:32:04,284
And and it works He gets screwed a little bit in enchanted and he gets him to follow him out of the office.

256
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:06,644
And, you know, Donald

257
00:32:07,064 --> 00:32:09,564
prepares to tail after him and

258
00:32:11,637 --> 00:32:15,352
You wanna tell us about what happens next or if you have any comments?

259
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:16,551
Sure. Yeah.

260
00:32:18,044 --> 00:32:22,419
I just find an interesting that Donald cares this much about Scrooge. Usually. He so

261
00:32:22,758 --> 00:32:26,135
Scrooge is so hard on Donald. You wouldn't think he's not gonna be

262
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:31,689
that quick to get all the help he needs from his, you know, Nephew, but apparently, he does. But anyway,

263
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:35,749
nice bit of fore foreshadowing and Donald gets hit by some

264
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:39,484
flying object that knocks him over the head and only

265
00:32:39,864 --> 00:32:42,344
one black feather floating down.

266
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:46,691
You know, so we've had the strange bird light creature reference in this,

267
00:32:47,028 --> 00:32:51,592
and it's all very nicely for foreshadowing wants to come. And here's that little

268
00:32:52,544 --> 00:33:00,064
sort of cliff note version of the whole golden fleece thing that I was mentioning earlier, the exposition that he needs sort of that the story.

269
00:33:00,758 --> 00:33:15,977
You know, Made got sore at, Jason and get back to C taking the golden police with or they say. So they sorta of run through it. She hung it in the hall of that echoes, then the bird light creatures came to live in Cold kiss and the sleepless drag and resumed his vigil.

270
00:33:16,776 --> 00:33:17,276
So

271
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:21,460
you know, they kind of run through it real fast just to give you that basic understanding.

272
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,496
And while they're doing all of that,

273
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:29,002
sequel Al is already on the boat with sc and they're already

274
00:33:29,381 --> 00:33:32,258
getting ready to sail with Donald close on their trail.

275
00:33:33,257 --> 00:33:35,635
Right. Can can you tell from the text

276
00:33:36,189 --> 00:33:39,349
Lost where they must have had Barks, we let it.

277
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:48,538
Bird light creatures sounds pretty awkward or funny birds or whatever. I think I think they must have been reading about herpes fees originally.

278
00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:55,916
Yeah. You know, most. Because I know a lot of it had to be edited for the publications. Right.

279
00:33:56,754 --> 00:34:02,980
And the nephews do get that realization or or the one who saw the the shadow says, he katz.

280
00:34:03,433 --> 00:34:05,807
That's what I saw board the argo,

281
00:34:06,224 --> 00:34:09,077
but but the others, you know, are skeptical still.

282
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,030
Sure.

283
00:34:13,097 --> 00:34:17,478
And and again, all of this is deeply on unsettling.

284
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:19,744
This whole time. Right? We've got

285
00:34:20,323 --> 00:34:29,304
I I think this is really exciting too, and it would be cool to have this put to screen where you see the Nephews kind of frantically learning as much as they can.

286
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,339
While Donald is desperately

287
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,199
running to the boat. You wanna keep telling us about Donald boarding the boat?

288
00:34:37,053 --> 00:34:45,016
Yeah. So, of course, the they find him out, the brothers seat roles find him out. They sort of pull them on board by

289
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:50,669
came to the neck which looks super painful. They call them mister Guac face. So now the

290
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:53,169
the humiliation is really through the roof.

291
00:34:54,824 --> 00:35:02,124
Anyway, Don gets pulled into the room with sc, and he's just going over his five bars of gold fee

292
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:13,787
But Donald is saying, you know, there's something fishy about this ship, and he's trying to pull him off. But as Scrooge know just of course, doesn't listen to Donald because why would you? He's pulling out as five Barks of gold,

293
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:19,719
and the brothers take the gold and throw it right mind Austin reading readings Scrooge,

294
00:35:20,557 --> 00:35:24,632
word balloon there and their response because it's really well set up. Oh, sure.

295
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:35,515
Which the one in the I paid for Scrooge says I've paid. Yeah. Scrooge says, I paid for my voyage with five bars of gold.

296
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:38,942
I'm sure these men respect their obligation.

297
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:50,016
So the brothers grabs the gold they say, oh, sure. Sure. We respect it. Like this and they throw all the gold right out the window, you know, which of course, Scrooge screws like absolutely

298
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:50,794
fine.

299
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:56,269
Through your gold overboard, why? Brother say because we have no use for gold and,

300
00:35:56,689 --> 00:36:25,445
and this is This is really trippy. We have no use for these garments either and we get a super creepy panel. Rather start taking off all their clothing one of them even throws away a mass. This is why really weird a mask of their face with the big nose and the beard and the mustache. And they all start un addressing and they reveal themselves as those creepy bird light creatures, the Barks keys, and this is a really weird panel.

301
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:26,878
They are,

302
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:34,839
like they look kind of the same in the face, but they have this short black hair and, like, a pony tail,

303
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:36,034
earrings,

304
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:40,787
red and yellow earrings and like, big bird feet and wings.

305
00:36:41,206 --> 00:36:47,390
And, of course, you have the classic, like hat jumping off the head for Donald and Scrooge in the corner who are absolutely

306
00:36:48,008 --> 00:36:48,567
terrifying. Right.

307
00:36:49,485 --> 00:37:03,399
This has gotta be one of Barks best like reveal ever. Right? It it really bears repeating how on unsettling this is and and it's kicked off with that great moment where they just Al

308
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:16,185
throw screws bars of gold. Out the window. We... We as the reader knows something has gone horribly wrong when we see that, It's such a great shocking moment to us and Scrooge.

309
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:30,342
Then when they, like, dis drove that way, and then we see them, they're really meant to look like a cara of an unattractive woman too. You know, I think I think Barks is generally... It's not a kind

310
00:37:31,397 --> 00:37:37,339
representation of kind of femininity throughout the rest of the story. Here. Right. Because... Because these...

311
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,979
I would say that they're really meant to depict kind of a like

312
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:42,899
unpleasant

313
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:44,339
s

314
00:37:45,053 --> 00:37:52,856
woman who's focused on cooking and gossip and competition. And I mean, you know, their their herpes

315
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:58,943
but but the point is that they're just really their women first. That's why they've been like, giggling

316
00:37:59,642 --> 00:38:23,664
we're where we are supposed to see them. Has women. Right. And it's funny you mentioned s ish woman because when I was looking into the Harp large sort of debacle, the actual definition for a Harp under Mer Webster is s woman. Right. Interesting. Right. Yeah, I wonder if it was, like, crossed wires because I've never heard of it as a reference

317
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:37,038
for a a street walker process do, but I've heard it as like an un really unpleasant woman. I'm pretty sure even in other Barks stories that someone, like uses the word hard for for a woman. And that'd be very So

318
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:48,792
that that page continues with the kids still, you know, the reader knows what's going on. But here's where the kids figured it out. They read that travelers near the region of ancient call

319
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:51,190
believe that the strange birds

320
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,600
sometimes called Barks keys

321
00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:59,885
still live there. So I think that's our first time that we've actually seen the word Barks in this. Right? Mh.

322
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:10,394
And they go on to read that wild giggling has been heard on moon list nights in the valley of the mists and natives have found huge bird traps and their sheep folds

323
00:39:10,774 --> 00:39:14,874
And then another Nephew has kind of su out the little backwards

324
00:39:15,214 --> 00:39:15,714
writing

325
00:39:16,214 --> 00:39:18,314
basically, the the the reversing

326
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:33,298
trick. This is a fun trope. Right? I can't remember if I had seen it coming or I knew there was something weird about those names. But he says I wrote those guy's names backward on this piece of paper and it spells Barks.

327
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:39,395
So So sea crawl, we've just learned the word Barks. So maybe we... Maybe we haven't...

328
00:39:39,733 --> 00:39:50,055
We haven't figured it out. I think if Barks have gotten to use heartbeat like he wanted too, which would also look kind of like suit foreign. We might have recognized it more easily.

329
00:39:50,575 --> 00:40:13,035
And they go through, and they say Ep Sang is the la agnes and Zen is La Nes and Al is Ella eli and so on. The nerve of them. Right. Yeah. I... You mentioned the sort of if you could tell whether or not that reverse same thing was coming. I certainly couldn't. I mean, I know it was one of my first Barks stories, but like the reveal of the

330
00:40:13,532 --> 00:40:20,811
and the name, like, everything really floor me when I first read this one. It's a really good. It's a really well

331
00:40:21,164 --> 00:40:31,070
instructed reveal. Whether you see it coming or not, I think it's got a a great impact in this story. Yeah. He he foster such a unsettling

332
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:35,670
atmosphere. All, like, in this first half. It's weird

333
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:36,510
Austin.

334
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:37,430
The

335
00:40:37,825 --> 00:40:48,978
second half when you actually get there is like less on unsettling, than all the build. Right. I actually was gonna bring this up. It's in my notes but it's like I was so

336
00:40:49,357 --> 00:41:14,361
disappointed upon reread because in my mind, what lasted in my memory was that first half with this great reveal and this, splash panel on fourteen of the the Barks, like flying away with the boat, which is really weird. But then we sort of file into the second half, and it's like wait a minute. This is almost like a different story, you know? Yeah. It's this weird. We're gonna enter into this weird domestic

337
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:27,246
dispute thing. Yeah. Like almost like it would have worked with daisy and, like, her friends back at home, you know? Like, Huey, know at Al. Yeah. Parts of this definitely feel like a daisy story.

338
00:41:28,162 --> 00:41:36,891
Tell us about that splash panel though because it is great. Yeah. And this is a this is a very cool panel. They... The Nephews run off, of course, they realize everything.

339
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:52,500
They go down to the dock, but they see the keys in the distance. This is really cool. Above like this the moon or the sun and they're flying away with the boat attached to like, their wings. And it's all in silhouette. So it's very creepy.

340
00:41:52,839 --> 00:42:08,633
Of course, one of the nephews finds a note on the side from Donald where prisoners of Barks save us, you know, and they're thinking about how to save them and one of the nephews just would cost thousands as Al as to travel a lot far. Another one says, and we're broke. The only way we can get there is to swim.

341
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:18,591
So, of course, one of them just dies in starts swimming. Hey, you wild Hiro. I didn't mean that we could swim, guys and the water says I wasn't swimming the ocean

342
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:35,810
I was diving in to see what was shining on the bottom, and it's just what I thought it was. Gold, five bars of it just waiting to be fished out of the drink. So of course this is cleverly structured by Barks so as bars Al we're thrown out, couple pages later and hour coming yeah. That's an extremely

343
00:42:36,365 --> 00:42:36,865
tightly

344
00:42:37,205 --> 00:42:43,905
constructed and and funny engaging seats. Yeah. I I really like it. So I I noted

345
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:56,482
Austin that when the nephews see what's happened with the Barks departing, one of them says brother, this is one time we really missed the boat. And and, you know, that's an old... That's an idiom.

346
00:42:56,821 --> 00:43:12,290
That's an expression in English, and it it occurs to me, like, literally right now that I wonder if Barks decided do that because there's gonna be another idiom that's gonna be very important at the end of this story. The pulling the wall over. Over the eyes.

347
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:18,125
Yeah. Al might be interesting. You might be right on the. Okay. You know but Austin, it's weird.

348
00:43:18,464 --> 00:43:20,645
That like what I think we're fifteen

349
00:43:21,105 --> 00:43:26,647
pages are so into this story. We've had most of the first half and it's been entirely

350
00:43:27,264 --> 00:43:35,535
confined to Inducks and this set up. He really... Lets the beginning of the story breathe. Yeah. Sorta takes his time with it. Yeah. So

351
00:43:36,249 --> 00:43:42,463
we see the Nephews making their preparations to travel to c us c

352
00:43:42,882 --> 00:43:44,940
and they transfer to a helicopter.

353
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,272
In Asia minor. So we're in, like the Turkey,

354
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:50,189
you know, the Europe and Turkey

355
00:43:50,528 --> 00:43:51,748
kind of border.

356
00:43:52,406 --> 00:43:58,751
And and they reference having some special weapons for battling the Le along with their junior wood checks.

357
00:43:59,368 --> 00:44:17,950
And Barks kind of takes care of getting any other support. He hand waves it by saying no police will ever believe our story. And and now they head to the valley of the miss. Where the pilot says that, you know, they will be the first person in sent to enter that creepy place.

358
00:44:19,044 --> 00:44:22,684
Not not our first time being in a Al of miss and A Barks

359
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,464
in a Barks story.

360
00:44:24,804 --> 00:44:25,364
Oh, yeah.

361
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:29,079
Right. Interesting. Yeah. Barks really enjoys

362
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:32,239
like, fog as an element of mystery.

363
00:44:32,659 --> 00:44:35,812
And and it works great. And we've seen it in plain awful.

364
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:40,445
Golden helmet itself, I had a great fog seen

365
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:48,650
So so here, we are in an entire value of it, and they have the pilot dropped them off near

366
00:44:49,204 --> 00:44:57,575
prepared to give get dropped off near some old ruins that they see. And if give us any comments or or tell us about about Barks headquarters

367
00:44:57,888 --> 00:45:03,568
Yeah. We'll jump right into the next page because this is really where it gets sort of a peculiar

368
00:45:04,025 --> 00:45:04,525
but.

369
00:45:05,794 --> 00:45:14,016
Very cool art wise because I really like the fog sort of background effect. We getting a couple of select panels here. U.

370
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:21,890
Anyway, we cut to Donald and Scrooge as prisoners of the Barks. They're up and like. Some very cool

371
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:29,338
tree stump like nest, that's like, way up in the sky, of course, the are flying around and, like, the classic

372
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:41,759
shaking hands and laughing and They're all happy because they're successful trip to your country to find a rich taste. They found the first sucker that fell our for our golden fleece story.

373
00:45:42,733 --> 00:45:45,707
Taste or, like, what are they talking about? You know? Right.

374
00:45:46,763 --> 00:46:10,576
So they're all laughing and they're very excited and Donald says I noticed that they called you taste. I hope they didn't mean that to refer to refer to your flavor. Scrooge says I noticed that they called me a sucker. I know what they mean by that. I'm glad you. I'm glad you highlighted. That's a good line. Yeah. Scrub course Scrooge is angry because there's no golden fleece. Or at least he thinks until the Barks tells him oh, yes, there is

375
00:46:10,993 --> 00:46:25,899
italian right over there in the ruins of that Al, but you couldn't get to it. Even if we let you go and, of course, it's a revealed that there's a big dragon and he hiss and scares the crap out of Scrooge donald up in the Nest. They're left furious. Right.

376
00:46:26,896 --> 00:46:33,874
Hey. So Austin. You... I it's just occurred to me. You're reading uncle scratch number twelve. So you've got the

377
00:46:34,254 --> 00:46:39,529
kind of on panels. Don't show. Because this is the sequence where the Barks keys

378
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:42,289
he had to like, modify the lara keys

379
00:46:43,029 --> 00:46:59,249
because they looked a little bit too luna. Right? Holy cow. I've never seen that before. Yeah. So the the... The glad stone for the album, I think that was the first time that they had the restored art. But it's worth seeing. It's they they do look really...

380
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:05,829
They do look insane. I don't think it's like I don't think there was any reason to censor. But... But they look.

381
00:47:06,444 --> 00:47:06,764
They look.

382
00:47:07,484 --> 00:47:13,224
They look. They're just... They're just like laughing at what a supper for just been. But it's really great our work.

383
00:47:13,524 --> 00:47:14,519
And I I left

384
00:47:15,018 --> 00:47:16,316
I love how they

385
00:47:16,655 --> 00:47:20,247
they're really just delighted what a sucker they've made of him.

386
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,661
And so on the next page, you know, we've got Donald.

387
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:29,754
We've got Scrooge really doing and having been sucker and angry Al his predicament.

388
00:47:30,174 --> 00:47:35,609
And he threatens them he says I wanna go home, Let me out of here before I forget that your ladies

389
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:37,529
and we

390
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:47,279
we get a very weird scene where one of the Barks keys puts him over her knee and span him. Like he's a naughty little boy. So, like,

391
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:54,981
we're we're kind of reference. We're kinda figuring out that, you know, they're here at their pleasure. They really are prisoners.

392
00:47:55,837 --> 00:47:58,969
But they're they're always being depicted as

393
00:47:59,306 --> 00:48:01,601
unpleasant ladies. You know, there's never

394
00:48:01,914 --> 00:48:05,790
any more any other hint of menace other than that.

395
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:34,389
And very interesting. It's playing off like all the stereotypes like women who, like Barks, their kids and courses we're gonna see like women who are awful cooks and and women, like, all these things that are just so crazy, like it's just so shocking to read in, like, sort of modern and society, you know, and, like, all the standards have changed and stuff. Right. It's it's It's kind of a vodka of the old like cat skills canadian, you know, take my wife, please.

396
00:48:35,604 --> 00:48:46,430
So, you know, the the lowercase keys tell them to sit tight until we have something ready for you to taste. And when screw asks about that, that, you know, they say, that's a secret and we get more of that

397
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:47,267
madden

398
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:56,136
tackling giggling that they're constantly doing. Right. And at this point, like this is spence and the thrill of that first half is still very

399
00:48:56,473 --> 00:48:59,127
much so still there because the tasting

400
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:15,868
could be anything. Like Barks is already sort of tripped up the standards and the expectations by having this whole gang of villains being turning from men to women. So, like, you're not really sure what do expect anymore. Yeah. We're totally off balance.

401
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:18,302
Yeah. It gets very

402
00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:32,444
disappointing with this whole taste reveal is just exactly what it sounds like really. I I I agree. It's it's a little... I love this story, but it it is a little bit of a lab. Yeah. Because it could be so many other things. Right? Anyway,

403
00:49:32,944 --> 00:49:57,029
donald and screws are up there in the Nest in there. Thinking back to the old myth about how the Barks kept prisoners for years and every time they would sit down to eat, they would put awful tasting things on the prisoners plate. Par at putting is what screws calls one of the things being which throws him into it ti because he apparently hates par sn

404
00:49:57,729 --> 00:50:05,389
which is a bizarre thing day, I suppose. Do you have any idea, Mark if that's like, part of an original myth? Like, did they actually

405
00:50:06,104 --> 00:50:14,813
I I didn't look this up specifically, but I'm I'm like ninety nine percent confident that there's no mention of par sn

406
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:37,283
and in, you know, he he he's not totally off base here. Right? Because the, like, The specific part of the myth is that they had king... Oh, man. What was the King's name? I can't routine whatever. They they depicted this in the in the Ray Harry House movie too, where this king would have... In fact, they would have banquet

407
00:50:38,194 --> 00:50:39,452
of wonderful

408
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:47,489
looking food. Set out for him. But every time he tried to eat it, the Barks keys would come and like

409
00:50:48,029 --> 00:50:52,009
remove it and destroy it and he would have to, like, subs

410
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:54,229
off the little crumbs and remnants.

411
00:50:54,644 --> 00:50:59,784
Of the food. So so they don't actually feed him grow stuff. They prevent him from eating

412
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:09,148
delightful stuff. His is how the actual myth goes. So boxes has massage it a little bit for his own and. I do like the...

413
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,505
This goofy

414
00:51:10,962 --> 00:51:11,401
Scrooge

415
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:23,279
tray. Right? Where he hates par sn. Yeah. I don't like the rest of the the, like, cooking competition aspect of it. But but I do think it's funny that's Scrooge has this one specific

416
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:24,479
root vegetable

417
00:51:24,979 --> 00:51:25,479
hayes.

418
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:41,119
Right. Just like this obscure food just shows up for no reason is like this big problem. Anyway, screws and donald while they're fret over that, the nephews have just landed and their helicopter just sort of shoots out of the scene off to the side. And

419
00:51:41,499 --> 00:51:52,934
the Nephews are kind of just investigating the ruins, and we get a cool panel with the couple Barks and vans cheeses and if he's put it flying around. And they hear a couple noises over from

420
00:51:53,434 --> 00:52:07,494
the echo echoes and the here. You know, that dragon and that Scrooge on we're hearing earlier, which, of course terri the nephews as well. Yeah. I like that. I like the image, a lot of their like, duck feathers, their hair standing on end.

421
00:52:08,114 --> 00:52:15,380
And their fear of the dragon and then how one of them says golly. We never figured on him being still around caucus.

422
00:52:16,036 --> 00:52:21,003
Again, you know, Barks is is still amp off the kind of like, un unsettling

423
00:52:22,073 --> 00:52:26,559
creepy nature. It's... It's nice that this is gonna be a kind of a halloween approximate

424
00:52:27,095 --> 00:52:29,548
episode because I think this is pretty appropriate for

425
00:52:30,418 --> 00:52:32,353
Nice. Yeah know. That'll be fitting. So

426
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:38,710
the nephews eventually, you know, they they hide because they don't wanna be seen and all that noise.

427
00:52:39,204 --> 00:52:42,824
And they get to see one of the lara keys and they kind of marvel

428
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:57,230
Al it. One of them calls Al overgrown canary. But but unfortunately, they lose side of before they can follow it back Scrooge and Donald. And I guess, here's where we get the kind of disappointing revolution Austin. Barks

429
00:52:57,748 --> 00:53:02,554
transitions us to a... They're a kitchen in a clear part of the Valley where the

430
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:03,670
are cooking,

431
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,627
food,

432
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:06,038
and discuss

433
00:53:06,537 --> 00:53:11,751
discussing how they could find a rich old duck to be their food taste.

434
00:53:12,504 --> 00:53:15,724
Talking about how he must be used to only the fan

435
00:53:16,224 --> 00:53:16,724
Vi

436
00:53:17,584 --> 00:53:25,165
and and we we learned pretty quickly that they've had this lifelong argument over who is the best cook? And we get...

437
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,713
We get a little comedic reference to their recipes

438
00:53:29,703 --> 00:53:30,203
being

439
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:39,808
disgusting the first of several where one of them says quit bumping my sterling arm, you've caused my towed to mar to stick to the skill.

440
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:43,022
I do like the goofy recipes,

441
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,272
Austin, even if I don't like the overall premise of it.

442
00:53:47,950 --> 00:54:02,594
Sure. Of course. There there are a couple things to like about it, but this is where it starts to take that really weird turn into these horrifying creatures who capture people alive and take them back to their ancient ruins are now, like cooking

443
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:06,274
and, like, chatting it up, you know, which gets a

444
00:54:06,934 --> 00:54:12,254
Just kinda peculiar. So anyway on the next page, we find them talking and apparently,

445
00:54:12,614 --> 00:54:13,114
whoever

446
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:21,520
has the best meal, whoever Scrooge to sides is the best cook of the five there are gets to become the queen of the Barks

447
00:54:22,334 --> 00:54:46,157
which, of course excites them all. Actually, one of them starts to get thinking and says, I'm gonna win that owner even if I have to cheat a little bit to do it. So they run off, she runs off sister agnes is this one and goes over to sc and gives him a bit of a business deal she puts it. She says it's agreed then that if you select my recipe is the best, I will allow you to escape from.

448
00:54:46,829 --> 00:55:11,491
Screwed agrees to it, and she says besides, if you will eat all of my discs just to floor my sisters, I will grant you another favor. I'll tell you how you can bypass the sleepless dragon and make off with the golden fleece, which, of course, gets Scrooge donald very excited and sister agnes flies off. And even at this point in the story, like, I could tell what the dish was gonna be made of and

449
00:55:12,881 --> 00:55:14,436
where it's gonna go from here.

450
00:55:15,273 --> 00:55:18,404
Right. I mean, it's only been a couple of pages

451
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,255
since he name dropped.

452
00:55:21,229 --> 00:55:34,409
Heating par snip. I almost... I wonder if it might have been better if he had introduced the par snip somehow in the first part of the story. First part of the story, but that might have been tricky to kinda shoot horn in.

453
00:55:35,467 --> 00:55:35,967
So

454
00:55:36,306 --> 00:55:57,980
pretty quickly here and we come to the food tasting ceremony portion of the story. Okay. So I... I've already made clear that I don't really like this overall premise that much. But I will admit. I do like how it actually plays out. Right? Like like it's it's very funny how we get this sequence

455
00:55:58,676 --> 00:56:00,133
of the Barks keys

456
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:01,250
introducing

457
00:56:01,747 --> 00:56:03,842
their their horrible dishes

458
00:56:04,633 --> 00:56:06,770
Donald and Scrooge have some really

459
00:56:07,188 --> 00:56:10,202
great gruesome and expressions that the terrible smells

460
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:18,513
ema from the Barks kitchen. And and so Barks fa sets per edition in front of him and lovingly

461
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:24,828
introduced is it as current Root rhubarb pull told with hurdle the milk queen sauce.

462
00:56:25,326 --> 00:56:28,298
And Scrooge is face and his thought balloon

463
00:56:28,715 --> 00:56:32,225
saying shutter. That... That's an awesome panel. It might be a pick of mine.

464
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:39,161
I wonder Austin if this... Like, if you have you ever gone back and, you know, seeing how the Internet will highlight?

465
00:56:39,498 --> 00:56:47,350
Some of the terrible old recipes from this sarah? Mh. I wonder if that's list is, like, just making fun of some of the random

466
00:56:47,927 --> 00:56:51,157
experimentation the house wise were encouraged to deal around this time.

467
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:52,709
It

468
00:56:53,405 --> 00:56:59,331
that actually sounds like the best fit for it. Because otherwise, it just seems weird that there more of these offers.

469
00:57:00,004 --> 00:57:02,822
Because there was a lot of weird post war

470
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:03,661
cooking

471
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,838
experimentation going on. Mh.

472
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:17,322
And and while Scrooge is choking this down, you know, one of them. I like that he's brisk about this. He doesn't have each one served them. He just has two of the other le

473
00:57:17,714 --> 00:57:21,165
talking about their dishes, One of which is su

474
00:57:21,503 --> 00:57:23,997
sour brat with vin gravy.

475
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:37,060
Then best he, no, he'll love my Barks biscuits more. And Ina nes does get to serve her famous toss tumble we'd salad with cod liver oil dressing.

476
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,216
And we do finally get to agnes.

477
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:41,269
Who

478
00:57:41,687 --> 00:57:45,139
remembers their little deal and Scrooge acknowledges.

479
00:57:45,477 --> 00:57:55,455
He is to eat all of this Dish and asked what is it? And predictably, she announces that it's par snip putting and he falls right over.

480
00:57:56,328 --> 00:58:04,352
It's super predictable, but it's it's very funny. I do like it. So what which of those dishes sounds the the least horrible to you Austin?

481
00:58:06,325 --> 00:58:08,384
No. It might be that tumble wheat.

482
00:58:08,924 --> 00:58:19,603
No It might be the Barks biscuits. They don't sound that terrible. Yeah. I think I think it's probably gotta be one of those. I mean, I guess the person that putting on its own doesn't sound so bad.

483
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,431
So Just... I don't wanna be eating any of those anytime soon.

484
00:58:24,283 --> 00:58:25,701
Yeah. Alright. So

485
00:58:26,596 --> 00:58:33,237
a bargain is a bargain as as Barks notes in his narrator box. That's a great error box And

486
00:58:33,669 --> 00:58:37,914
Scrooge does his best. He's very game. He

487
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:38,870
pant

488
00:58:39,246 --> 00:58:40,800
loving it as he eats it.

489
00:58:42,094 --> 00:58:50,209
And Donald gets this great on line. If this acting or for the Academy awards, you'd win every Oscar in the place

490
00:58:50,909 --> 00:58:51,609
it's awesome.

491
00:58:52,309 --> 00:59:02,059
And so, you know, we don't... We transition quickly. Bark doesn't bother with any ceremony here. He doesn't really care about the lara keys at this point. The the

492
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:04,017
queen Queen agnes

493
00:59:04,356 --> 00:59:11,057
tells them that it's their chance to sneak away while the other girls are soaking, and she tells them that the directions,

494
00:59:11,794 --> 00:59:13,491
she tells them where the tunnel

495
00:59:13,844 --> 00:59:18,844
that'll take them beneath the dragon station to the open end of the hall of Echoes.

496
00:59:19,364 --> 00:59:19,864
And

497
00:59:20,164 --> 00:59:22,144
she tells him that the

498
00:59:22,539 --> 00:59:30,492
It's at the inner end where the quote Boomerang stone reverses the echo. So they they run off, and this leaves agnes.

499
00:59:31,004 --> 00:59:32,182
Kind of pondering

500
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,138
her now predicament

501
00:59:34,755 --> 00:59:39,499
as she reflects on the fact that, you know, her sisters are gonna be really mad

502
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:43,095
when they learned that she's let the prisoner

503
00:59:43,434 --> 00:59:49,824
estate. So so she decides to do... I guess, this is the fleece. I guess this is kind of one of the

504
00:59:50,284 --> 01:00:07,784
double cross aspects of it. I mean, the whole thing, the tricking them here is part of it, but there's a lot of crossing and double processing. She adds one more secret to sc about the hall of that echoes. And she thinks that this trick is gonna make cry. I I hero a heroin to her sisters.

505
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:14,110
So she says because it's a dark and whining tunnel, it's you need to find your weight to the fleece by shouting

506
01:00:14,447 --> 01:00:16,660
and listening for the return of the echo

507
01:00:17,077 --> 01:00:23,499
and that the special word is sea crawl. And and, of course, Donald and Scrooge didn't figure out

508
01:00:23,878 --> 01:00:33,920
what the nephews did. Right? So I don't know. I found the whole thing very try with agnes coming up with his plan. And going through with all this far and then Barks just having her like,

509
01:00:34,733 --> 01:00:56,335
maybe I shouldn't and then bringing it in and having her sort of take it back and then having her turn on him. You know? So it all seems like Barks can try on I I agree with you. I I had pretty much the exact same impression this this part of the story. Can we can we maybe agree right now that the first half of this story is dramatically

510
01:00:56,672 --> 01:01:02,009
stronger. Yeah. Than the resolution. The... I I do like the whole story on it

511
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:05,269
Even despite my criticisms here, you know?

512
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:15,809
Mh. But, like, I think the first part of is just so strong. Yeah. First part is definitely stronger. And I do think it drops off especially with the whole

513
01:01:16,147 --> 01:01:16,647
unnecessary,

514
01:01:17,263 --> 01:01:26,902
like, dragon sequence that we're gonna come up to Yeah. Definitely didn't have to be a full thirty two pager, but it is still a pretty good story. Right. Anyway,

515
01:01:27,342 --> 01:01:29,420
you know, without thinking about it any further,

516
01:01:29,874 --> 01:01:42,729
Donald and Scrooge go into the halls and they think, okay, Well, y'all seek roll into this hallway way to see what's going on. And we get nice little panel in the bottom of these old ruins. Right? Feels like very

517
01:01:43,629 --> 01:01:45,309
seven cities of gold or, like,

518
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:48,996
Indiana Jones almost which I think is cool. My little.

519
01:01:49,754 --> 01:01:53,606
So they get to the hallway and they yell sql sequel seat role

520
01:01:54,199 --> 01:02:13,609
the wait for the echo and they put their hand in a ear. Classic, and it comes back of course, screaming Barks is la, which gets the actual Barks keys. You know, all in it ti get up. It's told Mick not trying to get the golden police to the Palace girls. I don't know how they were able to find out it was him and him trying to get the fleece right away. But

521
01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:17,984
anyway, agnes is all excited so they go out in search of him and

522
01:02:19,241 --> 01:02:24,092
donald this is what I really like this Donald and Scrooge trying to get out. And the

523
01:02:24,589 --> 01:02:26,704
just show up with all this food.

524
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:34,780
All these, like old fruits and just start w them knot them. Just knocked them to the floor, which I just found, like, totally weird. Yeah.

525
01:02:36,034 --> 01:02:37,254
It is pretty weird.

526
01:02:38,274 --> 01:02:42,114
So this this previous page had one of my pep peeve Austin,

527
01:02:42,434 --> 01:02:46,949
the the the trope were like someone says something backwards

528
01:02:47,569 --> 01:02:51,069
So, like, if you say sea crawl backwards,

529
01:02:51,864 --> 01:02:56,564
it's not gonna work like that. Right? Like, you can't just

530
01:02:57,264 --> 01:02:58,444
say a word

531
01:02:58,838 --> 01:03:06,803
how it's spelled. It doesn't... You know, if you actually reverse audio, so you have to, like... You have to, like, think about phonetic

532
01:03:07,222 --> 01:03:16,359
how it gets reversed. So let's see. Like, if you said sea first, it it starts with an s sound and Barks keys ends with a

533
01:03:16,817 --> 01:03:22,477
sound. You know what I mean? So like, at the at best, it would be like la.

534
01:03:23,213 --> 01:03:28,632
So anyway, it always annoys me when people think think that it works like that. I do like...

535
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:32,861
It's it is it is very quick and can try to how how

536
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:56,139
large... The queen of the Barks keys just quickly toss off. I am the one that tricked him into this. So we could have some fun. Mh. Yeah. Go ahead. Anyway, it's all on Scrooge being bound by this. You know, food, and of course, enough user to the rescue as they always are they're running out. They have all these sort of supplies and weapons with them. And they're up on the roof of the hallways

537
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:02,519
and they're looking over and when that one nephew he goes well, would you look at that and the other one says, Barks

538
01:04:02,934 --> 01:04:08,200
flying formations like dive bombers, and it's just kind of a peculiar image of, like, the Barks,

539
01:04:08,759 --> 01:04:13,069
like, soaring down, like their b nineteen into, like, the.

540
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:18,029
So they have all these weapons with them and rockets

541
01:04:18,544 --> 01:04:30,359
with pin wheel war, and they light them off and and sort set them out to scare the log keys, but not to hurt them because as they're gonna mention in a little bit, you can't hit a woman. Yeah.

542
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:32,259
And we're continuing

543
01:04:32,959 --> 01:04:39,383
we're continuing that old trope. Right? Like, these are not monsters. They are women first, basically.

544
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:51,576
To Barks and these characters. Right. I do like... I do like that we get one more mention of par nip austin is that's one of the foods that they get dive bombed with. U nice. I actually miss that originally.

545
01:04:52,015 --> 01:04:57,211
Anyway, we get a a bit of a neat little fighting sequence between the Nephews and the Barks.

546
01:04:57,809 --> 01:05:01,989
And they're throwing up the the rockets to keep lighting them, but

547
01:05:02,409 --> 01:05:16,109
They... The Barks pickup handful of rocks, I guess. Yeah. They boy. Are they throwing them down at the nephews or are they they just like, threatening them with... Well, I think I think they're getting ready to when when the nephews

548
01:05:16,768 --> 01:05:21,836
decide they have to, you know, release their secret weapon. Oh, I I guess. It just

549
01:05:22,174 --> 01:05:23,712
seems kinda weird pacing.

550
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:28,914
But, you know, anyway, you you can. You can't get angry at this part of the story for being weird

551
01:05:29,574 --> 01:05:31,592
We've had a lot of weird before this.

552
01:05:32,051 --> 01:05:37,305
Yeah. And to top it all with weird because I think this is super.

553
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:44,991
Super weird and super funny of course, they can't shoot rockets at ladies. So they have to pull up their super secret

554
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:45,870
web

555
01:05:46,544 --> 01:05:48,121
which is tiny little

556
01:05:48,539 --> 01:05:49,039
mice

557
01:05:49,377 --> 01:05:55,599
on balloons. And, of course, because women are so horrified of mice the

558
01:05:56,295 --> 01:06:03,553
fly away, never to be seen again. Right. He's laughing. Yeah. They give a rejoin. He he he.

559
01:06:04,271 --> 01:06:04,771
It's

560
01:06:05,165 --> 01:06:38,282
it's silly. This is not... I I I imagine there are a lot of readers who really like this and are still in use. A lot of old time Barks fans are probably still in use by this kind. Is doesn't really work for me that well these days. But you yeah I understand people people like this kind of thing. Yeah. I I I get it. Of course, like nineteen fifties. It was sort of a narrative drop of course, we've seem like that image in the cartoons of, like, the woman jumping on the table Al the mouse and, like, picking up the skirt and everything. But Absolutely were saying this is

561
01:06:38,674 --> 01:06:54,597
one of those parts of the store it would probably not fly very well, today. It's the trope. And and sometimes tropes are just funny because they're funny, I guess. Sure. Yeah. Exactly. So, you know, we get this sequence where the the nephews finally

562
01:06:55,133 --> 01:07:02,244
reveal that They've they've come along to save Donald and sp. And we get a really quick transition. There's no real reunion here.

563
01:07:03,081 --> 01:07:08,249
I like that they hold up to a little woods check sign, you know, and say it's one of the Inducks

564
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:11,309
patrol of the junior with checks of the world. And,

565
01:07:11,969 --> 01:07:15,964
you know, we get this moment where screwed wants to keep going

566
01:07:16,303 --> 01:07:17,642
and find the

567
01:07:18,221 --> 01:07:24,888
find the police by following the Al echoes, but the nephews say fo on that, they plan to use flood lights and the encompass.

568
01:07:25,306 --> 01:07:32,711
And at this point, Bark needs to wrap the story up. He needs to kinda get it get it going. So there's no no more real

569
01:07:33,144 --> 01:07:33,843
T prevail,

570
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:39,742
They they do. They find the fleece. It's like hanging off this pool looking wall

571
01:07:40,477 --> 01:07:40,875
Scrooge

572
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:42,870
gives a great money hungry

573
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:47,930
lunch towards it. This that this is an image that he captured and in one of the oils.

574
01:07:48,465 --> 01:08:06,020
That looks pretty great. Yeah. And also that Rosa captured in his his glad cover, of course. Right. Yeah. That's the second cover, I guess that Rosa did for this one. Right? Because... Yeah. Right. He did the one with the and then the one with, like, you know, the yeah one from Scrooge Adventures.

575
01:08:06,614 --> 01:08:20,067
I I think I think this one is really indicative of Rosa at the earlier part of his career. I think that one's a lot. Stronger. Yeah. For sure. The the dragon in this one is shown in full and he he looks

576
01:08:20,644 --> 01:08:21,681
almost plastic. Mh.

577
01:08:22,414 --> 01:08:24,353
So, you know, Scrooge just, like really

578
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:33,553
ecstatic and he's kiss the the golden wool, but the dots remind and we've gotta worry about getting out of here. Let's turn around from this dead end

579
01:08:34,051 --> 01:08:36,746
and Scrooge is super excited

580
01:08:37,124 --> 01:08:50,687
to to, you know, see it in the light. In the daylight. And, I don't why don't you take it from here. Sure. Of course. They're are very excited, But I guess not everything has come to a resolution yet because here we come to the most peculiar

581
01:08:51,024 --> 01:09:07,960
add on to the story I suppose this part that didn't have to be here and probably could have been like a separate story entirely on its own where Scrooge is excited and he's got the fleece and we're running out with it. And the nephews and donald on is trail, and they hear an e and a champ.

582
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:17,662
And turns out there's just that big dragon, which is hanging around the corner that just in engulfed Scrooge alive I suppose.

583
01:09:18,699 --> 01:09:29,751
And like, here, we've got that that cool sort of thing where the the dragon was lingering through the whole story. They mentioned him at the beginning and, you know, Donald and Scrooge hurt him, and the nephews

584
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:42,609
them and when, of course, they showed up. And it didn't really play into anything. So now it's coming into play when it's like, very much so out of the readers like short term memory. So it is a cool reveal, and this is nice,

585
01:09:43,065 --> 01:09:44,881
but it's largely

586
01:09:45,218 --> 01:09:50,315
unnecessary as we're as we're gonna see Yeah. Yeah You know right. Probably on all counts.

587
01:09:50,851 --> 01:09:57,447
You know, even the Ducktales have forgotten of about them. Donald like actually kind of four that by saying we clean for forgot about him.

588
01:09:58,287 --> 01:09:59,546
And and we're immediately

589
01:09:59,925 --> 01:10:06,591
reassured that Scrooge is alive because he is yelling for help from the mouth. Of the driving who's looking Al slips.

590
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:11,697
Boy Austin, this dragon and looks like such a big dope.

591
01:10:12,927 --> 01:10:23,905
Looks like such a more... He looks like the Disney dragon from the reluctant dragon in the face. You looks like Al of a threat. Maybe, like, the reluctant dragon or or a little bit keeps

592
01:10:24,245 --> 01:10:24,745
and

593
01:10:25,405 --> 01:10:27,805
pee, it I kinda love him.

594
01:10:28,445 --> 01:10:29,025
He is

595
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:40,422
So over the top weird, he has horns and he has, like, little bells that dang from them, and they see long spin tail and these weird offset legs.

596
01:10:41,059 --> 01:10:46,418
And just this glazed look in his eyes. Because he is the sleepless dragon. Mh.

597
01:10:47,736 --> 01:11:04,418
So, you know, we've got this... We've got a great wood check figuring things out seen here. You know, they've got to... They've got to frantically look through their guide book for some advice on how to make a drag and open his jaw. And this is one of Barks

598
01:11:04,977 --> 01:11:05,477
great

599
01:11:05,856 --> 01:11:16,510
things. His his great tropes, where they're, like, debating over what chat sure they should be in. Could it be on the chapter on dental work? No. It would be under lock.

600
01:11:17,127 --> 01:11:20,956
No. Don't get so rattle. It'll be in the section on unusual beasts.

601
01:11:21,449 --> 01:11:23,785
And they they eventually

602
01:11:24,163 --> 01:11:25,222
get the

603
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:34,065
advice to dump four to ten pounds of pepper into the Dragon nose depending on size of the dragon and to make them open his mouth to sneeze.

604
01:11:35,565 --> 01:11:39,836
Being out of pepper, they find the next closest thing a

605
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:41,751
bottle of mustard

606
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:44,822
that they use for pneumonia plaster.

607
01:11:45,853 --> 01:11:50,221
Lost and that that seems like a treatment that's been lost to

608
01:11:50,878 --> 01:12:03,020
a couple of generations back, I guess. I admit I didn't look up what the heck that is. Yeah. Neither did I I have zero idea what's going on. Yeah fine. That's fine. But this ground mustard

609
01:12:03,335 --> 01:12:06,352
does the trick. They wing it right into his nostril,

610
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:08,469
and he lets loose a big

611
01:12:08,808 --> 01:12:11,586
sneeze and we get this funny little gag where

612
01:12:12,339 --> 01:12:18,650
an nephew you asked Was that on Scrooge screwed that was blown by and Donald says yes I heard him say that as he fast.

613
01:12:19,463 --> 01:12:22,693
It was just funny nice little gag. I suppose. Yeah.

614
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:28,497
Anyway, they find screws in the corner as he was shot out of the Dragon nostril.

615
01:12:29,049 --> 01:12:46,985
And they try to make a break for it with the fleece as the dragon is building up for another sneeze. So they duck into this little, like, hole in the wall I assume they found because they try to make it to the tunnel before he sneeze is. They realized it's too late so they tuck into the hole. And as the dragon and left out the sneeze,

616
01:12:47,520 --> 01:13:06,226
I think it's his toes to cover up the hole, they slam against the the little hole that they came through Right of you know, one of those funny panels of just a bunch of eyes and, like, the black darkness. One of the Ducktales is he's got us trapped in a one door cubby hole. No one says, and keep us here forever. He's that mad.

617
01:13:07,145 --> 01:13:11,961
Now I guess it just they turn on a light or something in the next panel because then you can see everybody

618
01:13:12,634 --> 01:13:16,407
And so the point... Of course, they pull out the guide to see what's going on

619
01:13:16,985 --> 01:13:31,242
how to solve the problem as they always do. And and nephew you find that the guide says to pull the wool over his eyes. And I think Scrooge speaks for me to where he says kind of vague directions. You know? Right.

620
01:13:31,939 --> 01:13:33,875
Yeah. So this is what I had

621
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:35,350
referenced.

622
01:13:36,047 --> 01:13:39,817
That this is like a a common thing for tricking

623
01:13:40,448 --> 01:13:44,375
someone. Right? You pull the wall over someone's eyes. And

624
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:47,762
it is vague, but the nephews know immediately.

625
01:13:48,194 --> 01:14:19,060
What it means to do. And and they grab the fleece from a reluctant Scrooge promising to bring it back. I like this scene a lot, but it it is admittedly a little con contract. Right? Because the dragon is covering the whole they've got to one... One of the nephews uses gotta tickle him to distract while the other sneaks out, I'm like, okay. Well, maybe if you can sneak out, you and figure out something. But... But anyway, this is this ends up being the best way. He he scales his weird backbone

626
01:14:19,735 --> 01:14:26,530
puts the golden fleece over the dragon eyes and the dragon, I guess were meant to think he's so focused on why

627
01:14:27,269 --> 01:14:27,769
the

628
01:14:28,268 --> 01:14:35,840
captive tops that he somehow doesn't notice. And the narrator box tells us that for the first time in Eon, the sleep dragon

629
01:14:36,234 --> 01:14:37,531
can't see.

630
01:14:38,028 --> 01:14:42,395
Because it seems like I guess were meant to see that he doesn't really have eyelids.

631
01:14:43,131 --> 01:14:50,183
The coloring that I've got here has his eyes is very reddish. I don't know if the original coloring showed it that way

632
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:57,451
He his eyes in the the original just like, the classic black pupil and then, like, the white.

633
01:14:58,386 --> 01:15:01,415
Yeah. So that's kind of a nice touch that the Gladstone.

634
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:02,289
Color.

635
01:15:02,828 --> 01:15:04,646
I bet it was Susan Day beach.

636
01:15:05,545 --> 01:15:15,200
No. It's Mike Mc mccormick. Apparently. Well that was a cool choice. Right? Because, like, that that seems like something that would go along with him being the sleep was dragon. But

637
01:15:15,538 --> 01:15:16,038
anyway,

638
01:15:16,614 --> 01:15:21,357
we can guess what happens here. He finally does off he gets a really

639
01:15:21,774 --> 01:15:29,989
satisfying looking sleep and the Ducktales. We get one panel where the duct say fair well to the lara keys and they're gas cookbook.

640
01:15:30,562 --> 01:15:31,900
Has Scrooge sets.

641
01:15:32,317 --> 01:15:32,397
Yeah know.

642
01:15:33,354 --> 01:15:39,557
I'm wasn't very sure what happened to that least They put over his eyes. Did they just keep it there and they had enough left?

643
01:15:40,268 --> 01:15:42,546
I mean, my my read is that, like,

644
01:15:43,825 --> 01:15:49,479
his... He needed that naps so much that even when they took it away, he probably

645
01:15:50,870 --> 01:16:20,109
stay asleep. But I but I guess there's a reason that Barks doesn't show it to us because maybe you can't. It was too hard to show the mechanics of a so gloss over. Something like that. You know. So Why don't you take us home. So, of course, Scrooge is all happy. Goodbye to that old broad call cloth coat that I bought in Scotland in nineteen o two. As soon as I have my new gold coat made from this release, I'll throw this old thread bear rag in the trash can. So we fast forward a little bit to

646
01:16:20,449 --> 01:16:29,044
one month later. Their back home Inducks burgers is and air elevator box puts it and the nephews are Al excited because the golden code is coming back from the taylor today,

647
01:16:29,584 --> 01:16:31,444
and they go over to the office

648
01:16:32,184 --> 01:16:36,169
that I guess to Inducks building and Scrooge isn't in there. So

649
01:16:36,706 --> 01:16:47,711
they kinda around the corner. He's here in the Alley, and they see him putting his old code in the trash can until they talk to him and they realized he's not putting it in, he's taking it out.

650
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:52,135
Because Scrooge screws puts it This dogg on glittering Golden

651
01:16:52,695 --> 01:16:56,329
Macintosh is the coldest contraption I ever had on my back.

652
01:16:57,064 --> 01:17:13,481
Forest Nephew just kinda laugh Al that as we close out the story. So I guess the whole journey was for not then. Right. I I love the ending. I think as far as, like gag endings to adventure stories go, that... That's one of Barks best.

653
01:17:14,591 --> 01:17:26,153
Like, it's it's such a great little bit of poetic. You know, we've gone to all this effort, and that that thing. It's, like, be careful what you wish for. Right? That thing that he wanted the whole time

654
01:17:26,891 --> 01:17:33,670
was not gonna do it for him So... Mh. So I I think... I think it's a great ending. I love the image of him looking

655
01:17:34,366 --> 01:17:36,142
upset in his shiny

656
01:17:36,759 --> 01:17:37,259
glittering

657
01:17:37,876 --> 01:17:54,624
new code. What about you? Yeah. I I mean, I didn't think about it like that when I first read, but I do, like, sort of the careful what you wish for that you mentioned. I didn't think about it like that. And, of course, like, if you think about it in, like, sort of an adventure comedy story,

658
01:17:55,198 --> 01:18:00,319
there's not much better for an ending you can do than just like a funny gag. I suppose.

659
01:18:00,919 --> 01:18:10,487
So even if it's not like fully satisfactory, it is kind of all you he could work with here. So... Yeah. Right. We have... We had to see the codes.

660
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:14,758
Right? We had... We got all this build up. We have see outcome.

661
01:18:15,697 --> 01:18:26,835
We had him go to the trouble or that nice taylor went to the trouble explaining why a real go gold coat wouldn't work. So So, yeah, that that ending, I find very satisfying.

662
01:18:28,529 --> 01:18:30,305
How about the overall

663
01:18:30,658 --> 01:18:34,629
story and I and I know that you and I have talked kind of through

664
01:18:34,968 --> 01:18:40,672
what we think about it. But any any other thoughts, anything you wanna add to Yeah. I know we were both

665
01:18:41,131 --> 01:18:42,989
pretty critical with that weird

666
01:18:43,608 --> 01:18:48,164
second half there. But it is still very good. Still one of the greatest.

667
01:18:49,417 --> 01:18:53,693
And that first half is really good like one of the all time grades.

668
01:18:54,732 --> 01:19:09,283
So yeah, very entertaining some great art. Couple great gag. So, yeah, Definitely a great Scrooge story. Yeah. I'm I'm right there with you, you know, the the lead up to to what happens, the the way the adventure sets off is like this.

669
01:19:09,962 --> 01:19:11,062
Real masterpiece

670
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:12,340
of

671
01:19:12,973 --> 01:19:13,473
creepy

672
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:14,910
atmospheric

673
01:19:15,328 --> 01:19:16,467
unsettling setup

674
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:29,924
And it and take this turn once they actually get there that I'm not Huey, satisfied with flat. But on the whole, I still really like this one. I love how he kind of integrates all this

675
01:19:30,342 --> 01:19:32,037
stuff from the quote actual

676
01:19:32,413 --> 01:19:36,738
myth in a way that's that really works within the Ducktales Universe, I think

677
01:19:37,328 --> 01:19:44,441
I like Scrooge just motivation here. I like the idea of of, you know, the richest man in the world looking for

678
01:19:45,154 --> 01:19:47,214
something that is both a trophy

679
01:19:47,594 --> 01:19:52,149
and just a way to wear some some clothes that really fit him.

680
01:19:52,605 --> 01:20:08,474
I like all the sort of junior wood checks elements of this. You mentioned that it's kind of maybe packed full of one monster too many. And... And like I agree with you, the dragon is a little bit tacked on, but he's so goofy and he's so funny.

681
01:20:08,968 --> 01:20:16,566
And it kinda struck me that it's... It's like the Greek miss. You know, When they go through, it's like monster after monster.

682
01:20:17,302 --> 01:20:17,802
In

683
01:20:18,434 --> 01:20:20,414
It's like monster after monster

684
01:20:20,994 --> 01:20:23,614
in so many of those stories. So

685
01:20:24,354 --> 01:20:25,053
it is

686
01:20:25,767 --> 01:20:34,773
maybe one element too many, and some of the Barks stuff might be a little bit rushed, but... But I also think it kind of fits within, like, the framework

687
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:35,788
of it.

688
01:20:36,187 --> 01:20:36,545
Sure.

689
01:20:37,024 --> 01:20:42,685
Yeah. I I suppose I was a little critical of the dragon because, like, I've been doing a lot of reading of like,

690
01:20:43,658 --> 01:20:44,717
classic literature

691
01:20:45,054 --> 01:21:04,206
lately like novels like American and British novel. So, like, I've been very critical of the overall structure of a story. So, like, to see the dragon and thrown in when I was re reread it for the recording, like everything was perfectly resolved by the end. And then just the drag and showed up and I was like, what the hell going on, you know?

692
01:21:05,005 --> 01:21:15,785
I... Yeah. I don't think you're off based. I mean, I think it's... I think it's totally fair Criticism He's definitely a little bit tacked on. I just... I just... I find him such an dear goof ball.

693
01:21:16,123 --> 01:21:30,081
I agree. I I I actually forgot he was as cool as he wants. He's a cool drag and is what he is. He's not very threatening, but he's a gold dragon. Yeah. He's got a very weird character care design. Honestly, his character design is kinda like nothing

694
01:21:31,234 --> 01:21:32,794
else that Barks is done.

695
01:21:33,554 --> 01:21:33,634
Yeah.

696
01:21:34,394 --> 01:21:36,514
Totally. And then, you know, the the, like,

697
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:40,740
The whole thing has this very retro grade

698
01:21:41,118 --> 01:21:41,618
attitude

699
01:21:42,155 --> 01:21:43,093
towards women

700
01:21:43,471 --> 01:21:47,334
that obviously does not work well these days. But but if you

701
01:21:47,754 --> 01:21:56,794
if you just kind of consume it as an artifact of its time, I'm never gonna like that stuff because it's always... It always feels a little bit lazy.

702
01:21:58,325 --> 01:22:03,610
But but I I get where he's coming from. There there's are still some fun elements

703
01:22:04,306 --> 01:22:04,806
there

704
01:22:05,582 --> 01:22:14,807
in, like, the over the top, cooking dishes, you know? I think there's definitely a little element of maybe bark still being bitter at his...

705
01:22:15,265 --> 01:22:17,641
You know, he's in his third and and

706
01:22:18,259 --> 01:22:27,504
successful marriage now, but I understand that his previous marriage ended pretty poorly. So it it almost feels like an ex wife story or something.

707
01:22:28,024 --> 01:22:30,784
Yeah. No kidding. Actually. That makes a lot of Severino.

708
01:22:31,359 --> 01:22:33,556
Looking at this story and when it was written. Right.

709
01:22:35,274 --> 01:22:38,770
So let's talk a little bit about the general consensus.

710
01:22:39,444 --> 01:22:45,244
This this is a famous Barks story. This is probably like when people talk about Uncle Scrooge

711
01:22:45,924 --> 01:22:56,301
and Carl stories. People probably mentioned this in the first five or ten. I'm guessing. So so it has a very high rating on Inducks, not like an all time, but

712
01:22:56,734 --> 01:22:58,854
you know, in in one of those upper tiers.

713
01:22:59,454 --> 01:23:02,834
It is as of when I looked, it was number forty six

714
01:23:03,174 --> 01:23:05,594
out of all forty two thousand or so stories

715
01:23:05,909 --> 01:23:07,688
good for number seven...

716
01:23:08,426 --> 01:23:10,445
Excuse me. Good for a seven point nine

717
01:23:10,904 --> 01:23:11,404
rating.

718
01:23:11,982 --> 01:23:14,520
Alec like I have a lot of nostalgic

719
01:23:15,194 --> 01:23:24,765
you know, love for this one even if I have a couple problems with it. So, like, despite the flies, the the things that were so well. I think that's... I think that's a pretty fair rating.

720
01:23:25,978 --> 01:23:30,432
Yeah. I I agree eight out at ten is is is pretty solid.

721
01:23:31,690 --> 01:23:34,682
I know people on Inducks who generally

722
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:42,647
rank bark stories are more forgiven than like, you and I might be who are talking about it. For like, an hour and a half for a podcast.

723
01:23:42,986 --> 01:23:43,766
Right. Home.

724
01:23:44,305 --> 01:23:49,899
But no eight auto of attendant is a good place to put it. I mean any stories like classic. Oh, go ahead.

725
01:23:50,833 --> 01:24:01,417
I was just gonna say, of course, it's like an actual treasure hunt, which if you think about it, Barks didn't do as many as those. I think that was sort of wise because of Rosa.

726
01:24:02,354 --> 01:24:12,365
I think there only, like, seven actual Barks hunts for, like you know, like a treasure, like some gold things. So Yeah. You know, Treasure hunts among Barks fans are

727
01:24:13,341 --> 01:24:26,753
a odd item. So naturally the leasing is sort of a a big one. Yeah. That's true That's a good point. The actual treasure items were gonna be iconic. I have to do a tally for the Pop and podcast because that's that's something I Severino thought about.

728
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:34,210
Yeah. So people really like this one. Ducktales, of course, popularized the treasure hunt

729
01:24:34,668 --> 01:24:35,944
and and Ducktales

730
01:24:36,398 --> 01:24:40,490
did adapt this one. This was one of the, like, twenty or so

731
01:24:40,988 --> 01:24:46,854
stories that Ducktales did a pretty straight up adaptation of. Had did you get to see it by chance?

732
01:24:47,593 --> 01:24:50,073
I actually did not. I don't think I did.

733
01:24:50,914 --> 01:24:57,185
So I don't know. I don't think that they did one for the second series

734
01:24:58,403 --> 01:25:01,220
but for the first series, it was

735
01:25:01,933 --> 01:25:13,624
done, and and it was titled the golden fleece exactly like it and I have to say, it was a pretty strong adaptation. It was kind of a launch pad episode, you know, launch pad instead of Donald.

736
01:25:14,403 --> 01:25:17,439
They they briefly shoe horn Ludwig Von drake.

737
01:25:18,014 --> 01:25:20,791
Makes one of... I don't know if he ever appeared

738
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:24,906
in any other episodes, but he's like launch pads psychiatrist,

739
01:25:25,978 --> 01:25:28,435
and launch Pat is worried having these

740
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:32,110
hallucinations because he saw the the Barks keys

741
01:25:33,102 --> 01:25:40,189
So they don't really do any of that sort of mysterious setup. But there's, again, this sort of cooking

742
01:25:40,687 --> 01:25:41,825
competition elements

743
01:25:42,899 --> 01:25:49,039
and they wanna feed him to the dragon at the end. But... But, like, when I watched the le with the lock

744
01:25:50,271 --> 01:25:50,771
adaptation

745
01:25:51,387 --> 01:25:51,887
recently

746
01:25:52,224 --> 01:25:55,355
and back to the Al. I thought those were

747
01:25:55,732 --> 01:26:04,226
much weaker as far as Barks at. Expectations stuff. So I, you know, I I don't love most of the original Ducktales apps this this was a pretty good one.

748
01:26:04,724 --> 01:26:09,194
I think that one of the Barks keys was voice by June four a who is always.

749
01:26:09,774 --> 01:26:21,156
Always great to hear. That's very interesting. I I didn't I didn't fact check that. I'm just talking by my reception. So I wrong. But... Yeah. Yeah. This is not one that ever had.

750
01:26:21,654 --> 01:26:28,873
As far as I know, there was never, like, Rosa didn't do, like any kind of a sequel. He gave so many of the iconic stories

751
01:26:29,251 --> 01:26:30,448
the sql treatment.

752
01:26:31,086 --> 01:26:37,593
But it was a little element of the, like, story called rightful owners by

753
01:26:38,732 --> 01:26:41,150
what's that guy's name who did the video game

754
01:26:44,055 --> 01:26:45,611
One weren't inspector.

755
01:26:46,049 --> 01:27:00,079
Oh, yes. Right. He had a big a big story a few years ago, or I think this was involved. And then... And I think Romano spa used the Barks keys again for some story that I've never read. Oh, Wow.

756
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:15,109
I'll have to look into it that. I don't remember that. Yeah. And and as far as oil paintings, you know, Bark did do two oils for this one. One of them with the moment where they find the golden fleece. That's a very cool

757
01:27:15,449 --> 01:27:17,089
oil or Lit or whatever.

758
01:27:17,544 --> 01:27:22,204
And then another one called menace from the miss, which focuses on

759
01:27:22,544 --> 01:27:25,044
one of the s lara keys, which

760
01:27:25,796 --> 01:27:28,130
You know, there they're such a gruesome subject

761
01:27:28,706 --> 01:27:31,934
for an oil. It's it's a fun one, but I like the other one better.

762
01:27:32,492 --> 01:27:32,771
Mh.

763
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:36,096
Yeah. His oil are always a a treat deal again?

764
01:27:36,854 --> 01:27:37,913
Yes. Definitely.

765
01:27:39,009 --> 01:27:40,665
Let's see. I

766
01:27:40,978 --> 01:27:47,266
think. I think that I got to say pretty much everything that I wanted to about this one austin. And do you have any other

767
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:49,759
thoughts or comments or reflections?

768
01:27:51,094 --> 01:28:04,703
I would say it's a... Not. I would say you covered it pretty well. It's a it's a pretty solid story. Even if we both had our a bit. I think it's still one of my favorites is for for that first half, especially. Right. Yeah. Definitely.

769
01:28:05,262 --> 01:28:05,762
Well

770
01:28:06,342 --> 01:28:10,252
I I really appreciate you joining me for this

771
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:11,090

773
01:28:12,624 --> 01:28:20,304

777
01:28:30,593 --> 01:28:31,093
Adventures,

778

779
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:47,753
And Austin, I have... You already... I think you already highlighted the last bit of dialogue for us, but that's how I've been closing out the episodes. The last couple of months. Do you mind reading that last panel again?

780
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:48,910
Sure.

781
01:28:50,085 --> 01:28:55,985
This dog on glittering Bold And macintosh is the coldest can trap I ever had on my back. Excellent.

782
01:28:56,443 --> 01:28:57,661
Thanks so much, Austin.

783
01:28:58,519 --> 01:29:03,348
Anytime. Yeah? Alright. I think that was great. I that went really well. Yeah. That was nice.

Thank you, and I will let you get to the rest of year your afternoon and evening.
