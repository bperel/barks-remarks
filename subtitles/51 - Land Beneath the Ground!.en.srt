13
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,580
Hang marcel that is. So I've been a fan on my life. Don't think I've ever been in an earthquake meeting.

14
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:30,165
But I did wake up once when there was suddenly a crack in our ceiling. So there might have been one. And I'd probably be a terry because sometimes I do wear both ties.

15
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,320
Excellent.

16
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,800
Alright. How about you same question, Henri?

18
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:51,113
Challenge I'm also... A disney artist. Also draw bunch our stuff in called So been Disney comic and pretty much my whole life. I mean, probably since page four or something. Group Barks and also my.

19
00:02:53,484 --> 00:02:54,920
Making him feel old for happening.

20
00:02:55,891 --> 00:03:07,533
I have been in earthquake once, and we didn't realize until the next day or something because I was actually in in Japan standing in the waiting line for splash mountain and business.

21
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:24,050
In turkey care this and the whole floor was sway really slowly and the lamb moving, and we were noticing it. I wonder if that's the construction of the building or and nobody was responding to whatsoever because jeff before so used to it. And on the way home, the metro,

22
00:03:24,444 --> 00:03:30,609
said that it was cancelled to earthquake. And we still can't and realize it. Then the next day people oh, did you you know

23
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:40,234
that's hilarious. How about it? Which which... Which which ball person would you be? I would say for least, I'm not mixing them up that is

24
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:41,085
because

25
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:45,565
a little better I'm just rolling Al along not being strong, I guess.

26
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:51,370
So the fermi are the the press. And the carries are the rollers. Oh. So we have two

27
00:03:52,027 --> 00:03:54,020
ruined my reputation as support team.

28
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:56,753
Okay. Excuse me that I normally

29
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,298
the but exactly. And they... And they have a a pretty goofy fun name and Dutch. We'll get to that.

30
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,075
And and then M High,

31
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:12,505
It's such a pleasure to have you on. I I am I am so excited to get to have a a Disney master

32
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:23,644
join the show because you you are a legendary Dutch artist, and and and you are my first guess that has one of the fan graphics

33
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:25,081
Disney masters

34
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,338
stories release.

35
00:04:27,296 --> 00:04:30,151
So, you know, I'm sure that I'm sure that Dutch listeners

36
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:42,462
have a lot of your work. But if if Americans wanna pick up your work in addition to many of the issues, the Barks issues that you've been published and you you have this great fan graphics volume called

37
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,138
scandal on the App

38
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:57,357
Express. So forgive me for for rambling on tech can you tell us about your involvement with the comics and growing up as a Barks fan? If you if you've been into bark for a long time, Yes. Actually, I

39
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:02,209
I got to know Barks when I was six and I was completely

40
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:04,369
mesmerizing by the story

41
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:06,861
that there is if I start

42
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:11,564
talking about this subject because it's it's... It is so

43
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,118
imprinted in my

44
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:22,729
memories as a child, and it also... It was a hard time for me as a child child and and the the world of callbacks Barks was really

45
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:36,570
something I could step into and I I I I really thought Duck Bergen and every person there was real actually, and was dreaming about this. I was sure that this really existed. And,

46
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,130
yeah, Well, it's a long story. I

47
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,865
rediscovered it

48
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:43,905
way later and I I started

49
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:45,385
reading

50
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:46,425
everything

51
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:47,925
all the Barks

52
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:54,680
stories and it was... Yeah. I I just want it to be a comic artist.

53
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,380
And... Yeah. That's that's the thing.

54
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:05,540
That's that's what happened. I looked myself up for a year in my house in my apartment and I

55
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,175
because I I didn't

56
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:08,570
draw that much

57
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:12,396
in my younger years, and then I just practiced

58
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:13,725
practice prices

59
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:15,203
over and over.

60
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,401
Again, hands feeds,

61
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:33,959
beak, all all these things. And after a year, I send something to the dot magazine and they were... Yeah. They liked it and they wanted to... Let me try stuff. So I did. And then I remember the moment that I that I was rolling back from

62
00:06:34,934 --> 00:07:12,959
the the the building where where they... Where I was sort of accepted as a as an artist. And rolling back to the station on my roller blades, and I was just lying. So... Yeah. And there Al start and I. So still... I'm very passionate about Barks and the whole universe Barks. That's wonderful. And it must have been such a thrill to get to following Barks foot footsteps And and it's very apparent, right? Looking at your art that you are very inspired by the duct man. Seems like you and the other dutch artist really have, like, model what you do on a very specific era of of Barks

63
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:22,974
work. Right? Because you guys tends to like the stuff in the late kind of the late forties. Right? Is would... Is that what you would say? Yes. Maybe in terms of Barks style. But the

64
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:40,939
are a much broader part of course. Yeah. Mh. Right. The stories tend to be a little more contemporary temporary. Right? And and Bark did that. He he was riding modern stuff at the time. And you... I wouldn't say you guys have like hospitalized writing in that error or anything. Because a lot of them have very modern touch.

65
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:47,335
But it it's it's very clear to see the the inspiration that you've taken from Barks

66
00:07:48,053 --> 00:08:03,697
and and have some great work of your own. So I'm just I'm delighted to get to talk to you. I'm I'm delighted to hear all of your perspectives on the art and the writing and this great story. Oh, really quickly, now, how about you would... Have you... Do you have any earthquake experience?

67
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:04,676
Yeah?

68
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:06,271
No. Absolutely

69
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:09,754
not. Another guy. No. I've never been aware of

70
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,663
earthquake happening. I know that's

71
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,784
want to place somewhere in the netherlands in So nineteenth. Yeah. I really.

72
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:18,824
And myself.

73
00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:40,919
Yeah. Well, I didn't notice it and... Yeah. I think... Yeah. It's I would also I would love to roll roll around and, you know, launch myself from a hillside. So Yes. I would go for for that one. Alright. So far or three for three. And and I've I've gotta say, I think I'm gonna make it unanimous. Right? Because it's just

74
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,559
so much more

75
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:43,799
imaginative.

76
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:54,381
It's so much more appealing even though these guys are technically slamming themselves into these fillers and it looks pretty painful whereas the fermi are pushing, It's just not as it's not as iconic it.

77
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,356
One is more useful than the.

78
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:07,600
So very briefly I could go on for a long time, but I I grew up in California. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, so I've been in many many quick.

79
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:18,152
Including a pretty famous one Loma Pre one in nineteen eighty nine that that made made some international news And, you know, it's just part of our like,

80
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:31,579
education is learning how to how having earthquake drills constantly. So like, earthquakes were always in the background when I grew up and so this story seemed like such a natural thing to me to think about

81
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:35,895
to speculate on the cause of earthquakes. And

82
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:58,214
yeah curious about you guys because we Al at this story when we were very young and in my case. I don't remember something like that, but often you will read something in the economic and then think the world works like that because she just didn't... Actually learn about the real version or do you recall, like, how you thought or earthquakes were made or how if Barks? Well, I read the story points. Late.

83
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:01,354
And I think I already

84
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:06,046
knew what was happening in a real earthquakes, Not not really

85
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:10,572
thinking that it was of these guys. Not little men not right.

86
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:14,484
It's it's a great question though, En Because

87
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:22,959
kids Barks so, you know, that's that's the way that kids are. I know for my part, we got so much education we learned about earthquakes.

88
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,139
So much that, like, even even when I read this, I think I would been

89
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:44,091
seven or eight I'm thinking. I knew. Oh, that's not right? It's caused by fault lines and so on and so forth. I knew a lot about the science of it just because they hardest. What about Ut tim and Henri? I think I might have been Al gullible as the thing this was really.

90
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:47,794
Had been big imagination. Is a.

91
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:48,574
Yeah.

92
00:10:49,453 --> 00:11:07,989
This was probably more plausible to me because I could see it. They tried because of the drawings. But that's the thing. The eggs in this one are spectacular, and Barb does such an amazing bit of world building that it just it feels so plausible. Just feels right. Yeah. I you enrique. It's

93
00:11:08,446 --> 00:11:12,419
every other the story that he really manages to bring something completely

94
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:13,337
insane

95
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:17,980
it's unbelievable. You just buy it and also all the studio scientific

96
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:46,259
stuff he explains. Yeah. Yeah. With me... Now I... So I don't don't remember when I learned that stuff, but I always love outside of Comme. I didn't really like reading fiction and love reading non fiction books just learning about everything. So I also don't really remember them, and I didn't really know kind of about some earthquakes work. But yeah, upgrades, we're not a thing we deal with here really. Right. But but this is actually a really good tradition, you know, bark like concept here of creatures

97
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:52,141
underneath the ground. There's a long tradition of this in human history of different

98
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:57,784
cultures having this kind of like myth. I read a little article that said,

99
00:11:58,323 --> 00:12:20,404
it started out. Would you believe that giant snakes Ducktales, catfish fish, or spiders? Live underneath the ground, and it is their movements that create birth earthquakes. Maybe you wouldn't, but your ancestors did. So usually, there was this idea that there was something alive and large and restless down there. That might be causing beads. It's just such an animating concept.

100
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:22,119
But honestly, the real

101
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:24,272
explanation is also pretty wild.

102
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:27,239
Yeah. It's pretty crazy too that the whole

103
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:28,675
stuff.

104
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:30,271
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

105
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:39,953
Guys. Why don't I count talk a little bit about the background of the the story and its publications so that we can get into the real meat the content of it pretty quickly.

106
00:12:40,472 --> 00:12:53,702
Land beneath the ground was first publish in the the cover date was January of nineteen fifty six, and it was first printed uncle Scrooge number third team. This one has had a lot of printing.

107
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,718
It's worth saying that you guys this is a super famous Coral Barks story. This is arguably

108
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:10,480
one of his most famous ones. It's gotta be up there in the top five or so. Even if it's not like his highest rated story. It has such a big and invent concept,

109
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:22,744
you know, that that saw some wide release and the Ducktales up. So that, like, if you've heard about Carl Barks. Chances are really good you know about this story. As I've been doing the podcast and I have people sometimes

110
00:13:23,203 --> 00:14:25,057
message me about maybe being interested in joining it. This is the story that by far the most people have been interested in joining me to host. Like this, this is a this is a fan favorite. As far as the page length, that's where it gets a little bit murky. Right? Because this was had this had a little bit of a weird Genesis, a a little bit of a weird birth to get to publication. I've mentioned this before and it's not... Ultimately that interesting, but there was a period of time where Western Publishing figured out that they could get a better rate, a better mailing rate for subscribers. If they followed this weird post office rule that a a publication had to have two separate characters in it qualify. So Barks was made to, like, cut pages out of stories occasionally so that he could fit a second story usually about chi Gear in it. And as a result, this one started out at thirty two pages but for its first printing, it ended up having twenty seven pages

111
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:28,843
and then a number of panels and pages ended up being

112
00:14:29,554 --> 00:14:56,085
stored. And so I think the current length is something like twenty nine and a half pages or something like that. I'm I'm not too interested in getting, like, every little detail of that right you guys, but I think the important thing to know is that there's still a little bit of this that's technically missing. Barks made sure to pull out stuff that wouldn't affect the flow of the story too much. Hopefully. I... This is also one of the earliest Barks stories I read.

113
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:06,185
So I phone memories of it, but one of the pages there was the most iconic to me that I... That stuck out the the most. So I only found out I only found out just yesterday

114
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:15,760
that the page was missed... That's one of the pages I was missing and Al be early printing. So it's one that Barks actually decided to cut out himself that the it was less

115
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:16,840
important.

116
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:42,970
And then there's there's even one panel that he had used Al like a little bridging panel that now gets excluded from the publication because it doesn't really make sense with some of the stored art. Again, we might mention those when we get to it. I'm I'm not there's so much to this story that I I don't wanna dwell on kinda of that little inside based fall behind the scenes stuff. Alright. So I always

117
00:15:43,546 --> 00:15:46,038
enjoy checking in on some of the international

118
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,250
story Ducktales, you know, because these are so popular

119
00:15:49,630 --> 00:16:15,275
around the world. Here we are in the states and in Netherlands talking about it. So So we're... I think we should each take on and everyone who's willing should mention one of the titles from around the world. So I can't resist this to you guys. I've got I've got three people, three dutch artist from Netherlands here. I should be the one to do the dutch title because that's funny to me. You you guys are gonna either

120
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:17,515
praise me or or laugh

121
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,335
lia Al me.

122
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:20,967
I am gonna say this is

123
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:25,740
Ti land under the Ar. The land under the earth. Yeah. Yeah.

124
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:29,225
Yeah. It's not too bad. It sounded like something from.

125
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,485
Okay. Yeah. So let's let's hear from You now. You're gonna... You're gonna give us French.

126
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,777
Let me the by boom. I'm might translate to. It's it's sort of a...

127
00:16:44,194 --> 00:16:45,510
How do you say on automatically pay?

128
00:16:46,602 --> 00:16:59,966
It's... Yeah. So it is the cracks the do bada boom. Did produce that sounds by. I'm actually curious and is what the actual characters are called. So that is the character names. In French

129
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:01,622
clock bada boom.

130
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:06,843
Yeah. So they just named after the the something makes It is.

131
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,956
I... I think that's the only

132
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:13,240
one that uses the name of the terry and the Fermi. In the title

133
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:20,460
which got me curious about the terry and the fermi in in other languages. But but go ahead, Henri, what... Which one do you wanna do?

134
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:22,865
Let me see. Finish.

135
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,379
Yeah.

136
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:27,748
See oh. I'm sorry. My friends from finland.

137
00:17:30,254 --> 00:17:33,547
My or something like got which I have absolutely know. I

138
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:35,502
speak because spinach and

139
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:49,543
yeah I think that you guys... Most of the titles are a pretty direct translation of something like the land, the ground. And and that one that you just read Henri is the underground world. How about you tim, you wanna do one?

140
00:17:50,262 --> 00:17:52,780
I actually really like Brazil if you're down for that.

141
00:17:57,139 --> 00:18:00,128
Can you guess what that translates to? The makers of

142
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:05,960
Earthquakes. Yeah. The makers are the manufacturers. Yeah. Yeah. So that that's a lot of fun.

143
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:20,226
They're mostly straightforward, but but always interesting. Yeah. I've got I've got some other trivia and stuff you guys, but... But I can kind of integrate it as we do the story itself. You guys ready to plow into this? Yeah. Mh. Alright. So again

144
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:28,505
right. Oh, real really quickly. I should mention that the name of the creatures that the dutch are gonna encounter this.

145
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:39,455
It's a really fun ton. On on a latin term. The term Terra firm is like solid ground. So that's why these these characters are called the Terry and The fermi.

146
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:56,346
And I did look it up to see in other languages, but just in the interest of time, I'll bypass that. So boy, right away, this first page, you guys, the land beneath the ground, it is a stun of of an introductory paid. There is nothing

147
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,302
that

148
00:18:57,918 --> 00:19:02,295
significant or that stands out too much on the opening page, but it does such a

149
00:19:02,795 --> 00:19:34,442
spectacular job of setting up this story and intriguing the reader and really signaling what uncle Scrooge is about and what motivates him. Barb opens it up with the great narrator box that says Uncle screws just rock Al high above the clouds and dive deep beneath the seas, but never as he had a stranger adventure than that, which is about to default him, deep within the earth it cell and we encounter Scrooge basically in full bore worry mode. He's reading the paper about terrible,

150
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:46,078
quick thinking about other recent earthquakes, we see him pacing in his weary room, and and he is worried about the predictable thing that a quick might strike here Inducks

151
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:51,750
and destroy his money then. And boy you guys... It it is great.

152
00:19:52,444 --> 00:19:58,777
It is fantastic how the reader is being drawn into this story. It's got this

153
00:19:59,116 --> 00:19:59,616
beautiful.

154
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:03,590
He's using black has a sort of threatening

155
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:04,590
force

156
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,770
that... Well, it already Inducks

157
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:12,321
introduces you into his his dark

158
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:19,447
fears and it's so beautiful. It's... I think it's the most outstanding panel in the whole story actually.

159
00:20:19,826 --> 00:20:21,445
So you mean that fourth panel

160
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:27,448
Or you have that one as well. But it this first stage and already in the opening

161
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:28,365
splash

162
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:47,195
yeah. That's a great point. There's all this, like, menace. Looming over this representing screws is worried, and you're right, that that's splash panel, it's hard to argue with. What do you guys think? I also really liked the little boat. I have the third book for the left. I mean, it never stood out to me before, but it's like

163
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:48,630
one of the

164
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:49,840
areas of for me

165
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:56,297
Yeah It is. You guys I think it's a little... I think it represents like a it's it's a little morning.

166
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,242
Like Al boy morning.

167
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,000
Right. Like it it it's it represents him morning for the oil wells that have gone to put

168
00:21:04,536 --> 00:21:10,514
nice. Those ledger, but it does have that dual purpose of made sensing at the bow tide,

169
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,947
and then it also

170
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:18,072
serves the additional purpose of evo, you know, drilling

171
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:30,945
beneath the ground before we even know about. I I love... I mean, the the second panel course it Al concept at the february worry room areas but I in the fourth panel to how the the... There's this looming black sky

172
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:47,462
over the Money, but also the hands off sign being bigger than the actual title of the building is city funny. It is really funny. And the worry room always cracks me up and his little line in there only last week a quick in bo swallow to Castor oil factories.

173
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:51,875
That's how hilarious. And and you guys the fortune that he is

174
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:55,675
describing. This is one of the running gag, right, where he's always gonna

175
00:21:56,268 --> 00:22:09,039
label his fortune as a different value in my head growing up as a kid. This was the like official number of of his fortune for me. And I memorized this the kid So can you say memory?

176
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:14,890
I I can't anymore. No. But I'm gonna read it all out loud because this number makes me so happy.

177
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,310
He says five billion Qui

178
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,610
Up

179
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:21,583
and passive

180
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:27,296
fantastic trillion dollars is worth trying to say. So great. So

181
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,710
The next sequence is basically about Scrooge heading to

182
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,310
commission scientists.

183
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:39,333
To see what can be done to protect his fortune and when he encounters Donald on the way,

184
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:52,407
Donald points out that they can only make educated guesses so he suggests what screws is ultimately gonna do, which is to dig this spiraling tunnel beneath has been to inspect for worrying

185
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:54,042
weaknesses.

186
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:59,236
Yeah something I I left which accepts stalls very une uneducated

187
00:22:59,892 --> 00:23:01,467
opinion in here. This is like

188
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:12,604
dog comes to perform with an Id idea and all screws says okay. Yeah. I just buys it's from a nephew for some reason, but one the coincidence steps that donald is walking there.

189
00:23:13,462 --> 00:23:14,921
Yeah just buy it and

190
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:25,350
drives it. And we get the first... We get a mention of a crack which is gonna be a word that haunt Scrooge later on. So the next sequence, you know, it sees Scrooge

191
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:31,259
play out that plan. We this really cool cross section panel of

192
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:37,222
ex waiters digging that tunnel beneath his been. And and even though it's just like

193
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,100
laborers,

194
00:23:38,597 --> 00:23:58,905
Barks makes it a pretty exciting sequence. We see the form and weeks later we see the form and say we're two miles down mister Mc and have found nothing, but solid rock and, you know, Scrooge won't be stopped. He tells him to keep digging. And they get four miles down and still no sign of a fisher or hollow. And Tim, do you wanna tell us about what happens

195
00:23:59,403 --> 00:23:59,881
eventually.

196
00:24:00,638 --> 00:24:01,736
Suddenly one day

197
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,758
the men are all leaving the chef was wild. It's hurry. And

198
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:29,778
they come out in the fried because they hold through the top of a mammoth hole and they heard voices. A great moment. Right? Like this feels before you know what about rest of the story this feels so eerie. I'd I just love it. It sets... It sets this up so well, and then they referenced that hold that my be as big as the inside of the whole world. Yeah. We're is feels skeptical.

199
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:31,453
Yeah. Scrooge is always

200
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:39,762
skeptical. But but because these experts have been scared off, you know, the Inducks are gonna have to mount Al Expedition

201
00:24:40,338 --> 00:24:45,359
using a min. This is a great... This is gonna be a great Mine sequence. And

202
00:24:45,936 --> 00:24:59,252
so the Ducktales get all packed up and and prepped to go down there and donald comments that they've got everything but Al observer. And asks, who's gonna go down for you? And we get this funny little

203
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:18,465
exchange. Do you wanna tell us about it Henri about how he him into it? Yeah. He's here here Al I owe you for fifty cents that borrowed in nineteen fifty, and it down interested now amounts to five hundred. So if I'm not wrong, he he through this story in nineteen fifty ninety six five, I think so that's a pretty bad

204
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:31,665
yeah. And and this hasn't been too long again since there is a similar concept in secret of Atlanta. So I just like to imagine Screws with this, like, file full of Donald Io used to to cash. Also would be better borrowing

205
00:25:32,045 --> 00:25:33,145
anywhere else from

206
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,265
anyone out.

207
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:37,805
So, you know, Donald is rope into it.

208
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:45,130
I think this is one of those sequences that Barb had cut out for pacing because he thought it It not too important.

209
00:25:45,905 --> 00:25:59,620
And and he's gonna go down with sc. And as they get ready to go down, the Ducktales start to notice something odd around the excavation side. You wanna tell us about what they notice, now? Yeah. This...

210
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:08,658
Yeah. What is this? Rocks or weird bowls of we don't know why it is exactly, but they they... Especially with the the coloring, they

211
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,989
looks somewhat shiny

212
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,828
and

213
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:14,465
colorful flow as well by the way. But,

214
00:26:15,164 --> 00:26:15,664
obviously,

215
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:17,861
Scrooge is not

216
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,430
impressed. He says, I guess it's not important.

217
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:24,882
I didn't see them, but Barks.

218
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:26,540
Thing last one.

219
00:26:28,035 --> 00:26:28,155
Right.

220
00:26:28,928 --> 00:26:35,452
And and you guys this is one of the weird things about the story. Right? The rocks are always the quote rocks are always colored.

221
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:51,201
So colorful. And there's there definitely exists colorful rocks in nature. But they they really stand out. So this is a little bit of that comic book logic that I think we have to get past. Yeah. I was actually curious about but the caller speak because. I was wondering if

222
00:26:51,555 --> 00:27:01,187
Barks would have called them if they would be just gray. Mh. But I doing some faint studies, and he also make be colorful so... Yeah. I wondered I wondered about that myself.

223
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,340
About what he might have, you know, originally intended.

224
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,120
I think there's one

225
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:23,350
sketch he did that does have a colorful terry or firm if I remember right? So and he has a drawing that has a colorful one, but I don't I think he did it a lot later. So I don't know if he just accepted that, you know, the colors But I wish I could've have... I wish I could have read his mind and, you know,

226
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:38,969
confirmed whether he intended them to be all like gray and brown. And and when I grew up with one of the... And in the dutch one, I grew up with they were either purplish or orange, but it was also only the thirties... The there were one color and the furnace for.

227
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:40,027
Interesting.

228
00:27:40,364 --> 00:27:45,264
I mean, I think I think it's a big part of the appeal of this story. Frankly.

229
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:51,979
They just... They look so interesting. But it is definitely silly that the duct don't inspect these a little bit closer.

230
00:27:52,457 --> 00:27:52,957
Because

231
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,769
all all of a sudden,

232
00:27:55,228 --> 00:28:02,455
the my cart is going to wrench loose from the cable and Scrooge Donald gonna roll down that shaft

233
00:28:03,073 --> 00:28:07,262
that, you know, four mile deep, not long but deep shaft.

234
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:15,952
Because someone has pulled the cable pin. So this is pretty dramatic, pretty serious, and the kids have to also out

235
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:38,085
an expedition now to rest to them, and they set they set it for automatic release and the same thing happens to them. Some joker has pulled the same cable pen trip on the nephews as well. Yeah. Well, it's weird that they're they're talking about the joker because I was reading the dutch

236
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:42,725
translation, and they... There is was also some help lag or pricing.

237
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:49,328
But it's so weird because a joker, why would he why would a joker play with the Doctors

238
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:51,603
lives? Yeah. I don't know.

239
00:28:52,021 --> 00:29:05,746
That was for me to weird moments somehow. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think it fits with the ominous tone of the story that you are identifying at the beginning. Right? Because it is Like you said, this this likely would kill them. Yeah.

240
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,642
Wonder how long the chef must be incredibly long.

241
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,935
Yeah. Absolutely.

242
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:28,451
I did look up a little bit about, like, the the longest that people have drilled down into the earth and it is... There there's is a hole that was drilled not for people to, like actually travel down. But the longest, the deepest that people have gone is

243
00:29:29,402 --> 00:29:33,213
a little over twelve kilometers, which is about eight miles.

244
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:39,580
D... And no one has gone anything closer than that. About two miles is like a a mind

245
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,020
drill that a drilled mine. So anyway, the the next sequence

246
00:29:44,454 --> 00:29:45,554
is basically

247
00:29:46,012 --> 00:29:48,110
the Nephews racing down

248
00:29:49,008 --> 00:29:54,816
out of control, but but Dave thought had. Tim, do you wanna tell us about their preparation?

249
00:29:55,735 --> 00:29:56,634
Well they say...

250
00:29:57,533 --> 00:29:59,751
They're getting speed like a hard and

251
00:30:00,861 --> 00:30:12,790
another one of you said this time to play our little joke. Worst smart, we brought along poles to jam the wheels in case anything went wrong. And they call out to the invisible joker, like, put that in your invisible pipes is focus.

252
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:18,602
I like it. That's cute. Yeah. So they slow themselves down to the hole that the ex

253
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:23,511
clearly busted through when they saw this giant cavern.

254
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:25,666
There's this great ominous

255
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:33,185
shot where they... I say shot. But a panel where they kinda peer into the darkness and and dope. They're.

256
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:37,795
It is And what I love about

257
00:30:38,135 --> 00:30:38,635
that

258
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:42,410
speaking sequences is that the little dogs

259
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,090
well, one of the Ducktales holding

260
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,170
the others

261
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,184
by their tail. Yeah. And it's so sweet. And

262
00:30:50,522 --> 00:31:07,162
I don't know. I I love that little panel. Yeah. Shows that their care for each other and it's it's it's just beautiful. It is. Yeah. It's a nice touch and that there is so sync. Yeah. Yes. And I just love the neck... Panel on the next page. Yeah. Why don't you tell us

263
00:31:07,914 --> 00:31:09,293
Yes. Yeah. Just...

264
00:31:10,192 --> 00:31:18,491
Yeah words really it does so much with Al little one. He really makes years of black and on the next stage the panel see silhouette of the nephews

265
00:31:18,828 --> 00:31:32,937
with some of the camera around and surrounded by some of the light that they still have around, but it's really tiny on the battle. So they're really being swallowed up by black. They're looking... Even though it's a small panel and we're looking into this is black and you already to get the feeling of how massive

266
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,507
and trading the case underneath must.

267
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:45,485
Isn't that wonderful. What a great piece of perspective. And and we we feel like we're underground for most of the rest of this story it really does feel like that.

268
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:55,230
So the Nephews, you know, they call out as the first step for their uncles to see if they're all right And and all they here are some,

269
00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:07,328
which at least proves that it's got a bottom sides. Al they go to get some flares in the mining car, they discover that it's being pulled back up the track buy somebody,

270
00:32:07,705 --> 00:32:09,082
those invisible joker,

271
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:10,038
possibly.

272
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:19,235
And and, you know, there's no evidence of them of anyone except for more of those goofy round rocks, and just in that moment, the Nephews

273
00:32:19,535 --> 00:32:24,448
here some voices just like the digger her. You know nephews eventually

274
00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:26,544
ne the story for us.

275
00:32:26,984 --> 00:32:29,820
Especially when they're they say garden, how did they get her?

276
00:32:30,714 --> 00:32:32,812
Right. But in a very, like, natural

277
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:47,340
way. Yeah. How about it now, do you wanna tell us about what happens to the nephews as they're appearing into the cavern? Yes. Well, then you see this beautiful shot of you... These huge Well, these Barks are

278
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:54,968
in front of us and they're rolling a high speed towards the the small tiny and vulnerable

279
00:32:55,945 --> 00:32:56,445
nephews

280
00:32:56,783 --> 00:32:57,283
and

281
00:32:57,661 --> 00:32:59,398
it's... And then they

282
00:32:59,737 --> 00:33:00,237
sm

283
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:01,275
because

284
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:02,273
that's

285
00:33:03,424 --> 00:33:05,998
see written there as me

286
00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:07,633
into the darkness.

287
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:12,179
And in this darkness day, for the one of the nephews

288
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,861
feel like a Ducktales in a bowling.

289
00:33:16,756 --> 00:33:18,890
Imagine just saying that we're you're bigger one is.

290
00:33:19,784 --> 00:33:20,701
That was scary.

291
00:33:21,593 --> 00:33:22,093
Right.

292
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:24,807
It's a little silly they're They're na

293
00:33:25,384 --> 00:33:27,521
themselves as they follow along

294
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:35,037
that they talk about flying through space and then landing on a sla surface and going over

295
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,211
over some slick moss.

296
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:43,112
You guys it always bothered me in the printing that I have that the Terry and Fermi

297
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:47,620
that hit them don't match their colors. I always want them to be color coordinated.

298
00:33:48,380 --> 00:34:00,440
Mh. Oh, yeah. I see the in the in the new well which is yours is the old colors in the... We... We're looking at several of economics at the same time as the Right. Graphics one, which is the old colors that think

299
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:07,840
Does that color match them? Oh, it's a green blue and orange ish, but they do go much shift. Oh, okay. Well, that's good.

300
00:34:10,212 --> 00:34:39,994
Right. So Tim, do you wanna... Do you wanna tell us about what they see as they slide down? To the bottom of this ramp. Yeah. They they see, like the sun of the Matte March hair, and they they they common like it's really scene from us in one wonderland. You see these huge fillers of holding the surface of the earth and this is really awe inspiring world really when she creates there's all these little Barks lying near the three docks. Yeah. And then longer you look the more of them you see Yeah. Everywhere

301
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:56,755
in the distance, There's this tiny little thoughts and it's yeah. Make it it's it is an amazing panel. This is gotta be one of Barks most iconic panels this first view of what we're gonna learn is Terry Fermi. I I love it. I mean, as a kid, I was just

302
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:57,633
enchanted

303
00:34:58,171 --> 00:35:02,158
by this. And and so the the docks... The Nephews,

304
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:10,320
they kinda orient themselves and then they hear their uncles. Their voices coming from beyond a crooked pillar and

305
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:17,566
Henri, this is this is the scene that you really like. To right where they encounter or tell us about what they encounter. Yeah. Well, I mean...

306
00:35:17,984 --> 00:35:20,797
But I when I was Severino this was like the funniest thing to.

307
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:25,557
Yeah. So so they're Scrooge and Al there are in a mine

308
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:28,547
writing in in Al loop loop basically.

309
00:35:28,924 --> 00:35:36,172
And they say stop this loop and create before we get cor. Think it is your nice serious travel. You don't call this serious.

310
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:44,573
So they say we hit this work or like a run market that been looping at the loop here for forty minutes slowing that sounds pretty terrible.

311
00:35:45,432 --> 00:35:50,945
I figure about new increase. I love that comment of Scrooge this is noon on Thursday.

312
00:35:51,445 --> 00:36:18,526
Why don't she keep telling us about that sequence and how they stop Alright. So at the end of the page, just still going. So the nephews for tell amount and how to break just like david with using a panel of the side of cart however, Al they Scrooge although, something's wrong. I just fall they just fall straight down. It's golden and nephew saying you kidding are your bright Id Okay we know that you would stop the car top of the? It's it's a great such fun lipstick sequence.

313
00:36:19,165 --> 00:36:19,644
Definitely.

314
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:39,914
Yeah. It's a great comic be And and that was one of the another of the moments that was, like, stripped out. And I I I totally understand why. But it's also the mind code thing such Al almost overview overused stroke, but, of course, one only has to be the first line. Very read about my Barks. Also, probably, I think the year before, I read this I went to

315
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:47,440
for the first time And lost different amounts and so much when I was six years old, so of course, I right. Yeah. And the mine part

316
00:36:48,219 --> 00:37:01,225
is pretty iconic. I gotta think that some of that must have come from this story. So you guys this next sequence is pretty packed. Right? This is gonna be our introduction to the to the Den of Terry Fermi.

317
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:09,456
They kind of... They take some time to marvel at this huge tavern. Donald is boggling Al how thick the

318
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:15,270
the pillars are and screws, you know, comments, they'd better be. They're all that's holding up my money bin.

319
00:37:16,045 --> 00:37:23,145
Donald Ponder that there must be some some kind of creatures living down here. And the Nephews point out that they've heard their voices

320
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:26,830
but they still think that it's gotta be these invisible people.

321
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:54,045
As they inspect the land, they they discover more, they see these little hats. These very smooth and worn paths, and they ponder what sort of creatures have made them because they haven't left any kind of a footprint And then we... The reader gets the surprise of... Yes it's not too much of a surprise. Right? Because, like, the... Barks has been signaling. Pretty loudly that these rocks are important

322
00:37:54,585 --> 00:37:55,805
Huey, have favorite

323
00:37:56,384 --> 00:37:59,005
rocks and boat letters about eighty five times

324
00:37:59,384 --> 00:37:59,505
Right.

325
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:12,251
Right. But it's still... It's such a delight to see it plays Al to see it play out. Because we see these word balloons come from the rocks. Saying, they think we should make tracks we

326
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:13,089
track

327
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:16,220
what with? And let's see. Who who have I not

328
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:22,152
thrown it to in a little while. Tell me about screws and encounter with the firm.

329
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:24,091
Well, a screws

330
00:38:24,884 --> 00:38:32,315
walks over to the bunch of the the Barks and on the rocks, I should say. And then if you still say, we think it's a invisible man.

331
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:39,382
Won't find anything. But screws says maybe not, but I'm getting suspicious of these rocks. And this rock is wearing a neck time

332
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,614
this is especially Yes.

333
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:42,611
Yeah.

334
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:51,980
Right. He just he rolls it over a little bit and Now we see it all bald up. And and

335
00:38:52,397 --> 00:39:03,197
I I love screws line. You guys as he like wrench cane inside the neck tie tells him get up there and give an account of yourself, you ball up hu

336
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:13,312
and now, you wanna tell us how the creature greet him? Yes. He says howdy partner. Welcome to Terry for me. And he's very...

337
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:14,790
Yeah. He's

338
00:39:15,505 --> 00:39:17,965
really inviting screws there. Is...

339
00:39:18,545 --> 00:39:23,777
Yeah. Yeah. These these baldwin up bugs this despite being very secretive.

340
00:39:24,554 --> 00:39:28,367
Once they Al themselves, they're very friendly. We were

341
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:37,873
there adorable. They have these, like big sn that kind of are like duck bills, but not quite

342
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:44,759
They have no feet. They're just balls at the bottom they're kinda shaped like a good or a base. And

343
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:58,045
it's so funny to see them all emerging once once the secret is out. And and when Scrooge asks what sort of creature are you? He says fermi. Shu partner, you sure ain't been around.

344
00:39:59,217 --> 00:39:59,717
So

345
00:40:00,095 --> 00:40:03,745
you guys this really kinda reminds me of, like, playing off.

346
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:07,515
Right? Where we have this like, secretive race of funny,

347
00:40:07,975 --> 00:40:21,232
not so threatening weird creatures that have their, like, kind of odd lingo and and speak acts scented English. Yeah. And I... By the way, I love the one on the left the squishy the squishy on.

348
00:40:21,968 --> 00:40:41,159
Shows the motion too of I I just kinda like, Oh, yeah. Fully brown software, but is the sender cute. Barks must had a blast drawing these guys. You guys are all artists here. What do you think of the the character design on these these creatures. Yeah they're there... Yeah. They're so nice to to look at and

349
00:40:41,576 --> 00:40:43,250
yeah. Super we're funny and cute.

350
00:40:43,985 --> 00:41:06,784
Super cute. And it's a simple. So you guys, at this point, the story is really picking up and we're starting to learn a lot about terry For. And I'm I'm gonna rattle off a couple of things that way you learn. Right? We... They're they're pretty important. They give a little bit of color to this It's it's always a shame to me that we don't get more because this is such a fascinating little

351
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:11,666
civilization that Barks creates but but we learned that the Severino extends

352
00:41:12,045 --> 00:41:13,504
all around the world,

353
00:41:13,842 --> 00:41:18,466
we learned that the way Barks app gives us a justification for them

354
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:23,167
speaking English by saying that they they pick up radio waves

355
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,531
through, like, j germanium or and you place this like cookie little

356
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:34,055
very funny commercial jingle, which is why they all look talk like, nineteen fifties movie cowboys.

357
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:39,095
I like to imagine that maybe the ones under Latin America talk like Tele o.

358
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:39,990
And.

359
00:41:42,045 --> 00:41:43,582
We we eventually

360
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:52,345
learn, and it's... And it's very funny the moment we learn. We we discover Henri why don't you tell us about what's

361
00:41:52,725 --> 00:41:53,945
what the purpose...

362
00:41:54,365 --> 00:41:58,325
The meaning of life is for being a terry Scrooge

363
00:41:58,365 --> 00:41:58,725
ass?

364
00:41:59,739 --> 00:42:15,849
You know, what do you do? What does your work? Are you minors or farmers or what? We don't work. We just have a game that we played. Every and every thirty to devote his whole life to getting a shape for game. Forget sake what you do in this game? We have to say it altogether, and I guess We may

365
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:18,882
week what

366
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,231
what a great panel. Is so funny you guys seeing that

367
00:42:23,545 --> 00:42:24,244
see uncle

368
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:31,415
collapse like that. Go ahead. Keep telling us about the demonstration En Rico. Also these they're pretty perfect.

369
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:51,695
See, this is how we do. Many millions of us for me squeezed into the karim beneath the press like this, and they... I'll press to together no Barks and place snap ups snap off of giant piece rock. Lift it up like this. It's a very good show for Al says. But I'm afraid Scrooge has missed that. He's painted better way one of my things.

370
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:59,750
That that... All of the dialogue on the... This couple of pages so snappy And I like... I like the moment

371
00:43:00,088 --> 00:43:23,136
when the nephews talk about how they'll tell grandma all about that place this place when we get home, then they kinda shutter if we get home. Yeah. That only takes a dark turn. Yeah. Yes. Right. And and these the... It's worth saying these guys are not managed thing at all. They're just... They're these weird goof balls. I. But I mean so are another ground their cart is gone.

372
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:44,130
Do you guys think about the fact that every terri and every fermi spends his whole life? They're they're all male. They're all quoted is a extremely new. Not. Yeah. No really follow. I think if if we would've written the comment nowadays, you would have just used day just similar day because I think they're supposed to be kind of gender. But, I mean, traditionally,

373
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:50,525
back in the day... I need still two wings. If the default is just meals. I guess supposed to be.

374
00:43:50,925 --> 00:43:51,425
You

375
00:43:51,885 --> 00:43:55,625
you could ask yourself how they reproduce and

376
00:43:56,299 --> 00:44:01,906
yeah. Without any females, we you could. Yeah. We just probably smash their together.

377
00:44:03,761 --> 00:44:21,709
Might. Well that's with a lot of these these economics. Like, that's the thing of Al these characters. So, like, of course, I'm was a little girl reading this, but they're all basically again on this but because the default mail. They're all representatives as me what I think. If I would read write this today, I would just use in English. That's a nice thing. You can just use the word

378
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:40,590
Right. Which which just covers any any random gender I know and you just say they. When it dutch it we really work. So... Right. I and I think you're right. There is that sort of male default from this sarah, but but these guys are more aggressively male than most of the like creatures because they're wearing like the little sign.

379
00:44:41,384 --> 00:44:44,785
The four in hand versus bow ties is mail a tire.

380
00:44:45,464 --> 00:44:47,939
Yeah. And they're they're all, like this competitive

381
00:44:48,398 --> 00:45:02,624
strength and vi. It is a very male coded thing. I... Yeah. I'm I I I don't even think Barks thought about it. It's just it's basically just the the default especially in the fifties. So meeting it as a kid. I I really didn't think about it. Yeah. Mean, neither.

382
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:25,519
They just need, like, tender to me. But I mean, you just right mail. But... I mean, I also... I'd also notice it now when I draw a character, I have a character that doesn't look specifically female so people just assume it's the huge mail. But that's just because it's it's you're that's how traditionally the the default is in especially old going so that's how I learned completely because I read this.

383
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:35,288
So and, you know, Barks sets up this, like, so society pretty pretty well. Like, we we learn a lot about it considering how few pages were actually

384
00:45:35,747 --> 00:45:48,902
down there. But I I like how he teaches us in that demonstration about the fur kinda show off And then in the next sequence, we're gonna also see the terry but varies in a little bit keep it interesting.

385
00:45:49,837 --> 00:46:11,364
He shows us this little, like, school of terry learning about how to how to roll the themselves into the pillars. And I've gotta say are we all in agreement that the way the Terry make their earthquakes by smashing, rolling and then smashing into the pill pillars It's just much much more engaging. Much more interesting. Right? Definitely.

386
00:46:11,844 --> 00:46:13,359
Just don't tell the furnace

387
00:46:14,136 --> 00:46:19,777
Right. It's officially much more impressive fun. Right. Yes. I mean, I like that little

388
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:26,609
contrast, how there's the two kinds of these goof balls. But... Yeah. So the docs watch a...

389
00:46:27,107 --> 00:46:35,923
They watch this school in action, and they see the the little tiny Terry crying when the news when the news radio

390
00:46:36,342 --> 00:46:36,842
broadcast

391
00:46:37,181 --> 00:46:41,409
talks about Al slight quick. Just jolt a small section

392
00:46:41,947 --> 00:46:50,169
of Duck. No. It's the the normal various and there's for were kicking enough yet. I he gets crying baby.

393
00:46:51,509 --> 00:47:00,300
Oh, yeah. Yeah. It... It's alright. They're adorable. Who wants to talk about the Bow ties and four in enhanced sequence. It's such a... It's such a bonkers

394
00:47:00,999 --> 00:47:01,499
weird

395
00:47:01,918 --> 00:47:08,749
detail and it's so funny. It it's delayed. Hold me. Now, do you wanna tell us? Yeah. What's what shall I say?

396
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:10,749
It's such a tiny...

397
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:14,284
Yeah. Difference between the two. It's almost

398
00:47:14,784 --> 00:47:15,284
ridiculous.

399
00:47:15,862 --> 00:47:19,039
So how do your guys know terry from Fermi,

400
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:20,678
but that's easy?

401
00:47:21,176 --> 00:47:25,723
We terry wear bow ties. And ref where for enhance.

402
00:47:26,379 --> 00:47:31,783
Am I weird for finding this so funny you guys... No. I'm pretty sure. That's normal. Yes

403
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:35,389
speak concept. And I

404
00:47:36,326 --> 00:47:38,901
gets ridiculous and that's why it's memorable

405
00:47:39,758 --> 00:47:49,172
it is. It's incredibly memorable. I love that this is the important fact that the the kids want to write in for their your wood guide puppy. Yes

406
00:47:50,244 --> 00:47:56,304
So you guys the next sequences where it starts to get serious. Right? The do have had some time to.

407
00:47:57,244 --> 00:48:14,488
We feel like they're just kind of processing their off right now. But the narrator Barks tells us that they're soon gonna find cause for real worry Tim, do you wanna give us kind of an overview about what is this event that's about top Well, which is the

408
00:48:15,438 --> 00:48:17,215
rom in the distance and

409
00:48:17,634 --> 00:48:20,808
Barks remarks but it sounds like a million bowling Barks.

410
00:48:20,947 --> 00:48:21,966
And one of the

411
00:48:22,424 --> 00:48:23,084
and front

412
00:48:23,422 --> 00:48:25,614
says, it is a million Barks. They

413
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:31,465
they've come rolling from both our corners of the earth to try for the trophy and Scrooge

414
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:37,654
it turns around the trophy trophy. This this something I should be I should know about. And

415
00:48:38,193 --> 00:48:41,450
well, the trophy is the the symbol of the earthquake championship.

416
00:48:42,442 --> 00:48:50,236
One of the terry says. Come on, will show it to you. And so it's actually this is like this story how they have these these competitions

417
00:48:51,027 --> 00:48:58,550
for earthquake and making earthquakes in in the past. And, yeah, The... They have this trophy for it. And the last time

418
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:09,107
was a few years ago and they lifted the floor of the wearing c seven feet. I I love how the fermi is bragging about the devastation. Of the earthquake

419
00:49:10,003 --> 00:49:14,332
and Scrooge just just glaring at him never nevermind the gory details.

420
00:49:15,404 --> 00:49:20,218
It cracks me up the way he's like, pointing up and spinning his fermi finger

421
00:49:20,597 --> 00:49:32,140
talking about how it rolled up a tidal wave that flooded half the basement in Pa Pa. I love all these little geographic details that Barks is bringing up throughout the story too. I also like how

422
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:32,954
screws

423
00:49:33,373 --> 00:49:38,818
in this last panel of the that other page, how he's already sensing

424
00:49:39,155 --> 00:49:42,766
but he's it's about a trophy, but he already senses

425
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:44,378
that there is something

426
00:49:44,757 --> 00:49:48,772
really wrong about that. Yeah. Got this, you know, our normal

427
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:49,611
almost

428
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:54,160
ability to know when there's trouble add.

429
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:55,538
Good worrying.

430
00:49:55,917 --> 00:50:14,954
Yeah. Yeah. This whole... This whole story is about him worrying and being paranoid, and now he's this detail is, like, flashing to him. Henry Enrique, do you wanna tell us about how they got that that this trophy. Let's see. It tunnel down for a crack that the terry opened up in greece in the years here crazy.

431
00:50:15,669 --> 00:50:45,450
Scrooge once again. Thanks. And something I... What I really like here in the in also in the next few pages, basically, I mean Barks is running a lot of detail, but it's only so much he can do so he really uses the dialogue and and the dialogue Barks too to really give you the the size... An idea of the size So... Because they keep mentioning how millions of them are coming in every few minutes and our millions come from and these wet land and the great hollow of so many soon see for hours and hours. Right.

432
00:50:46,607 --> 00:50:46,727
Yeah

433
00:50:48,084 --> 00:50:51,996
Al feels like faint too now. As an nephew will looks to today annoyed.

434
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:53,608
Right. Yeah. You're right.

435
00:50:54,687 --> 00:50:55,187
It.

436
00:50:56,125 --> 00:51:00,300
He does a great job of making this feel like really epic.

437
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:15,831
Feels I mean, we got the world cup just starting as of recording this. It did feels like the world cup plus or or times ten. Yeah. They think we look really closely at the... When all the there firm come in. They speak different languages

438
00:51:16,408 --> 00:51:28,074
done. Right. Right. He uses is kinda little gibberish Scrooge to represent languages from from around the world. I love that it just takes the mention now of a crack for screws to just faint.

439
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:29,269
Completely.

440
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:36,244
All love our in the panel august where they're all rolling in that they're... They say they're stacking themselves ninety deep at the double

441
00:51:36,903 --> 00:51:41,238
you could just barely see it under the dialogue box that there's this whole gigantic wall.

442
00:51:41,696 --> 00:51:41,776
Yeah.

443
00:51:42,895 --> 00:51:43,289
Service

444
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:48,932
way it's colored in some of the comments you can barely see that it's that it's secured. That it's... Yeah. Exactly.

445
00:51:49,411 --> 00:52:02,487
So, you know, and we learn the specifics of this year's event is that they're going to strike at the the giant pillar that is the main support for Duck. Right? So so Scrooge is like utter paranoia

446
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:13,014
his worry. It is... It has a reason behind it. You know, whether he was justified and having these paranoid fears or not, for the sake of storytelling telling, it

447
00:52:13,314 --> 00:52:32,629
it was meredith. So so at this point in the story, you know, the Inducks really, like, they have to decide what are they gonna do? And Donald is all for getting out of there that they've got to save themselves. You know, so he whispers to the Inducks. And we do have one... I guess it's firm. Right? Because that looks like a four hand.

448
00:52:33,429 --> 00:53:10,936
Fern over here them talking about, you know, getting up to the surface. And warning people to flee. But the firm don't like react the way, you know, we would expect them to because this one is saying that because of the moss slide that the Inducks came down on, it's too slick for them to get back up without any help. So, you know, they've basically got time to bargain with the Inducks for their silence. So it kinda like diffuse is some of the tension of of meeting Barks doesn't need the fermi to be a threat yet. Right? That's pretty important. He needs the dust to kinda be able to have the run of it.

449
00:53:11,353 --> 00:53:13,824
But but it... The threat still kind of lu.

450
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:18,493
And I like that he's he's thinking about this. He's trying to keep it sensible.

451
00:53:18,872 --> 00:53:21,784
And love little detail on this page where that

452
00:53:22,164 --> 00:53:22,864
the nephew

453
00:53:23,164 --> 00:53:29,536
is whispering and Al us whispering with Scrooge doesn't Barks the whisper, which is why he's being overheard. Right.

454
00:53:30,094 --> 00:53:49,546
Right. And and that's part of why the fermi is not worried because he here Scrooge saying no one would believe us. If we told them about this insurance. Yeah. So so that's always it's interesting with me with Call how some... So I'm saying it's risk whispering what you see is that the speech bubble instead of

455
00:53:50,004 --> 00:53:58,034
having a a a normal line that has a dotted line and somehow you know that it's screen. Yeah. Instantly. It's it's the great comics

456
00:53:59,294 --> 00:54:03,514
toolbox the you guys are... I'm sure all familiar with. Absolutely.

457
00:54:04,094 --> 00:54:04,174
Right.

458
00:54:05,029 --> 00:54:13,769
So Scrooge kinda steps on the Barks a little bit. He's like, no. You know, I've got a better idea. And, of course, he's motivated by wanting to save his money.

459
00:54:14,443 --> 00:54:17,800
He decides that he wants to appeal to their quote,

460
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:20,018
sporting fancy.

461
00:54:21,236 --> 00:54:23,015
This is a really fun sequence.

462
00:54:23,529 --> 00:54:32,829
You guys it's really funny, but I might... So so basically, in short, the gist of it is that Scrooge convince is donald that he should challenge

463
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:34,122
the champion

464
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,317
roller to a bumping

465
00:54:37,095 --> 00:54:41,565
contest to to see if they will call off the earthquake.

466
00:54:42,419 --> 00:54:48,039
And we get this great build up where Donald stands across from the champion roller. And

467
00:54:48,699 --> 00:54:53,803
and they goes exactly as well for Donald as you would expect. He gets catapult

468
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,835
as the nephew... As one of the nephews who's mentioned

469
00:54:57,348 --> 00:55:00,845
halfway in China, which is where he has to swim back

470
00:55:01,344 --> 00:55:05,160
from this big lake gru Al the way. Or donald

471
00:55:05,913 --> 00:55:08,326
But you you you you say he's

472
00:55:08,663 --> 00:55:15,674
he's he's convincing donald. But the way he's is convincing Donald is Well, basically struggling.

473
00:55:17,205 --> 00:55:21,012
It's dragging him to the to the guy and forcing

474
00:55:21,683 --> 00:55:27,012
to to do something donald really doesn't feel like Dude really does.

475
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:35,032
Yeah. It's a very funny. It's james. It's so funny. Seeing donald with the Scrooge cain dang yeah.

476
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:37,549
No. No. No.

477
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:40,099
I love the double actually try.

478
00:55:40,476 --> 00:55:41,415
Yeah. I.

479
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:49,969
I I guess there there is, like, maybe a small moment where you think maybe he's got this because he rolls up and. Been.

480
00:55:50,706 --> 00:55:52,324
Then no. It's it's donald

481
00:55:52,861 --> 00:55:53,361
thing.

482
00:55:54,832 --> 00:55:59,482
And and then as Donald is gru and swimming the whole way back

483
00:56:00,379 --> 00:56:06,325
shares his backup plan, which is to just swipe the con found trophy so they have nothing to

484
00:56:06,943 --> 00:56:17,128
nothing to compete for And I love that one of the nephews is just like I didn't you go with that in the first place instead making him swim halfway back from China.

485
00:56:17,546 --> 00:56:19,086
For donald peppers

486
00:56:20,064 --> 00:56:22,859
be that he came off pretty good my pretty well

487
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:23,659
considering.

488
00:56:23,959 --> 00:56:27,558
Yeah. Tim, do you wanna tell us about how the Ducktales

489
00:56:27,479 --> 00:56:29,338
launch into this next

490
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:31,671
attempt to forest Al games.

491
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:32,948
Well, donald,

492
00:56:33,764 --> 00:56:34,743
again it says,

493
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,708
he wants the appeal is sporting fancy. So

494
00:56:39,165 --> 00:56:40,303
he he begins

495
00:56:41,558 --> 00:56:42,935
challenging one of the

496
00:56:43,472 --> 00:56:45,288
one of the fur. And

497
00:56:45,626 --> 00:57:05,063
I mad at you mouse eating bold bearings. Champion terry just smack me two miles, but the for doesn't lift the can bug me off this rock. And the the the firm is for me, it takes a challenge. And he says, also the firm is our lift there's not sm. But I can roll hard enough to flatten the likes of you. And

498
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:09,471
as he rolls the towards, Donald, He says, happy landing busted.

499
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:18,719
But then that that'll just... He jumps up in the nick time and he wins Yeah. I like that sequence a lot. It's neat seeing donald

500
00:57:19,299 --> 00:57:27,247
turned the tables after he's just gotten, you know, smack around I really like is insult as well. The the Moss eating bolt.

501
00:57:27,905 --> 00:57:35,681
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I wonder if that is like, a a real detail or just an insult right? Because we don't learn a lot about these

502
00:57:36,176 --> 00:57:40,142
these creatures. Maybe that's what they need it's not know either.

503
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:44,660
And this doesn't thought that they couldn't get any more wacky.

504
00:57:46,032 --> 00:57:48,166
Do you wanna tell us about messages.

505
00:57:48,679 --> 00:58:03,194
This this sequence is great. And. You wanna tell us about the tel sequence as as well as that fermi rolls clear over into a third valley Yeah. So donald is only important is successful with Terry for and this way of sending messages

506
00:58:03,534 --> 00:58:04,834
and to defer me,

507
00:58:06,268 --> 00:58:14,465
He says, I've sugar clicks glimpse, those that's were fixing to sweat the trophy. A tell and alarm two to have partners. They

508
00:58:14,802 --> 00:58:15,821
inflate himself

509
00:58:16,174 --> 00:58:21,674
to a giant ball. And the message is have earlier, and the story that they're rubbery also

510
00:58:22,134 --> 00:58:22,794
the seems.

511
00:58:23,094 --> 00:58:25,809
And it just inflate himself and uses cell as a massive

512
00:58:26,267 --> 00:58:26,767
drum.

513
00:58:28,418 --> 00:58:29,494
This is so silly.

514
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:36,754
It. So was a real specific message It's like... Yeah. Love it just goes like, bamboo boom

515
00:58:37,254 --> 00:58:46,799
a message the Barks. That's it's still the trophy and they're racing bullshit. Yeah. This this part always cracks me up it it's very funny.

516
00:58:47,137 --> 00:59:09,937
It's very silly. If it had come earlier in the story, it might have been too silly. But at this point, we know that these creatures are just profoundly ridiculous. Do you guys remember another an earlier Barks story where he had a character do this? Not to put you guys on the spot, but what this swamp? So? No. Wait. Yep. It's it's mystery of the swamp where the the measles.

517
00:59:10,434 --> 00:59:11,133
Very the.

518
00:59:12,308 --> 00:59:18,667
He he doesn't exactly do the same thing, but but he's like a he's a swell. Right. Right.

519
00:59:19,466 --> 00:59:20,565
Dutch name. So

520
00:59:21,223 --> 00:59:26,374
I think over a lot of these three, I'm I'm now I'm curious that Al have to look up what I.

521
00:59:27,274 --> 00:59:29,614
What is it diesel and and dutch? I?

522
00:59:30,074 --> 00:59:40,845
So this next sequence is basically the pursuit. Sequence. Right? We we get to the part where the Ducktales are at that moss slide area. And

523
00:59:41,262 --> 00:59:45,525
just like you know, just like they figured, the Inducks can't easily

524
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:52,004
get up this Moss Hill. So this is gonna be one of the big problems that they have to pass near the end.

525
00:59:52,936 --> 01:00:02,130
I guess we get a couple of panels that were cut here. We'll have to opt include these when I shared it on Facebook, but he just excise the a little bit of this

526
01:00:02,643 --> 01:00:05,740
escape sequence out. Yeah. Love how the next sequence...

527
01:00:06,399 --> 01:00:12,466
Because they're being... They're being chased and they have to... The the nephews are gonna look in there in their guide book for a.

528
01:00:13,163 --> 01:00:30,342
So it's both... I love it it's both really tense and really silly. Mh. These These guide book sequences are always so funny to to have Barks like take them through the... Right where where they're like, look in the chapter on vegetable forms No. There'd be an instructions for grasping

529
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:32,017
slick object objects.

530
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:36,682
And there's a whole page on catching greased pigs,

531
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,093
but to

532
01:00:40,265 --> 01:00:42,042
Now do you wanna tell us what they

533
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:43,735
eventually planned on?

534
01:00:44,373 --> 01:00:47,479
Yes. Because then, finally, they they find

535
01:00:48,336 --> 01:00:53,259
under the, yeah. On the title or, yeah, the chapter the desperate

536
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:54,375
dilemma,

537
01:00:54,911 --> 01:01:05,085
it says when you can't climb over an obstacle go under it And so they decide to do, donald lifts up as part of the moss

538
01:01:05,478 --> 01:01:05,978
slightly

539
01:01:06,836 --> 01:01:07,336
slippery

540
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:15,434
slow thing. I'll be dug and this moss lifts up like a blanket and the ground beneath is rough revel.

541
01:01:15,914 --> 01:01:16,574
You know.

542
01:01:17,194 --> 01:01:29,189
Like a perfect square it gets listed. Yeah Right. We can crawl up the slide under the mouse, like mole. Come on. And there they go over the most and they managed to... Yeah. To

543
01:01:29,689 --> 01:01:30,949
scroll the

544
01:01:31,409 --> 01:01:33,049
the, yeah, the goof bulls.

545
01:01:33,863 --> 01:01:36,959
Yes. That's a good thing. That is a good name for them.

546
01:01:37,618 --> 01:01:57,084
But Scrooge starts to lag behind You wanna tell us why Henri? Well, he lives find well my mole don't, I high silk cats and he makes the... We we don't know it yet, but the beautiful... Or is it a dreadful mistake is good thing. He throws away is hat down down towards the case.

547
01:01:57,899 --> 01:02:01,192
So you can speed it. Yeah. As a reader, I always

548
01:02:02,049 --> 01:02:05,302
always feel a little conflicted when I see something

549
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:12,177
iconic. About a character being given up. Right? Even if Barks is just gonna, like etch sketch this

550
01:02:12,634 --> 01:02:15,487
out the next issue, I'm like, no. It's.

551
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:18,934
The worst it's the card. I everyone possible.

552
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:24,323
With the well with Donald head, I feel like he has a eight hundred of the consumer.

553
01:02:25,914 --> 01:02:29,894
Right. But Scrooge is clearly more more more special.

554
01:02:30,314 --> 01:02:42,402
And I like the sequence a lot. I can I can really imagine this having like a sterling score and being very exciting because we've got, like, millions of fe being pushed up behind

555
01:02:42,794 --> 01:02:54,337
or an army affirm being pushed up to boost them behind as the Inducks crawl up, and the fermi are giving these these goof balls are sports fans basically? Right? They're like

556
01:02:54,795 --> 01:02:58,807
I don't know. They're almost soccer hoo or something. Yeah. This is something gets scary.

557
01:02:59,744 --> 01:03:02,934
Right. And then they're doing this goofy year.

558
01:03:03,753 --> 01:03:08,168
One more shu Raw raw, and we'll roll into the shaft

559
01:03:08,787 --> 01:03:09,287
charge

560
01:03:09,745 --> 01:03:13,539
it's a very classic you know, like an archaic sounding cheer

561
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:21,850
and the docks parallel it with a clever bit of riding where it's one more inch will be over the top and and the nephew you say one more inch.

562
01:03:24,084 --> 01:03:26,060
I like. At least that's how I imagine

563
01:03:26,398 --> 01:03:42,134
the nation going. And And finally, the Ducktales make it, and and they seem to be free because once they're in the shaft, they can run up hill faster than the Tires and f can roll up. So it's it's a nice moment where we breathe for a little bit

564
01:03:42,634 --> 01:03:43,134
before

565
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:49,820
before we flash back to the teri and front any comments you guys. Yeah. Well, it's it's especially beautiful.

566
01:03:50,597 --> 01:03:53,769
Well, the the way these these these creatures are being...

567
01:03:54,186 --> 01:03:56,281
Yeah. How they're drawn with their

568
01:03:57,474 --> 01:03:59,174
disappointment, at this disappointment

569
01:03:59,514 --> 01:04:01,334
on their faces it's just.

570
01:04:01,914 --> 01:04:02,414
It's

571
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,229
these these little mouse

572
01:04:04,568 --> 01:04:05,786
and these eyes...

573
01:04:06,483 --> 01:04:13,423
Does bust is the master of with the, you know, expressions of whatever kind of

574
01:04:13,762 --> 01:04:16,059
emotions and this is brilliant.

575
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:26,750
It definitely is. Because all they are is balls with faces basically, and he's making them so expressive. Yes. It's so funny.

576
01:04:27,881 --> 01:04:30,335
Now we're onto to one of the other most memorable

577
01:04:30,751 --> 01:04:31,230
pages.

578
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:43,442
I I would feel the one... The other one that's stuck out in my memory really a lot but so great. Yeah. I'm sure that this page lands in a lot of people's memories. I why introduce it and then you can tell us about Henri.

579
01:04:45,013 --> 01:04:45,513
Basically,

580
01:04:45,972 --> 01:04:51,359
you know, the the... They they rally a little bit. The carries and fermi, and they decide that now they have

581
01:04:52,177 --> 01:04:53,196
like a meaningful

582
01:04:53,733 --> 01:05:05,274
reason to make an earthquake because they've gotta try and shake the Inducks out of the shop So they're going to get all they're gonna work together to create the biggest

583
01:05:06,094 --> 01:05:15,614
earthquake. In history. Are you guys the details of this earthquake are so great. You wanna do you wanna tell us some of Henri? Yeah. First of all to here is big where just lock

584
01:05:16,671 --> 01:05:17,610
individual phase

585
01:05:18,507 --> 01:05:19,206
take characters.

586
01:05:19,664 --> 01:05:33,520
U. Yeah. The the is new and and the firm is he to stock has never had it hooked up. So let's see where on the left, we have a three upside down. And we have a trim where one half is upside down half.

587
01:05:33,858 --> 01:05:39,924
We have some fancy hotel. The the the guy the hotel was holding up for two life.

588
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:46,870
And we have some buildings that are just playing for a year. And an actual ship on top of the bridge.

589
01:05:47,943 --> 01:05:48,303
Saturday.

590
01:05:50,021 --> 01:05:51,619
Well, I guess it's the best. Yeah.

591
01:05:52,818 --> 01:05:53,518
It's easy.

592
01:05:54,497 --> 01:05:56,774
Great panel of this guy in above. Yeah.

593
01:05:57,589 --> 01:06:12,572
And I just want I love the dialogue the cards with it too. So it's hard to say which is the worst the bouncing. And you see this this guy with stolen in the water except the water and him and sober or flying not do both the bathtub or the rake,

594
01:06:12,931 --> 01:06:14,666
which is get super.

595
01:06:15,339 --> 01:06:16,119
Very terrible.

596
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:18,119
Dreadful.

597
01:06:19,499 --> 01:06:23,439
But... Yeah. And it's so nice because the the water is still

598
01:06:23,794 --> 01:06:26,494
you know, it's it's it still has the form of the bathtub.

599
01:06:26,994 --> 01:06:31,974
Yeah. So it's... It must have been a such a crazy balance

600
01:06:32,474 --> 01:06:36,143
that that there was not even time for waves

601
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,220
to,

602
01:06:38,476 --> 01:06:40,292
you know, to come into

603
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:44,094
exist Yeah. The other one was mortgage japan so great

604
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:46,085
Way.

605
01:06:46,462 --> 01:06:47,997
Yeah. And so I like.

606
01:06:48,469 --> 01:06:53,684
I just... I really like that the different parts of the earthquake are like

607
01:06:54,063 --> 01:06:54,563
identifiable

608
01:06:55,022 --> 01:06:58,212
as Terry or Fermi cost. You know? Right

609
01:06:58,789 --> 01:06:59,847
Yeah. It's a

610
01:07:00,544 --> 01:07:14,253
different budget earthquakes we get. Yeah And something I love with the sequence in the next few panels is now Al the current hs and doctor is so silly. So you don't really have to worry about all the millions of people who are dead or.

611
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:30,384
Ignore. Let's just assume that everybody's yes. Right. Because we're figuring, you know, the one that I was in was, like a six point nine, and that that's pretty bad. I think the San Francisco earthquake was, like a seven point nine

612
01:07:31,162 --> 01:07:33,397
but it's a long with scale, I think.

613
01:07:33,956 --> 01:07:42,411
This is gotta be like a nine or a ten where we're figuring. So, you know, that burgers is is gonna have a really bad day here. But we got some

614
01:07:42,788 --> 01:07:58,976
would be a horrific event, but the way he he presents it, you you're not you don't have to worry about. Right Actually we've got labels falling off with cans. We've got the pink being shaking off of the grocery store. And it's also... It's also imagine

615
01:07:59,289 --> 01:08:06,009
and this whole stories, but also just just the the little details of what happens to the buildings is also silly and original.

616
01:08:06,744 --> 01:08:07,244
Right.

617
01:08:07,623 --> 01:08:08,802
Yeah. Tim, any

618
01:08:09,421 --> 01:08:09,921
any

619
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:16,049
detail that you especially from the? For some reason, uncle screw ends up with the true head

620
01:08:17,589 --> 01:08:23,883
And I think that's really funny. It happen off crime camera, I think or must might have been one of the most panel.

621
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:36,472
Why you see him before that... But it just... It's just there It's just suddenly on his head, and it's like, yeah. This one the things I would probably do. Well, maybe that's what he did. Maybe he put it on, so he couldn't investigate the whole it.

622
01:08:37,368 --> 01:08:44,854
Right. I definitely imagine that it happened in the course of of the earth earthquake. Trying to hold on the room gonna put this jar.

623
01:08:45,573 --> 01:08:46,073
Seriously.

624
01:08:46,934 --> 01:08:47,094
Right.

625
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:58,542
So so the the first earthquake settles and the fermi... The terri and firm they realized that they haven't, you know, shaking the docks out yet. So they they give it to them again.

626
01:08:58,962 --> 01:09:07,349
Even worse than the first one, and we get this great moment. This is why Barks must have done that little bit of slap stick, having Scrooge head

627
01:09:07,729 --> 01:09:08,908
You wanna to tell us

628
01:09:09,448 --> 01:09:16,281
what what he says, So he says, I wish I could see my money bin has made out. Yeah. Well, we see these

629
01:09:16,858 --> 01:09:17,677
these guys

630
01:09:18,094 --> 01:09:19,752
not very cute anymore

631
01:09:20,129 --> 01:09:22,718
Mh. As we already found that. And

632
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:33,022
Donald, we're getting a another shaking This one is worth than the first one says you. My skin failed. I've been now. I've been an old junk.

633
01:09:35,594 --> 01:09:41,475
And I love the reading this course dutch that Joe doesn't work work. So wasn't that name Right.

634
01:09:42,233 --> 01:09:45,247
Right as the nephew pulls the the ancient

635
01:09:45,706 --> 01:09:49,973
jug off of his edits. It's the goofy you've been of it's

636
01:09:51,866 --> 01:09:56,676
they say home never looked so good and and Scrooge situations he could see his money bit probably

637
01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:04,169
is head covered. Right. And now we come to the part of the story in the course of this the second awful

638
01:10:04,549 --> 01:10:06,504
earthquake, it is the exact

639
01:10:07,042 --> 01:10:10,892
calamity that screwed feared and now has inadvertently

640
01:10:11,269 --> 01:10:11,769
caused

641
01:10:12,266 --> 01:10:15,159
because his whole money been bounces

642
01:10:15,497 --> 01:10:16,489
towards the shop

643
01:10:17,508 --> 01:10:23,641
And and the narrator box tells us. At this moment, the fur give with everything

644
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:26,973
they've got and in a very unlikely,

645
01:10:27,274 --> 01:10:43,143
but but wonderful cartoon slaps panel. The the floor of the band breaks open and all of his money pores down the shaft into Terry for me. What do you guys think of this panel? Well, I must say I'm a little bit disappointed

646
01:10:43,681 --> 01:10:44,181
because

647
01:10:44,677 --> 01:10:53,365
this could have been and maybe this is for my sort of yeah R I. Mh. Is could have been so much more dramatic.

648
01:10:54,263 --> 01:11:01,411
Really five if I would have drawn this one I I would have at least Yeah. Let the the the the money

649
01:11:02,349 --> 01:11:04,407
draw lots of coins

650
01:11:04,747 --> 01:11:16,892
everywhere all around, but more... I would've chosen different perspective, more from... I don't know. The the money really falling down towards the viewer more You know what I mean? Absolutely.

651
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:21,825
That's a great take. Yeah. I was live at this disappointed. I thought yeah.

652
01:11:22,918 --> 01:11:32,599
Have done it this week. Yeah. Maybe maybe I wonder if he chose to make it more funny. Because it's a really funny panel now. And it... So the different angle it would be more... Then it would be more like

653
01:11:33,192 --> 01:11:50,422
kind of traffic. Yeah. I'm more like the demo we're like in only a bright, which is really yeah dramatic moment and here. It's silly too because the buildings are flying any the air letters are enough the money business. So we really place it more funny than dramatically. Yeah. It was still. Yeah. I

654
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:58,698
something with the perspective as well. It looks like the the money been... Yeah. It's is tiny little. It's also does one one, which is not

655
01:11:59,876 --> 01:12:00,376
dramatically

656
01:12:01,392 --> 01:12:08,092
which is literally the sound effect that you make in English when like others a fall. Well

657
01:12:08,988 --> 01:12:09,488
nice.

658
01:12:09,866 --> 01:12:10,026
Right.

659
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:17,922
But but basically, so so basically, mount h you're you're telling him step it up a little bit, Karl Barks.

660
01:12:19,456 --> 01:12:24,159
Yeah. I'm so sorry. Yeah I have feel so seriously, I feel like

661
01:12:24,736 --> 01:12:27,510
Box... It's like I'm am nothing

662
01:12:27,967 --> 01:12:29,822
compared to him of course. And

663
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:32,308
I love this, but

664
01:12:33,046 --> 01:12:37,013
sometimes and especially, you know, in the in the in twenties.

665
01:12:37,429 --> 01:12:39,165
In these later years, I'm

666
01:12:39,741 --> 01:12:40,493
to this

667
01:12:40,912 --> 01:12:41,412
critical

668
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:43,882
more critical upon his...

669
01:12:44,258 --> 01:12:49,136
Yeah. The ways he's drawing especially course the deduct themselves. And... Yeah.

670
01:12:50,335 --> 01:12:55,030
Working about their own coverage. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So I'm I'm I'm really

671
01:12:55,543 --> 01:12:58,003
he he is the greatest

672
01:12:58,343 --> 01:13:09,972
and he will ever be the greatest. Well, and he was his own he was also a huge credit of his own work. Right? He he talked openly about things that he was disappointed by. But

673
01:13:10,471 --> 01:13:11,970
I think it's totally reasonable

674
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:15,341
to look at these stories critically. Right? I mentioned,

675
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:42,394
I I don't have the discerning artist by the eye that you guys have, but sometimes I will notice panels where Like oh that's drawn a little bit off. Right? U. He had so many stories that it's easy to imagine that maybe we're we're getting close to the end of this one and he just wants to wrap it up. Or maybe like Henri said he wanted have a little more of a slaps stick tone. Yeah. What where I do think it works, is that it's a very big

676
01:13:42,892 --> 01:13:49,392
broad moment that that is dramatic and it you know, we feel for Scrooge here. He

677
01:13:49,809 --> 01:13:53,378
he sees his life's work going down the drain basically.

678
01:13:53,716 --> 01:14:07,690
And and it's very fun. But but also very effect. Yeah. I I do really feel it's mostly played as fine, especially because in the in the next few pounds especially the first one on the next page. Duck discussed utterly ruined, but it looks so.

679
01:14:08,788 --> 01:14:09,288
It's.

680
01:14:10,186 --> 01:14:12,418
And just if you think about it it's just horrible

681
01:14:12,996 --> 01:14:13,156
Right.

682
01:14:15,072 --> 01:14:42,513
Those is also has to go Scrooge usual. So it's it's not very... It isn't played very dramatically Al all really silly. Right. Tonal, this is gonna stay fairly light, and it's gonna get resolved so quickly here. And honestly, this might be my own criticism of the story is that it's all... It's it's very brisk brisk, how how quickly this product many bark stories sometimes the ending really... Yeah Al comes at there was fun

683
01:14:43,693 --> 01:14:56,819
exactly. Although I want... I'm not sure if it's because of that worry. If it's I mean, he also likes the stories to be great tight so mh course, now, we are reading the the version that's longer than what he intended after had to treatments itself. Right.

684
01:14:57,552 --> 01:15:01,622
So we do get a little quick callback to the first uncle Scrooge

685
01:15:02,061 --> 01:15:19,328
Solo story. I'm only a poor man. He just spares, and Donald tries to point out that he could just send buckets down to haul it up, but but at this point after living through their earthquakes, he is too afraid. More afraid of the earthquake than he even wants his money back.

686
01:15:21,698 --> 01:15:34,723
Might be a bit of a stretch. But I mean, all change mind soon enough push sure anyway. Right. So so this next sequence here is takes us back to Terry for me. Do you wanna tell us about Tim about

687
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:38,511
about the problem that they have to deal with now? So

688
01:15:38,928 --> 01:15:51,178
the there in the firm are like what is the stuff that came pouring on the chef? Maybe it's something that old my Inducks and down an exchange for a trophy. If it is, it must be money. I heard broadcast saying he has tons of this stuff.

689
01:15:52,195 --> 01:15:57,765
They they were like, oh, yeah. Stan this stuff. And the nerve of sending this down an exchange for.

690
01:15:59,757 --> 01:16:03,493
Right. They they're quickly like, oh, it must be garbage basically.

691
01:16:04,312 --> 01:16:11,773
I mean, to them, it is anyway. Try to keep it away on that radio program. So they're they're really insulted. Right. It looks so installed.

692
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:14,324
Yeah. And and of course, being

693
01:16:14,781 --> 01:16:28,859
being sports hoo, they're gonna turn this into into a competition is how they wanna resolve it. They they want to have a contest to see... See about getting rid of the stuff and

694
01:16:29,278 --> 01:16:34,744
Henry, do you wanna tell us about a new trophy? Yeah. So this Terry or for me, I cannot.

695
01:16:36,599 --> 01:16:37,099
It's

696
01:16:37,437 --> 01:16:39,932
this is tearing on the old crowd

697
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:44,643
for and For the new term, is proposing the si cat deal Inducks

698
01:16:45,243 --> 01:16:49,363
they're programming along and this automated service much better in the old twenty.

699
01:16:50,536 --> 01:16:55,040
Because now it's it's also the trophy Al also part of that invention, I guess.

700
01:16:55,598 --> 01:17:08,331
Right. But, yes, they're making the have the new truth so the games will go on right. But now... And and what I like here is it now now there's actually a really nice huge for the the work pushing specifically

701
01:17:08,987 --> 01:17:14,049
because now they they can send all the money back up the shaft, and there's a good explanation for.

702
01:17:14,703 --> 01:17:20,923
Yeah. That's right. Even if even if the fermi method is is a little bit less like enchanting,

703
01:17:21,558 --> 01:17:41,264
than the terry, it definitely comes in handy for for the narrative here. It's also nice tight little, like, I like that structure of the story, right, where Scrooge is forced to discard his hat, and and that's all it took. To give them a new. And so you guys the story wraps up very

704
01:17:41,604 --> 01:17:42,363
quickly here.

705
01:17:44,281 --> 01:17:51,698
We get another rumble up the shaft and Scrooge here's before anyone else that the jingle of his money. And,

706
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:55,938
I guess we're we're meant to believe that basically every dime of it

707
01:17:58,155 --> 01:18:05,242
right Barks to the bin, which is it's it's a neat Gladstone car ish drawing, I think they are of the Bin.

708
01:18:06,242 --> 01:18:06,742
Around

709
01:18:07,603 --> 01:18:09,643
stuff to stuff to bursting.

710
01:18:10,418 --> 01:18:11,918
We're just hanging out.

711
01:18:13,618 --> 01:18:13,698
Yes.

712
01:18:14,938 --> 01:18:20,651
And... He's basking in his money and and in the very next panel, the fermi

713
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:28,415
have sent up a massive earth in plug that that completely blocks up the hole with a big chunk.

714
01:18:28,992 --> 01:18:32,923
And and the one of the nephews has just common the terry Fermi

715
01:18:33,381 --> 01:18:40,173
must not have liked the stuff. And upon the whole plug Donald says, wow, and they must not have liked us either.

716
01:18:41,473 --> 01:18:42,133
And so

717
01:18:42,713 --> 01:18:45,466
although Inducks is completely ruined, but

718
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:47,360
Right.

719
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:52,922
Right. And no one can probably prove that I I mean, I guess everyone knows about Scrooge

720
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:57,650
excavation. So he'll... I I guess it'll keep his construction businesses

721
01:18:58,307 --> 01:18:58,906
very busy.

722
01:19:01,393 --> 01:19:01,893
So

723
01:19:03,706 --> 01:19:03,865
right.

724
01:19:04,862 --> 01:19:07,795
Who wants to take us home with this goofy little

725
01:19:08,172 --> 01:19:09,031
sort of anti

726
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:10,521
sure ending.

727
01:19:11,017 --> 01:19:26,073
Yeah. Well, so Uncle Scrooge gets its money back and things are again as they were as we know. By now. So there's uv telling Scrooge that there is a professor from the university. Here to ceo On recruit. Cinnamon

728
01:19:26,813 --> 01:19:28,013
Scrooge says,

729
01:19:28,773 --> 01:19:30,793
enthusiastically, yeah, we see this

730
01:19:31,293 --> 01:19:44,893
University man sitting in front of the Scrooge. I just want to assure you, mister Mc that there will be no more earth earthquakes for many many years. The pressure is off. Where post causes

731
01:19:45,433 --> 01:19:46,614
earthquakes professor,

732
01:19:46,993 --> 01:20:00,783
Scrooge asks is man why a gas that builds up in fishers and the earth shrinks and then the last very last panel. He sure range been around as a partners.

733
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:03,678
So this is, of course, I

734
01:20:04,614 --> 01:20:06,686
I say it verizon? Callback?

735
01:20:07,284 --> 01:20:07,763
Yeah. Yeah.

736
01:20:08,998 --> 01:20:09,716
To what...

737
01:20:10,274 --> 01:20:11,904
What what this guy told

738
01:20:12,561 --> 01:20:14,775
screws before the bugs not

739
01:20:15,152 --> 01:20:27,760
having been around. Right a florida. Yeah. There's also a detail that's missing in the dutch one, the fact that they both have different dialects. That one uses, like, cowboys speak in the other one. As a Boston

740
01:20:28,194 --> 01:20:36,068
the is boston actions that's missing, of course, in transmission. It's it's funny. I such a epic story and and with fridge.

741
01:20:36,606 --> 01:20:42,614
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a very goofy slaps ending for... But it's. It's a nice closure.

742
01:20:43,033 --> 01:20:51,537
Yeah Now. I do too. It works for me. It's it's a odd in a wink, and it's obviously meant to be a wink at the audience even if we see the Inducks

743
01:20:51,896 --> 01:20:52,414
silhouette there.

744
01:20:53,426 --> 01:21:18,234
Wow. So you guys... That that is that is the story. That is land beneath the ground. I am totally interested in hearing your overall thoughts on it. I don't I don't know if I would go it, like, one of the best or most epic economics ever but of Barks, but just the it's so memorable and so imaginative and I think that's why I really stuck out me. It's not the one that I've read that's often it's...

745
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:41,327
Agent come up because this so much fun and yeah know, it's it's both... I mean, it's it's also a little exciting thing that mostly is really funny and these characters is just... So much imagination in there and course I read it when I was so young so to when you're so young everything is new to you, but There's so many, yeah know, this phone memories stuff this is so well and crazy. I've said it in in previous,

746
01:21:41,706 --> 01:21:45,279
because before the whole concept of Scrooge, of course, also insane.

747
01:21:46,279 --> 01:21:47,178
Well it's just...

748
01:21:47,718 --> 01:21:55,351
I love that I got to grow up with something. So imagine it Right do. Yes. Well, I for me this story is...

749
01:21:56,050 --> 01:22:02,236
It's a brilliant story. I love it. I love the drawings. I love the jokes. I love the dialogues

750
01:22:02,654 --> 01:22:11,069
and still for me, the problem in this story is I need horizon. I need air. And for me, this is

751
01:22:11,407 --> 01:22:16,577
a little bit, you know, I don't know. I miss... I miss... I don't know. The horizon.

752
01:22:17,035 --> 01:22:18,748
It's is that like class

753
01:22:19,245 --> 01:22:30,896
t this this lost to for me. This that's the point of it too. Course is the point of it. But, yeah, that plays Al role in my... Yeah in my feeling about.

754
01:22:31,314 --> 01:22:31,814
So

755
01:22:32,272 --> 01:22:34,209
yeah, this is why I always

756
01:22:34,786 --> 01:22:36,023
when I was creating this story.

757
01:22:36,598 --> 01:22:42,138
I always have this this same feeling of let's get out of this place. It's

758
01:22:42,478 --> 01:22:43,038
I don't know.

759
01:22:44,438 --> 01:22:45,118
Well. Yeah.

760
01:22:45,851 --> 01:22:59,781
Yeah. Because this that is the notable thing about this story is that it all takes place underground. And a cavern that so huge that it it might as well have a horizon. But I need see where you're coming from. Yeah. But you know, also

761
01:23:00,519 --> 01:23:04,727
there's nothing going on there. There is not eve... Yeah. There's moss. Okay.

762
01:23:05,765 --> 01:23:12,987
Would I need a tree or add bird or something? You know, and that's like I already said. It's it... That's

763
01:23:13,524 --> 01:23:14,024
somewhat

764
01:23:14,642 --> 01:23:18,055
makes me so I love the story, but

765
01:23:18,433 --> 01:23:20,948
it's not one of... It's not one of my favorites.

766
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:24,243
No one you like to get lost in basically Yeah.

767
01:23:25,523 --> 01:23:28,817
Right. Yeah. That's that's great to hear. That's that's really in thing.

768
01:23:29,775 --> 01:23:32,829
Successful this and with how if it makes feel Like

769
01:23:33,207 --> 01:23:33,707
very

770
01:23:34,125 --> 01:23:37,673
that's Barks. And manages to give me that

771
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:48,387
feeling of close to pho. And that's, of course, it's brilliant. Yeah. It definitely sticks with you. What about you, tim? Well, for me, I As a child, I really like this story,

772
01:23:49,168 --> 01:24:01,928
especially the the the build to the... The the mystery part of it. It's always what I really like about Barks economics, like, it always sets of these great questions and then things that are a bit off. And we you get this

773
01:24:03,067 --> 01:24:06,244
reveal after the build is is just was great

774
01:24:06,783 --> 01:24:23,778
kid. Yeah. So you big thing anthony You love that I read when it was young, but I was also so I'm gonna don't remember. I don't remember not knowing this story. So I don't know what it's like to discover to that's... Because they're still where your great Barks coins that I have yet to read. So I can't wait to find out.

775
01:24:24,418 --> 01:24:27,637
Although, a lot of it, of course has been spoiled million that's

776
01:24:27,938 --> 01:24:44,360
sure. I again again imagine what it it must be so great to read this story for first time I have no idea what's gonna happen. Yeah. There's a handful of stories where I think it's important if you're revisiting them to try to put yourself into that mindset of reading it for the first time. Yeah. You know, the golden helmet

777
01:24:44,818 --> 01:24:49,208
and this one, like, this is... I think this blew my mind is a kid.

778
01:24:49,781 --> 01:25:08,907
I think for me, this coincided with... I I think it was about the same age I saw the Ducktales version of it and those two things together, they were awesome to me. Yeah. I so... Yeah. Why don't we hold, I definitely wanna cover the dot towels one. I usually do, like, a little other media sequence.

779
01:25:09,286 --> 01:25:20,632
Right. But sure. But, yeah, that's... I mean, they I would have read it around the same time I saw that as well. Alright. And what I wanted to say was when I... Because I've read it every few years, but when I was with this

780
01:25:21,012 --> 01:25:33,110
visiting it to us and, but it's interesting I am I'm... Of course, I'm big coming on paper, and I always really I love with com how the whole page is also part of design, But lately have also been

781
01:25:33,567 --> 01:25:40,907
reading and digital using an app where you zoom in on the channel. And I noticed that reading the pages that way. It's like you're experience

782
01:25:41,446 --> 01:25:50,072
experiencing it really differently again, especially the the panels where the nephews go down to Severino when you really go panel by panel zoomed. It's so

783
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:59,882
cinematic and it really hits home and the way I originally read the call and I'm not sure if it's the same for you tim but... Yeah. Yeah. The in the netherlands and then in the nineties,

784
01:26:00,582 --> 01:26:54,886
they didn't published Barks that often in the magazine because it's mostly new material, but they would sometimes include special, like, mini mini booklet. So in two parts, this is one of the first ones I had. So in two parts that have this come and a separate booklet, but it's only half the size of the normal So it's actually Al tiny it's still... Especially with the seven one, I remember being so impressed by so even at this tiny ninety size. But yeah here... If you digital copies of comments or already try if you just have a paper one. Just try really going panel by panel and it's almost like... We it in a really different way. Yeah. Seeing the page as a whole. But that's why I love with Com because you're when you're drawing a page... The the whole page is like a composition. And... But every gun is also it's own... And it makes me wonder how this one might have been affected by the, you know, the removal of those panels. Because it it would throw off the pacing of. That's...

785
01:26:55,462 --> 01:27:24,187
It's also a thing and Barks that guess to where. And I think it's like an it it was impacting most of the story where you often would end a page with a cliff thing actually I really want to turn the page. If you pay attention to it dude he really does live a lot. Yes. Right. So Al little mystery at the end of the page, Huey, can be something silly too, but something that makes you want to go and I wonder when when these comments get cut up that sometimes it it gets ruined because then there a half page with shelf around and.

786
01:27:24,844 --> 01:27:45,947
I would be curious to see how it was originally. But it is. At least he got this story up himself and you got to add in little things to make the story flow better again. So... Right. As for my part, I I love this story. I think what you said Henri about you know, it may not be technically perfect, but it's just it's so audacious.

787
01:27:46,487 --> 01:27:49,435
The whole concept of it is so arresting

788
01:27:50,172 --> 01:27:55,992
and in en to me that even if it has a few flaws and faults around the edges,

789
01:27:56,406 --> 01:27:59,017
This is just such a a stunning concept.

790
01:27:59,912 --> 01:28:10,194
I think there is a a reason why this one stands out to so many people as, like, their favorite or or the Barks story or the comic book that they remember

791
01:28:10,691 --> 01:28:14,277
more than all the others because it's just got so much

792
01:28:15,055 --> 01:28:15,555
absorbing

793
01:28:16,493 --> 01:28:18,870
imagery. You know, just looking at those pillars

794
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,522
and the

795
01:28:21,061 --> 01:28:35,647
thousands of little fur and terry rolling around. I'd I never get tired of this one. Thinking back to it. This might be like the one that I reread, you know, the most as a kid because I just... I found it so fascinating and so fun

796
01:28:36,322 --> 01:28:46,148
and so absorbing. I I love this one so much. I I always think it's a shame how brief, like, how little time we actually spend with the terry and fur,

797
01:28:46,528 --> 01:29:07,507
and it's kind of a shame that Barks never went back and revisited them. But, you know, that's not his style. That wasn't his agenda. He he had he had had his fill of time to me a different part of the fun too because it's really... Like, will be really fun to write more with these characters, but that that's why it's nice because he left enough... Left enough space for everybody to imagine

798
01:29:08,003 --> 01:29:12,321
their own fuel fill in their own ideas of... Yeah. Where it's like So... Yes.

799
01:29:13,238 --> 01:29:18,534
Right. Yes. Well, that's actually what I find a little bit disappointing

800
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:21,207
sometimes that some artist...

801
01:29:22,143 --> 01:29:24,039
Some artist tends to

802
01:29:24,471 --> 01:29:27,006
fill up the gap the gaps that's

803
01:29:27,503 --> 01:29:30,596
Barks left open, and that can be...

804
01:29:30,934 --> 01:29:31,608
I don't know

805
01:29:32,586 --> 01:29:37,161
you would prefer these stories to kind of stand, I think, as their own testament.

806
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:44,093
Right have have that miss stick rather than trying to tell every little detail around I'm guessing

807
01:29:44,432 --> 01:29:52,500
I already enjoyed reading when people make their take on it, but then I do see it as there. It's their version. Right. Right. Not Cat.

808
01:29:52,959 --> 01:29:58,333
Yeah. Because I I didn't hear like I do enjoy seeing what people then come up with how they imagine.

809
01:29:58,932 --> 01:30:06,682
How for their imagination and they make follow ups, but then I do see it as like this their version and everybody can fit own through.

810
01:30:07,221 --> 01:30:09,978
Yeah. That's that's a couple of different philosophies.

811
01:30:10,392 --> 01:30:15,566
I understand why why you guys feel that Yeah. Yeah. For me, the Barks

812
01:30:16,105 --> 01:30:17,683
universe is sort of sacred

813
01:30:18,197 --> 01:30:21,774
I and I think that quite maybe so seriously.

814
01:30:22,472 --> 01:30:35,093
This, for example, this story is so it feels so good to just they it depends the story it ends there that the... Everything we know about these creatures and that's perfect.

815
01:30:35,707 --> 01:30:46,372
Right that. Yeah. It's it's a very tight story. I think you're right. It doesn't need more. Let's... I... I'm gonna hold off on the critical consensus to because that feels like a good segue to like other

816
01:30:46,872 --> 01:31:04,116
media. Right? Like like you mentioned it's actually surprising to me that as famous as this story is, there haven't been that many people that have done their own take on it. I did see that there was a very fun William van Horn follow where he used it Terry or affirm, I can't remember.

817
01:31:04,572 --> 01:31:11,445
I... But I really enjoyed reread it. It was in this issue with this just really gorgeous classic cover.

818
01:31:12,283 --> 01:31:13,262
Poor covering.

819
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:19,089
And and it was fun, but it didn't like it had a terry or a firm at the surface.

820
01:31:19,643 --> 01:31:22,543
And it it it wasn't very ambitious.

821
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:24,423
Right. It wasn't trying

822
01:31:25,043 --> 01:31:27,322
to tell, like land before time...

823
01:31:27,923 --> 01:31:29,797
Land beneath the grounds. To

824
01:31:30,135 --> 01:31:31,492
or anything like that.

825
01:31:33,128 --> 01:31:37,718
It it was it was story art in everything by Van Horn.

826
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:50,788
And was called Cr Comforts. And I I really liked it. I thought founded it a delightful but All follow And then like, even Don Rosa was more restrained, I think. Because he'd never did like a big follow to this one. He had them cameo

827
01:31:51,126 --> 01:31:59,392
in that center of the earth story, but he never like, tried to do a sequel to this one or... Yeah. The with since there. So... It did. Yeah. And It was

828
01:31:59,773 --> 01:32:01,912
to bus if I said story

829
01:32:02,452 --> 01:32:09,786
Right. But but again, it wasn't like trying to do land beneath the ground too or anything. So I like that. You mentioned the duck

830
01:32:10,283 --> 01:32:11,580
episode. I'm I'm gonna

831
01:32:12,053 --> 01:32:20,325
I'm gonna have a hot take. I think that duck tells episode is one of the best ones of the series. And one of their best ever Barks Al adaptation Oh, I do agree.

832
01:32:20,662 --> 01:32:34,892
Yeah. That's as well. Yeah. It's it's more... I I watched... It was coincidence I watched it maybe two months ago. And we watched it. And yeah. It's it's one of the best doctors that makes for great episode and great animation though.

833
01:32:35,668 --> 01:32:49,942
I have know, it's just it's always going to be a Al let down converter Exactly. It's it's nothing compared to the comment. But as far as, like, the the animated show goes, it's it's definitely a high point Boy, I remembered every word of it too once I started

834
01:32:50,358 --> 01:33:02,883
to rewatch it. Yeah. Was it is interesting to see also how because, of course, in a twenty minute episode and animation budget is Al and endless they staff to make certain. Yeah. Got some changes And month in our phone really...

835
01:33:03,323 --> 01:33:05,343
So one thing they did is that they basically

836
01:33:05,683 --> 01:33:17,103
put the for to together. They're still the two separate types, but they only do the rolling. And know yeah. Actually already mentioned, there's is no time course all isn't in there, which is the main reason. Right. Right. I didn't know like that

837
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:19,616
because of the in there to gifts

838
01:33:20,312 --> 01:33:25,375
areas all But at least they like ji rowe instead of, like, fe and cra or something.

839
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:33,923
More Barks in than normal. But one lady... I would have to much it again because it's it's been like, two months, but

840
01:33:34,702 --> 01:33:40,762
They... I think they really follow one of... They make one of the the little... The baby. The firm

841
01:33:41,143 --> 01:34:30,403
a main character so they really come, but doctors bring more kids, so it kind of makes sense that they they make... There's also like less less time to spend with the dairy for, so maybe you don't getting time to see how like they are. So I think that's decided like one of the baby characters as... They give them a bigger role, so you kind of have a way to relate to Dare. But it's interesting that they tell a bit of the story more from the side of that character. Yeah. I I liked it. I thought it worked. And and all the Mine Barks stuff was great. And it's one of the most foundation course. Yeah. It's one of the more iconic sequences from the opening of the show where he grabs hat coming down in the the My during the famous theme song. I would say that stands in contrast to the two thousand seventeen version of Ducktales. I I was I was pretty upset at the little ts.

842
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:35,425
Yeah. I don't think you're it now. But No. No. I've I've not seen But no that's.

843
01:34:37,812 --> 01:34:44,870
They they call the title. The the first one, the original is called Earth earthquake, and in this one, it's called the tear of the terra.

844
01:34:45,727 --> 01:34:55,464
It's if they're bought, it's a real tease because, of course, you're going to think. Yeah. Right. The show is not I don't think it's really angry of people or that's definitely not english

845
01:34:56,083 --> 01:35:00,139
trying to have it both ways, I think. It's fine would make the Barks references

846
01:35:00,478 --> 01:35:02,189
without really doing it.

847
01:35:02,686 --> 01:35:03,802
Yeah. There was... Well, I mean,

848
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:06,136
I haven't seen enough of the.

849
01:35:06,473 --> 01:35:32,288
I've I feel like it's a it's a good show by itself, but because they reference Barks are making references rather than capturing the spirit of Barks if you actually really to like Barks I'm sure there's also Barks expensive like the new show but for me that was the issue that it doesn't... It references it, but then it doesn't capture your the the I way early essence of it. So... It doesn't do anything with it. There was really no point. That's the thing. So they have they make an episode where that's called the

850
01:35:32,827 --> 01:35:38,852
and the the I would say they kind of Cameo, but they basically play no role. It's so.

851
01:35:40,585 --> 01:35:45,247
Like what. You see think you see them all the way at the end for, like a little bit, too Right.

852
01:35:45,584 --> 01:35:46,084
Yeah.

853
01:35:48,056 --> 01:35:52,822
I I I won't dwell on it, but I did wanna mention that a terra firm is is

854
01:35:53,199 --> 01:36:11,483
a boss in one of the levels in the old school Ducktales video game. So that's fun. Let's go ahead and and transition to the community consensus so we can get on route it up. Yeah. This one more thing I should mention though because that's something we found up kind of recently, but of course, I'm not from the Us, but for serious

855
01:36:11,901 --> 01:36:16,305
until recently had all these disney stores. And the ones in the ninth we said

856
01:36:16,841 --> 01:36:32,016
several different types of decorations and one of the ones that was across several stores was disney afternoon themes and one of the displays was a pretty big statue we were seen from Earthquake. So I can... I'll send you the pictures of it up on until

857
01:36:32,674 --> 01:36:42,737
know we're still around. I'm so glad you mentioned that. That was one of the stores that was near my house. Yeah. There's a few of them around the country that this these sculpture. So the

858
01:36:43,597 --> 01:36:45,897
good Ducktales is a sculpture

859
01:36:47,012 --> 01:36:47,512
third

860
01:36:47,972 --> 01:36:48,472
and

861
01:36:48,772 --> 01:36:50,312
nice sculpture too. It's

862
01:36:50,812 --> 01:36:54,927
I imagine for a lot of people. Even if they've never seen that bills with net or never

863
01:36:55,425 --> 01:37:02,901
economic but they if they've seen the store in in their mall for thirty years that that they know it from there. Right. It was very lucky.

864
01:37:03,357 --> 01:37:25,922
So So it sounds like we all think very highly of this story. You know, it's it's an emotional favorite of mine. Even if I don't think it's one of his all time greatest, it's It's almost like the big ideas and the the big concept that it has lifts it up. It elevate it a little bit more. And I think that's where the community lands to. Because if you look it up on Inducks,

865
01:37:26,241 --> 01:37:28,922
it has a very high rating.

866
01:37:29,442 --> 01:37:34,189
It's an eight point two as of right now, which is good for number sixteen

867
01:37:34,727 --> 01:37:38,260
out of all, you know, forty two thousand thousand three hundred.

868
01:37:40,370 --> 01:38:05,662
So people love this story. I think it probably gets inflated a little bit just because it is so memorable, but I I think it deserves be the conversation But is it... The I mean being the marble is what makes it itself. Right. Yeah. Exactly. It's just it's not one of the stories that has Al like, it doesn't have strong themes, like say only a poor man or the Golden helmet does.

869
01:38:07,949 --> 01:38:09,804
Some other stories Like, there's...

870
01:38:10,141 --> 01:38:18,022
Like, it's not... Doesn't get as tens or emotional which Only few really good births stores really do I think on Yeah.

871
01:38:18,942 --> 01:38:37,511
It's it's. It feels almost more the the tone feels but adventurous will also a bit more like the ten pages a lot will also to dial is so funny and clever all the time. Right. It's one of these things that makes Barks a bit meet so configure of other stuff that's so imaginative and wacky and right love it.

872
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:40,545
Yeah. It it it is just a wildly

873
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:50,552
entertaining story. You guys before we wrap up, does anyone wanna go to bat for any, like, specific panel that we didn't give attention to

874
01:38:51,372 --> 01:38:53,632
favorites? Yes. If I may,

875
01:38:54,092 --> 01:38:56,872
there's on the first page, we see the

876
01:38:57,292 --> 01:39:02,447
the worry room. Right? And it's funny because it looks like

877
01:39:02,987 --> 01:39:04,087
some of these rooms

878
01:39:04,467 --> 01:39:05,247
that you

879
01:39:05,907 --> 01:39:06,847
find in

880
01:39:07,507 --> 01:39:09,781
not houses wise where...

881
01:39:10,519 --> 01:39:21,688
It's an isolation room and it's, you know, it's it has this protected this these rules or detected by some Yeah. Decided wall and you can imagine that when

882
01:39:22,343 --> 01:39:23,852
screws really goes

883
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:25,250
insane

884
01:39:25,747 --> 01:40:02,679
worrying, he will smash his head against the walls. And I love these kinds of details so much. So I like Yeah. I love it. I love that. Yeah. That that is a nice touch. Thank you about. How I few, Tim. Any any that you wanna point out? I'm thinking of somewhat. I think might have both three been pretty thorough, I think. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. I love the whole sequence like I said were the just in terms of storytelling where the nephews go down Al Tahoe and that's it's really black bowel and of course, the big refill of the Severino. Yeah. That's Often my favorite panels are just three stupid faces that can

885
01:40:03,097 --> 01:40:03,456
Al

886
01:40:04,015 --> 01:40:26,197
argue. Yeah. I love the one... I've also mentioned the ones were the they start enrolling for the first design that is a pretty silly looking on and analytics this is great. That's a good one to advocate for because it's not one of the big, like, show panels. But it is... I mean, the show panels really are spectacular. And just that whole first page that this is among Barks. Best

887
01:40:26,734 --> 01:40:40,265
introduction pages. I think, panel for a panel. It does such a good job. Al the character. I totally agree. And by the way, there is on page two, I think you... You have this beautiful

888
01:40:40,724 --> 01:40:41,224
little

889
01:40:41,603 --> 01:40:42,197
Barks

890
01:40:42,456 --> 01:40:44,430
and a bridge and

891
01:40:45,125 --> 01:40:49,308
Scrooge and Donald walking there and you can... This is so realistic.

892
01:40:49,843 --> 01:40:58,358
It's a place we really can go and it's so simple and I love this zooming out and Yeah. Showing

893
01:40:58,778 --> 01:40:59,718
a bit of nature

894
01:41:00,338 --> 01:41:01,917
in this harsh

895
01:41:02,258 --> 01:41:02,657
city.

896
01:41:03,617 --> 01:41:04,497
I love it.

897
01:41:05,233 --> 01:41:13,452
Yeah. And that that panel you're right, that one is really lovely. Well, you guys thank you so much for joining me in this, like big

898
01:41:13,846 --> 01:41:14,785
Round robin

899
01:41:15,363 --> 01:41:19,095
rehash of this story. I had so much fun doing it. People

900
01:41:19,473 --> 01:41:26,412
can can check you guys out you're being You're all being published over there in Netherlands. I am both I'm both

901
01:41:27,269 --> 01:41:33,977
writing and a lot by the way at the moment. Especially the... How do you this club, the club of the

902
01:41:34,517 --> 01:41:36,577
club. The ones the four thousand

903
01:41:37,331 --> 01:41:37,831
Like

904
01:41:38,289 --> 01:41:47,267
the basically the four animals, so yeah a bit big wolf and. Oh, okay. Nice. Yeah. Slow unquote evil characters from the the four.

905
01:41:47,843 --> 01:41:49,498
They're owl fellows

906
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:51,189
Fine.

907
01:41:51,827 --> 01:41:54,239
It's more an established thing now

908
01:41:54,552 --> 01:42:08,687
think It was also a thing in Al Us economics with a few different characters, but it's really, like, a big established thing in the Dutch. Pos. Nice. Yeah. So I'm writing for... I love these the setting and with the big bad wolf, it's fellow

909
01:42:09,024 --> 01:42:09,524
criminals.

910
01:42:10,181 --> 01:42:10,681
And

911
01:42:12,190 --> 01:42:19,127
wolf is is always a fun character. Yes. I think so. I I I'm not allowed to draw it myself, but

912
01:42:19,706 --> 01:42:20,206
unfortunately,

913
01:42:20,705 --> 01:42:22,603
because they want me to produce

914
01:42:23,302 --> 01:42:24,220
Ducktales mainly.

915
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:25,639
So it's forbidden.

916
01:42:26,952 --> 01:42:33,563
And, yeah, I'm drawing now of course Al time every night having fun. That's excellent.

917
01:42:33,956 --> 01:43:02,633
I wish I wish they were still being published over here. I wish I could keep up with with the great comments being pushed out overseas. Yeah. The magazine is currently not running at all in the Us. Even right before it stopped, like the... Well, the the last few months, the last months so was in a year, if it was not very good. But before that they were putting out so many European economics and doing great translations of them. So hopefully, if there will be a license again and they get these editors again. I'm sure there will be more... Right.

918
01:43:03,709 --> 01:43:04,209
Your?

919
01:43:04,944 --> 01:43:07,677
