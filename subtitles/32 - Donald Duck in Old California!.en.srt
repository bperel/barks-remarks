Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of sc Mc and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge cl of all time, join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological

2
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:55,314
publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context, and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever marino, a grown man who still enjoys donald dot comics,

3
00:00:55,793 --> 00:00:58,965
and I'm joined by a returning guest

4
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:09,290
returning guest and her cat. Why don't you introduce yourselves? Al is on my lap. I hope his prayers are not too overwhelming, and my name is Sarah, Santiago

5
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:14,324
Thanks so much, Sarah for coming back. We're gonna be talking about the landmark

6
00:01:14,743 --> 00:01:16,721
story in old California

7
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,174
today. And and I'm very excited. This is a very famous

8
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:28,582
story among Carl Barks fans among fans dot comics. To me, it's it's reminiscent of the one that we

9
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,934
we recorded recently when we talked about dangerous

10
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:51,042
disguise in that it's a bit of a more mature story. And I'm excited to talk about this one because there is a lot to cover. There is a lot to cover. This is a story that stands out for a lot of people. I think a lot of people really remember it fondly. I feel like I should be

11
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,956
upfront about my own feelings

12
00:01:53,374 --> 00:02:03,023
with this story, which is that I do really like this one. But I don't cherish it as much as a lot of duck fans do. I I I get... I think I

13
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:08,625
understand why this one Barks. So highly and is so well remembered, but much like dangerous

14
00:02:09,084 --> 00:02:14,858
disguise. I'm wondering if I like read this one when I was a little bit too young. Because this one seems

15
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:15,737
geared

16
00:02:16,076 --> 00:03:00,494
towards more of an older audience. Forming me. Nostalgia isn't something you can sell to children. That's for sure. And this was so full of nostalgia. Yeah. I'm I'm glad you said that because it's a great point. You know, this this is really a hugely nostalgic work for him. Is is very focused on the past and and dwelling on this sort of like, forgotten ideals. So let's talk about this story. This was published, cover date was March of nineteen fifty one, and it appeared in four color number three hundred and twenty eight. It has about the average number of reprint eight, including the original publication and it's a twenty eight pager. So on the longer side, and this story is basically

17
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:04,398
It's a sort of fever dream, right? Where

18
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:10,180
Sometimes Barks likes to do this thing where i'll have the ducks go back to a pass

19
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:20,235
without actually doing the trope of time travel. But there's a few stories in these works where he'll do this. In summer fact. They travel through a vision

20
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:23,275
or, you know, through psychedelics or hall

21
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:32,361
drugs in this one. Back to to the past and it's gonna be this like shared dream of theirs. So it's it's very weird. It's very unusual

22
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:34,013
very nostalgic,

23
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:40,125
quite lovely. I was surprised how similar it felt to nostalgia

24
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,088
for about that time period that appeared later on. But it's it's really interesting

25
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:54,005
how we're taught to view the past as children. You're you're the way these adults are experiencing

26
00:03:54,902 --> 00:04:12,206
nostalgia amongst themselves. Yeah. And rep it for children. Like happy days. Right? Yeah. People people love to do this. They love to package nostalgia. It's always the past. It's always the good old days. It's always you know, in in the eighties, the fifties were the good old days. And in the fifties,

27
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:14,601
Gold Russia Era, California

28
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:21,298
was the good old days. Right? Yeah. And and for Carl Barks, right? You can tell that for him,

29
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:24,192
Nostalgia is before California.

30
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:29,910
Turned into what it what it was on its way to being in the fifties,

31
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:32,144
and that just accelerated.

32
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:36,148
It hugely. I'll take a moment here say that I'm a Californian.

33
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:42,920
I am perfect to to talk about this story. I was born in the eighties in the Bay Area.

34
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:49,893
So like, a lot of this story is really this digested version of the California

35
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,050
history

36
00:04:51,785 --> 00:05:04,055
quote, that we got spoon fed to us in fourth grade history class. You know? That I was like, oh my gosh. This is beat for beach. So much of the stuff that I learned about in school. And

37
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:21,726
you get older and you start to learn that, you know, the the backbone bonus of some of that stuff is true, but of course, it's leaving a lot out history is written by winners. And and this is really Al and fetish us a kind of pass that probably was never really the case in California,

38
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:23,482
but you can tell that

39
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:25,676
Carl Barks is already

40
00:05:26,428 --> 00:05:41,153
recognizing where California is heading with the the beginning of this story and and the congestion and the sp. And i I understand the instinct to pine for that sort of simpler time. Yeah. It... It's definitely a very human

41
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,986
instinct. I listened to a podcast

42
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:48,835
It's now called build for tomorrow, but it used to be called the Pe

43
00:05:49,254 --> 00:05:53,990
archive and he started to kind of look into when was this

44
00:05:54,304 --> 00:06:03,097
time period when America was great. And he traced back to the beginning of writing itself. The Romans

45
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:39,029
had their own version of all the good old days. Things now just aren't the way they used to be. I pine for these old days That kind of nostalgia is extremely Huey,. Right. Every generation likes to complain about the one that comes after it. So let me let me talk about a little bit of the background trivia because there's a there's a good amount of it. I did mention that this is one of the best reviewed best regarded of Barks stories. We'll we'll get to the actual ranking later, but I will note that if you kind pull out only the Donald duck stories as opposed to the uncle Sc ones, this is his third best

46
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:53,217
regarded or best remember Donald Duck story. The only ones that are ahead of it and the rankings are lost in the Andes and the golden helmet. It's just barely ahead of vacation time. And and there's a good few quotes about this one.

47
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:58,534
In a nineteen sixty two interview, we had one of those moments,

48
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,368
Sarah, where he

49
00:07:00,864 --> 00:07:15,255
indicated that this was his favorite story. The one that he thought was his best and and I'm chuck a little bit because this is the third episode I've done now where he I have a quote revealing which story he thought was his favorite, which was his best one.

50
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:19,364
But it makes sense. You know, he had a very long career

51
00:07:19,784 --> 00:07:30,524
in nineteen sixty two, he was I think still writing them. So we he had some of them still ahead of ahead of him, but he he had over five hundred stories if he count everything he did. So

52
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:44,424
it's natural that he might change his mind over the years. But he he's mentioned lost in the Andes being a favorite mentioned land of the tote poles and this one. So now now that I've got three of these down. I'm I'm gonna keep paying attention to these quotes.

53
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:49,055
But he said the one story I always liked best was in old California.

54
00:07:49,473 --> 00:08:03,996
I created an atmosphere and then kept that fear through the whole story. Composing these stories is like writing music. You've got to have the beat and keep the whole thing going. I think that's fair. I think he did do a great job of maintaining a certain

55
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:06,273
dream like hyper realistic

56
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:07,312
pin

57
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:28,061
atmosphere in this one. And then you and I did dangerous to disguise a little while ago. We talked Al length about how that was the last story that he got away with using real humans on And I I bet you can guess that he wished he could done it for this one. Right? Because these the characters in this... They are

58
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:29,114
so

59
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:30,033
stunning

60
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:33,728
human, and I was just in awe...

61
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:39,837
We'll when we talk about our favorite panels, I'm gonna bring up panels where he depicted

62
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:41,954
these animal human,

63
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:42,993
but with

64
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:47,161
specifically human people features. Yeah. Absolutely.

65
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:53,119
I might say that these characters are more human than the humans in dangerous

66
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:56,747
disguise in some ways, because a lot of those were very care,

67
00:08:57,084 --> 00:09:00,692
you know. Just just... We had some exaggerated figures

68
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:12,112
and some like, archetypes like the Fe fatal, but I I think he's going for a real, like, story book romance in this one. That's the other a fascinating thing to me that this is a romance.

69
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:25,415
This this is almost is could be a romance novel, Donald and the Ne user are at times kind of incidental to the story. It sometimes seems like they're only there to perpetuate the romance.

70
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,129
Instead of the other way around, the way

71
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,290
ancillary characters

72
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:53,630
serve the story of the ducks. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Let's see Barks was also known to talk about the setting. He did say for this one, no settings are taken from life, but the type of houses and terrain are recognized local. And then can we list a couple of the titles from around the world, Sarah? Or. If do you want me to start? Yeah. Why don't you go with the the, you know, location

73
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:55,128
specific titles?

74
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:56,826
Sure. In

75
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:59,479
Mexico and Spain had different...

76
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:01,719
The the Spanish and the Mexican,

77
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:07,291
even though they're, you know, ostensibly the same language, they've come out with different

78
00:10:07,788 --> 00:10:10,220
titles where Mexico is in

79
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:11,477
California

80
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:13,351
and Spain's is

81
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,547
California.

82
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:24,251
And you and I had talked previously about the word Giga where it it it... The definition is more ancient, but in this

83
00:10:24,764 --> 00:10:25,264
specific

84
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:27,581
meaning, it's more like antique

85
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,139
And whereas,

86
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:46,537
California is more old. Which is a direct translation. Right. Yeah. That's the connotation that I feel like they're going for there. And then we have a lot of most least straight up translations of in old California. This a pretty important title to keep consistent. So

87
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:50,070
we've got ones like then the danish is

88
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,950
e go ga, Californian.

89
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,710
French is rat on,

90
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,724
which is back to California,

91
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:01,917
Germany is a direct one, Emailed.

92
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:06,960
The only one that stuck out to me was just Italy is

93
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,680
Would be donald in the past kind of kind of weirdly emitting

94
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,640
California.

95
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:15,333
So we're we're almost

96
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:19,045
ready to start talking about the story itself. But

97
00:11:19,463 --> 00:11:25,130
the thing that I haven't even mentioned yet is that this is kind of oddly

98
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,370
a literary

99
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,550
adaptation.

100
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:41,850
We've we've got Barks based adapting this really well known piece of literature, a story called Ra ramona that was written in the late nineteenth century tree by Helen Hunt Jackson.

101
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,850
So Helen hunt Jackson and wrote this historical

102
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,810
novel called Ramona. That was

103
00:11:48,844 --> 00:12:08,265
that this is very loosely based on it. But you can I can see the bones of it. Right? So it's it's a story of this So so it's a story of of a half scott Irish half native American orphan and her lover, and it's basically like a a romeo and Juliet doomed love type of story. And and she had this mission

104
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:13,245
that was to get Americans to reconsider their treatment of native Americans.

105
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:17,465
She really wanted to, like, affect policy and and benefit welfare

106
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:24,185
for for native Americans. And and I think that's pretty awesome. You know, It's definitely gonna look pretty dated

107
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:30,080
based on, like our future version, but it was from a very progressed a very idealistic

108
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:57,764
mindset at the time. It was it was essentially supposed to be like a native equivalent of uncle Tom's cabin, which again was a very progressive minded work at the time. And so Ramona was very personal for Carl Barks. Right? Because they... The... His his community of San ja Sci would do this pageant every year that is locally famous and and is somewhat famous around the world because it's the

109
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:01,525
longest running outdoor pageant in the United States.

110
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:04,511
Next year is going to be its centennial

111
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:09,294
hundredth anniversary and the venue that it's at is actually called the ramona.

112
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:17,607
So i I thought that was pretty interesting. I didn't know anything about this Sarah when I went to do the episode. Yeah. I

113
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,540
It felt when I was reading it before I knew anything about Ramona, that the rodeo

114
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,595
felt different. It didn't feel like a rodeo in the way that we

115
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:33,569
understood it. So I was wondering maybe is this is this part of

116
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:38,359
you know, this the Spanish culture of the time, Mexican culture,

117
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:41,650
what was going on with that. But as an homage,

118
00:13:42,424 --> 00:14:01,035
to a beloved childhood festival. Sure. That sounds right. Yeah. And and I think Barks talked about, you know, it was kinda like his little inside joke. He wanted these these stories, he didn't get credit for them. But I think he liked the idea that his neighbors could see this on the news stand and recognize

119
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:05,675
you know, local staff local elements. And he they did mention,

120
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,295
but it was just a quick throw away reference.

121
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:20,612
Right. Yeah. You're right. They mentioned that. So so there there's a lot to talk about. Why don't we go ahead and get into the meat of the story unless you had any other comments. Let's go. So in old California

122
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:24,128
opens up on that most Californian

123
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:25,367
of

124
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:27,419
occurrences, a terrible

125
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:34,211
traffic jam. This is something that we see in a few Barks stories. He complains a lot about progress

126
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:57,044
year about just turned fifty as he wrote this. Right? So this is very easy for me to picture. But but Don on the nephews user in that kind of traffic jam where you're like, risking life and limb and it feels very unpleasant to be in and they have to take a side road to a escape what they call the honking jam. And this gets the kids to talking

127
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:59,978
about what life was like in California

128
00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:02,094
before before the automobile

129
00:15:02,432 --> 00:15:07,761
took over. And it does specifically call out that their site seeing near Los Angeles.

130
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:22,860
So we don't have Duck like formally. I don't think it's established as their hometown at this point. Sarah. He's referenced like Burbank Barks a few times. But... But the docs have always basically been Californian

131
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:37,834
in his stories. I've gotten that feeling from the ones that I've read too. So Don is kind of... He's taken that on the next page down this, like, sleepy back road. And they're talking very... He's talking very wi fully and nostalgic

132
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:53,460
about what the land used to be like, and and he's he's really talking about the time before it was the United States. Right? They don't He doesn't ever explicitly say this other than to say that big Spanish ron chose covered thousands of acres.

133
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,420
They talk about all the

134
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,300
wildlife

135
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,466
and and game that we're there. They talk about the

136
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,381
Indians, the native Americans

137
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:09,974
that lived in the area. There is a panel where the boys one of the boys Barks weren't they savage

138
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:12,928
Indians, un donald, and and he

139
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:19,726
them that no, these guys were figured that having fun was more fun than fighting. And he characterize

140
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:21,042
them as being

141
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:21,739
smart.

142
00:16:22,258 --> 00:16:23,450
I think he's talking about

143
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:34,895
everyone in this era, not explicitly the Indians because he talks about them building the missions that you've heard about and pointing out a mission here. And this is really complicated,

144
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:36,330
Sarah because

145
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:40,209
this is like a really interesting white wash

146
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:47,089
gloss over of California like like the rest of the United States had some very rough history

147
00:16:47,444 --> 00:16:49,140
Right? And and some terrible

148
00:16:49,637 --> 00:16:50,895
exploitation. But...

149
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:54,125
Sorry. I'm I'm getting stuck on this. Right? Because this is

150
00:16:54,463 --> 00:17:02,970
this is such a gl of the past. But in some ways, the the area was more, I think, mixed

151
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,210
and integrated back when it was old Mexico.

152
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:10,865
What struck me about this section

153
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:20,954
was that Indians lived in villages along the streams and dance and made whoop be every few minutes. And what does that mean?

154
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:39,034
When you send me the article about Ramona, and about how it was meant to be, you know, the uncle Tom's cabin but for Native America of its time and and how it didn't actually catch on that way. It made me think of this

155
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:41,285
characterization of native Americans

156
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:42,165
as

157
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:43,085
him

158
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:44,325
trying.

159
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:48,458
He he doesn't have the level of

160
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:50,097
acceptance of

161
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,694
understanding what's the history

162
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:54,851
how the Us has

163
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,930
wrong

164
00:17:56,404 --> 00:18:04,155
native Americans. But I get the feeling that he thinks he's doing a good job by saying, no, they're not savages,

165
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:06,228
they're this completely other

166
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:07,347
insert pate

167
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:11,423
description here. Yeah. I... This is very pate,

168
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,115
but it but it's very well intention

169
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:23,496
It shows I would say a little bit of growth from the story I did a few months ago land of the tote pulls,

170
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:29,743
This this is definitely a high point in his representation of native Americans.

171
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:33,194
It is it should be said it's totally in keeping

172
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:41,045
with the average like mindset of the time. Honestly, it's it's probably a little bit more positive than the average mindset.

173
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:58,910
Of its time because it doesn't. I mean, we'll we'll get to those characters soon. But you asked about making whoop be Miriam Webb says that informal old fashioned is to have noisy fun And I think that that's how I read it. It's it's like war whoop, you know, it's the cliche like

174
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:07,293
making making that kind of noise and just having a good time. So, you know, the this page ends with them

175
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:12,905
transitioning back So he kind of talks about what became of California

176
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:21,636
as they pass a bunch of noisy billboards Barks and he's like, well, you know, Gold was discovered in eighteen forty eight in California.

177
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:26,951
Barks is basically tracing that as the the time when California

178
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:33,465
took a turn for the worse. Right? Because it drew in all these people and all this development.

179
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:43,211
But the docs continue to drive deeper into the bat country and they're just sightseeing seeing and they pass one of these local references that we mentioned

180
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:53,409
where they they talk about seeing the town where Ramona once lived. Right? Clearly, she's not a fictional character in this. She's like a historical person.

181
00:19:53,867 --> 00:20:05,343
They talk about how they would have loved to have met her they pass a sign that says there's the Ramona pageant bowl and they're distracted by a sign talking about an Indian reservation and the Ducktales

182
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:07,200
crash really brutally

183
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:09,095
into a large boulder.

184
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:20,897
So pretty violent looking crash. This would probably kill the sucks. So we got some cartoon logic here. But when the ducks come to they're at that reservation. And they've been taken

185
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:23,930
to see the medicine man and they're given

186
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:26,086
this like medicine

187
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:36,379
that has kind of a smoky look to it. The the Indians... Sarah, what what do you notice? Would you describe the native Americans for us? They're they're wearing

188
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:44,404
the quote unquote medicine man is wearing a vest. It has fringes. It appears to be leather, kind of a stereotypical

189
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:46,038
modern

190
00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:47,872
depiction of

191
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:51,075
what white Americans think native Americans where

192
00:20:51,494 --> 00:21:02,663
it appears to be leather, but then in the next panel, the medicine man or somebody else is handing over the herbs that the ducts are so supposed to drink. And do you see that native American

193
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:06,254
man from behind and it has an a one

194
00:21:06,672 --> 00:21:07,172
flower

195
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:13,765
stitched on. I think it's supposed to have been made from a Al old sack. Right. Right. Which is just...

196
00:21:14,765 --> 00:21:21,410
Can they just wear clothes? I mean, I think it's supposed to represent the the poverty that many of them are in.

197
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:22,668
But it's...

198
00:21:23,206 --> 00:21:25,103
But without the context

199
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:27,990
to tell us this is poverty,

200
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:29,584
you know, we don't

201
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:38,455
understand, like, do they choose to live this way? Are they stuck in this way because of decades of policies,

202
00:21:38,954 --> 00:21:49,843
of course, because they all assume context it was very frustrating for me as well as the way that they're depicted, their language is depicted. Right? It makes them

203
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:58,770
appear to be less fluent in English, we all know what less fluency means. It means less intelligent

204
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,378
to that kind of a an audience. It's just very frustrating

205
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:20,775
today. Yeah. I think that's understandable. You know, their their dialect is basically Hollywood Indian. Hollywood native and it was so expected that even in a story like land to the Tote poles were the Ducks encounter a group of natives that have never met

206
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:36,950
outsiders. He still has them speak in this kind of English which obviously doesn't make any sense. So this was like this deeply brain trope. But this is we're getting the stereotype of the happy Indian. They're all very, they're very simple. They're happy

207
00:22:37,345 --> 00:22:38,525
they're very pleasant.

208
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:39,885
It's very pate.

209
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:51,860
Someone who's smarter than me can argue whether it's more or less harmful than the kind of stereotype that we usually were presented with. But the Ducktales basically start to feel the effects of these herbs

210
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:56,829
right away, as the natives are doing these like whoop

211
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:02,800
noises around them. And as they kind of fall into this fever dream, One of the Nephews.

212
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,240
They they're talking about how I feel sleepy. Like I'm sort of going into a dream

213
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:24,225
and one of the nephew says, I feel like we're living, you know time long long ago. Like, this is the part of the story that I had trouble getting past as a kid. Right? Because this is such a like fantastic thing to just kinda hand wave past. I thought it was a very weird

214
00:23:24,684 --> 00:23:52,199
transition, and it really... It it pulls me out of this story a bit. Oh, card, it makes so much sense to me in cartoon logic. Right. At the time, you know, child me would have been going right along with it. Of course, that's what happens when you're about to fall into a drug sleep. Sure. Right. And and what I liked about these comics is that Barks doesn't usually do like the the true cartoon logic, you know, like animals and stuff. There's like a small degree

215
00:23:52,817 --> 00:23:57,553
more realism than that. But anyway... The transition is really interesting

216
00:23:57,972 --> 00:23:59,830
because he's got them

217
00:24:00,144 --> 00:24:01,843
doing their weird dancing,

218
00:24:02,342 --> 00:24:06,518
Hollywood Right. A native American dancing in silhouette in their

219
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:18,942
clothes that they have on in the modern day And then as they're falling asleep, they're still doing even more exaggerated into those shapes, those dancing shapes. But it's very clear that the silhouette people

220
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:27,416
are not wearing modern clothes. I... Right. As much as I hated it from a depiction of native Americans

221
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:29,628
standpoint it made sense

222
00:24:30,047 --> 00:24:52,740
logically. In that that kind of logic. Right? Right. You see the transition happening. If it took me along with it. It wasn't just proof all of the sudden. It took me along with it. Nice. So that's interesting. This transition works a lot better for you than it does for me. It is it is drawn lovely. So as we transition with the du, you know, it's clear to the reader.

223
00:24:53,234 --> 00:24:59,979
That they have gone back to long ago that we see now this this reservation is now a native village,

224
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:06,086
the Indians or dressed the way we might have stereotypical typically guessed they would

225
00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:07,325
hundred years

226
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:11,241
before The architecture of their housing has changed

227
00:25:11,754 --> 00:25:39,166
Yeah. I do. I do appreciate that it looks like it looks like the buildings, I didn't like research it or anything, but it looks more realistic than him just throwing up a bunch of t gps. You know, they're like, more permanent structures than that, which I think would have been the case around then. And so the Ducktales go back to look at their car. And they're basically wandering through what is now a wilderness. And they're puzzling over what has become of the car, Why do they see nothing, but cat and ante

228
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:48,475
know, it's taking them a long time to figure out what's happened. I did wanna go back to the the architecture. I don't think that it would have been

229
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:52,304
in this part of the country. That's a very specific

230
00:25:52,642 --> 00:26:06,116
true right group of scribes. Yeah in a different part of the country. So I wonder if he you were telling me off my that it felt like even though it was kind of cringey and the depiction with the native Americans

231
00:26:06,493 --> 00:26:13,232
in the other one, that you had read. It was still very clear he had done a lot of research

232
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,760
and and got some details

233
00:26:16,219 --> 00:26:18,874
very right. So I wonder how much was

234
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:27,389
of this where he was like, okay. What kind of dwelling did the people of this time period in this part of the country,

235
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:32,670
and then, you know, he couldn't couldn't bother to, like, portray them with, like, any

236
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:33,670
intelligence,

237
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,350
but he could accurately

238
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,910
draw a round

239
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,270
with a fast roof for the. Yeah. I wanna I wanna

240
00:26:40,904 --> 00:26:59,615
say that without doing the research, I suspect that he made sure to get these details right. That's just my read And I and I think he was very well intention with this one. I think like Helen Hunt Jackson story, who which is probably not aged well that he was really going for for what would pass for a respectful

241
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:00,695
kind

242
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:05,615
representation in a kid's comment. Right. It's a new tried.

243
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:06,195
Yeah.

244
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:12,782
He tried. So the Ducktales continue to walk through the wilderness,

245
00:27:13,121 --> 00:27:24,180
and and they it takes I'm noticing, but the mountains that they saw before on their drive are now covered with Timber, in the manner that they must have been a hundred years before

246
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:52,274
They haven't quite connected the dots, but but they're gonna go back and see that medicine man and figure out why he's made their car disappear And and on the way, Donald encounters a g bear in a place where he said, oh, they've been extinct here for eighty years. And so, you know, they're hiding behind a rock from these g and they're just putting it together that they're seeing wild bears, ante, no roads, no towns.

247
00:27:52,611 --> 00:27:56,222
They kind of figure out retroactively that the the natives look different.

248
00:27:57,118 --> 00:27:58,296
They were wearing bucks

249
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:02,940
clothes. Oh they reference the house being Adobe hut. And when in the Nephews

250
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,020
establishes, and he he calls it out. We are dreaming

251
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,980
that we're in old California.

252
00:28:09,694 --> 00:28:20,351
So this is this is pretty weird. Right? This is interesting. We've got this story now where we're we're given the setup that the ducks are having a dream and they know that they're in a dream, and

253
00:28:20,768 --> 00:28:22,743
they're gonna go forward and basically

254
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:47,063
have the attitude of let's go ahead and enjoy this shared dream well we've got it. So Donald is reflecting. He's he's gonna agree with them. You know, This dream business does seem possible they that they've woken up a hundred years ago. One of the nephews calls out that now we're in the days of the missions and the ron shows and the the ranches and the pretty senior like Ramona. And so they decide to get into the spirit of old California.

255
00:28:47,801 --> 00:29:16,147
This is kind of that tourism. Right? They're they're gonna go ahead and be tourists in the past. And Donald calls out, hey, the nice thing about a dream is that you can never get hurt, but that's immediately proven wrong as a bowl charges into him as these crossing the field. So they're they're like figuring out okay, This isn't like the regular kind of dream. We need to be we need to be careful And so they decide to make their way through the grass lands watching out for bulls, hiding and trees.

256
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:28,415
At some point, they need to, like, Maneuver past to field pull full of bowls, so Donald creates like a little straw dummy and all the bulls zero in on him and crash into each other

257
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:36,305
landing in a big old heap. That's a pretty funny little bit. Pretty clever too. Yeah. And after a while, you know, they're becoming really tired.

258
00:29:36,805 --> 00:29:40,205
They're really yearning to see some some kind of a settlement.

259
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:53,372
And eventually, they come across the old run show that they passed that morning, but now it is in its full glory as it would have looked a century before. So Donald speculate that, you know, it's probably

260
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:58,345
occupied by an old Spanish, dawn and his family and their Indian service.

261
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,340
Oh

262
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,460
Right. Yeah. So I mean, we've got this

263
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,140
probably pretty accurate

264
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:11,957
representation of the politics, the culture of the area. Right? You've got this mix of people from

265
00:30:13,074 --> 00:30:15,448
Spain. You've got people who are like my,

266
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:17,898
better what we would call Mexican.

267
00:30:18,237 --> 00:30:30,845
You've got full natives. This is the dynamic that's presented in Ramona. I just I just hated that there was it's probably accurate, but I also just hated how presented without commentary

268
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:33,615
their quote unquote, Indian servant.

269
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:44,891
Yeah. It's it's not a great look. And and I guess this is kind of a part two where it it stray from the ethos of ramona itself. Right? Because

270
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:48,690
Ramona from what I I didn't read remote, but my cliffs notes

271
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,850
understanding of it is that it really does try the center

272
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:55,529
the story around a woman who has some native heritage.

273
00:30:55,924 --> 00:31:15,912
And and comes to know that and accept that. And I don't think that's the case for the main one that we're gonna meet here. But the decks the docs decide that they can't approach this, just asking for the food that they're starving for. So Donald convince them that they've gotta make them think there were travelers dropping by in an old California

274
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:21,026
style. So they they go in dancing and singing, like, an old

275
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:22,238
Mexican

276
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:23,076
style,

277
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:23,953
yay.

278
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:31,701
It's very cringey. It's very awkward. I did not like this part as the kid like, it's so

279
00:31:32,197 --> 00:31:33,693
true to Donald character

280
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:38,570
right where he just makes assumptions instead of asks questions.

281
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:54,558
Yeah. It feels like the kids are kind of on vacation from their critical thinking brain too because usually, they're the ones that are like I don't think that's how it goes uncle donald. But they just like, oh, sure, I'll believe anything. You're the expert on old California. Let's yay.

282
00:31:55,454 --> 00:32:00,859
Right. And he did mention that he read a book about it at the beginning. So I guess that's why he's an expert.

283
00:32:01,515 --> 00:32:19,771
And I'll note that despite how I how it struck me. I I think it's supposed to read as very charming. Like naive charming is how I think it's supposed to read And so now we're gonna come to a segment where we meet we meet the members of the Hacienda. We meet the people at this run show. And it is

284
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:27,377
everything to do with the Rancho show is just beautifully drawn. Right? Like, we've got some lavish lovely

285
00:32:27,716 --> 00:32:28,216
detail

286
00:32:28,675 --> 00:32:42,255
that interior, the exterior, the people, the fiesta that we're gonna get to meet. This is a real highlight of the story and I think it's a big part of what people love about this one, Sarah. It's so evo.

287
00:32:42,755 --> 00:32:59,159
You and and comm. It if this is where he gets into that, like, just bark at his best and how he is just such a great communicator in the medium of of drawing. And it's it's so

288
00:32:59,738 --> 00:33:08,749
simple and concise. And and I just I just loved it. I love the art in this part. Yeah. No no argument here. This art is gorgeous.

289
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:23,765
And this is kind of where we meet the main characters of the story in a way. And we're gonna get introduced to them very quickly and like you said, we're gonna just from looking at them. We're gonna know immediately what they're like. You know? We we see a young woman

290
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:25,643
talking to her mother

291
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:33,642
a lovely young woman. Talking to her mother, who's the don. She's very stern looking. Donald

292
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:34,639
approaches

293
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:36,448
port

294
00:33:36,865 --> 00:33:39,238
native woman who must be one of these servants.

295
00:33:39,973 --> 00:33:43,143
He greet her by saying high poc

296
00:33:44,014 --> 00:33:44,514
oh

297
00:33:45,570 --> 00:34:10,599
I'm just quoting this. Right? I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say his line, he says hi Poc tell the head man, we've come to dance the fan dang and his fiesta. This doesn't read the same way it does today after you know, we we had a couple years ago, Donald Trump using this as a slur. This this has always been used as little bit of a an insult or a casual, but it's it's meant to be like a casual

298
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:19,994
hiya here. They wouldn't read the today. Here. Right. And she is a no nonsense woman. She asked you know, fiesta.

299
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:25,414
And she asks him, why would he think that I'll read the dog's full name because it's great.

300
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:27,567
Fernando

301
00:34:31,622 --> 00:34:39,639
gives... Why does he give a fiesta? And Sarah do you know what the joke here is with the name apart from it being one of those classically long

302
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:40,875
Spanish names?

303
00:34:41,452 --> 00:34:48,468
I mean, no. That's the only one that I picked up on. I mean, that that part is great. But there are a couple of local...

304
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,681
There are a couple of local roads.

305
00:34:51,614 --> 00:34:55,074
Embedded in that name. Paul Al a famous Southern California.

306
00:34:55,614 --> 00:35:10,583
I think B and D as well, that's just something he threw in for locals I I lived most of my life in northern California, but I did spend a little bit of time. I I spent a summer in in Santa Barbara and tooling around down south. So And so he.

307
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:35,605
So, you know, Donald is kinda realizing he's gotten off on the wrong foot. He's just saying that you know, he really wanted one of their famous barbecue with free eats. He's like making all these assumptions about about how life works then. And and the Dawn has been listening from the other side of the door. He has realized that these are not dangerous people. They're just some be will boys, lost and hungry,

308
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:38,876
he puts away his shotgun which he is very reasonably

309
00:35:39,255 --> 00:35:46,762
holding and he greet them warm saying that the table of Don gasp is always loaded for those who come in friendliness.

310
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:51,755
And and a lot of this story now is gonna be kind of about this like friendliness and

311
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:54,006
Al. Mh. Because

312
00:35:54,345 --> 00:35:58,557
the members of the rancho are going to show them some

313
00:35:59,015 --> 00:35:59,515
tremendous

314
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:01,644
hospitality, and you can see that Barks

315
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:11,377
loves this idea. Right? The the young woman calls out to bring them food and drink and to sit and the the dawn calls out for beds.

316
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:18,740
The dawn calls out for clean linen and hot tubs for that for the dusty travelers, which the Nephews are very

317
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:31,039
acutely gonna be dismay Al being vague to take a bath. And we get this really lovely little panel that's almost like Al almost like a movie post or the cover of a Romance novel on this page.

318
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:32,779
Where he highlights

319
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,834
Barks narration box

320
00:36:35,253 --> 00:36:35,753
says,

321
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:49,899
do you do you wanna read the narration box for us Sarah? Just like that Donald did his nephews from the year nineteen fifty one become guests of people who lived in the romantic days of long ago, this channel It has

322
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:57,295
this is my favorite panels of of this comic. Oh, yeah. It has... It it and it feels very much like a d.

323
00:36:57,631 --> 00:36:58,650
Right, of

324
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:05,041
spa. And he's he has, you know, a full head of hair like a human would and a little handlebar

325
00:37:05,617 --> 00:37:10,801
mustache, a very long mute and kind of some floppy ears like a dog. But even

326
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:14,769
even that, you get the feeling that, like, this

327
00:37:15,429 --> 00:37:16,807
man is considered

328
00:37:17,226 --> 00:37:18,965
handsome. He is handsome,

329
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:19,804
and

330
00:37:20,183 --> 00:37:24,212
he is... He has a presence to him. He is

331
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:25,568
very masculine,

332
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:27,483
but dog.

333
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,641
Right. And and... Yeah. He has that little, like, half warm smile and then

334
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:35,191
and she has

335
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:37,223
an old traditional

336
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:39,351
Spanish head covering

337
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:56,100
that you can tell is very old fashioned at that point, but that's who she is and then you have Tina, the quote unquote in and service. And I can I just say, I want Tina to give me a hug. I bet she gives the best

338
00:37:56,414 --> 00:37:57,753
and then you have Pan

339
00:37:58,212 --> 00:38:14,879
who is wearing a a big Spanish rose in her hair and and and her hair is long and and black with that little little line of blue that marks that it's shiny right how black hair shines in comments. And then in the background you have

340
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,559
and he's you see a silhouette of him on a horse,

341
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:23,802
lace wing of full with these really long dangerous ones.

342
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,015
This is art. This is a masterpiece,

343
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:28,931
and they're all animals

344
00:38:30,004 --> 00:38:55,749
Yeah. I will never get over how good Karl Barks is giving human traits to animals and giving animal traits to humans and vice versa. Right? Like, both of these, he is an expert at. Yeah. Very well sad. This is a stunning panel at sets up so much. I only my only complain is that it's not bigger, you know? This should have been like a a half page or a full page panel. I can just see it as Al d

345
00:38:56,049 --> 00:39:14,439
like, the credits, like, like, zooming in on each space as they travel across the screen. Yeah. It it looks like a play bill. You know. There's been a couple of nice covers adaptive out of this panel. And for the rest of for much of the rest of the story, you know, we just get to kind of live

346
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:17,151
alongside these people and we get to

347
00:39:17,807 --> 00:39:19,384
learn about the dynamic

348
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:33,758
between them. And and we find out that, you know, the Ron show is in the process of the rodeo, which is the roundup up of the wild cattle. We we learn about the cattle trade, we learn we see that the la

349
00:39:34,494 --> 00:39:37,960
are doing what they do rounding up stray.

350
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:40,752
We get to see Roland

351
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:44,288
finally, who who is arguably the hero. Right?

352
00:39:45,087 --> 00:39:55,351
Right. And car... And Carl Barks trains like a hero's camera on him. Right? We we get to see him at his at his job just being

353
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,190
spectacular

354
00:39:56,985 --> 00:40:01,845
And then the the Ducktales compare him to a famous modern day cowboy. Gene.

355
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:15,882
And so we're in the know that the Ducktales are thinking about all these to them modern western that now feel very antiquated. And then we get our little moment of peril where a bull heads straight for Pan.

356
00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:19,249
And the Ducktales and pan to all have to flee.

357
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:25,826
And and Pan chi gets thrown from her horse when he when it steps in a go for hole.

358
00:40:26,443 --> 00:40:33,863
And and we've got Donald trying to save the day. He gets it up to a little bit of buff getting pulled behind the bowl. But ultimately,

359
00:40:34,758 --> 00:40:39,998
orlando ends up rescuing her and donald. And donald the yes.

360
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:44,290
And it's a great setup that we we can see that Pan

361
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,330
is

362
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,970
sm with Roland

363
00:40:47,430 --> 00:41:00,230
and he's that sort of silent cowboy type. He clearly feels the same way about her. And and the nephews here, it's very cute. Tell me about the Nephews Sarah. They're often in the corner, The panel has

364
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:06,990
a a bowl with stars coming out of its its head. Like, it's, you know, ben subdued and

365
00:41:07,705 --> 00:41:08,205
twenty.

366
00:41:09,142 --> 00:41:23,394
Oh. No. I think you are wonderful. And he's just like, he's just got the little lines of emotion coming out. Like you said this strong silent type. And in the background, there's donald kind of knocked out but safe and the little boys are like

367
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:36,497
it's just like in the movies only nicer, and they a little Barks coming out of their head. They're so in love with the love that they're seeing in this scene. It's interesting for us to be the spectators

368
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:49,871
of something that the Ducktales spectators have too yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And it's interesting to see them in this, like, romantic mold when he'll usually make them you know, little boys who think Love is ic.

369
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:57,400
Al well this is what we need. It's very cute. It's It's a romance. It's it's such a

370
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:07,560
such an odd. We've got this... We've got this little romance novel here. And so we transitioned that evening to kind of a typical night with the Vac volcanoes

371
00:42:07,897 --> 00:42:08,397
singing

372
00:42:08,815 --> 00:42:11,726
at the cam campfire. It's a very funny little song.

373
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:13,438
Total hugo.

374
00:42:15,692 --> 00:42:20,502
And and we're made to know that Roland has the finest of all the singing voices

375
00:42:20,854 --> 00:42:31,449
And the the worst of all the jaws. Oh yeah this. Again, he is... He immediately stands out as, like, movie star handsome despite being a dog, and Pan

376
00:42:31,945 --> 00:42:35,833
is just stunning beautiful despite being a dog character.

377
00:42:36,344 --> 00:42:43,858
She looks ninety nine percent human in this. He he made them as human as he possibly could. And we get this funny moment

378
00:42:44,171 --> 00:42:53,086
and touching moment where Donald offers to teach him a new cowboy song and he kind of he kinda looks a little bit

379
00:42:53,586 --> 00:42:59,245
shy and says, you know, maybe there's someone that would like to hear me sing them referring, of course to Pan.

380
00:42:59,665 --> 00:43:01,779
And that look, is so

381
00:43:02,198 --> 00:43:03,457
worthy. U.

382
00:43:05,114 --> 00:43:11,080
If like, that's the kind of, like modern day, boy Barks. Like, Oh,

383
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:34,350
shy. I'm bash, but I'm also. Very hands and he was putting this look on dogs in the nineteen fifties. He was really ahead of his time. Right? Yeah. Because he's, like, he is that sort of boy or again, it's that like, back then this would have been the sensitive cowboy trope where he's he's tough and he can handle himself, he's sweet and shy, and has a lovely singing voice. Yeah

384
00:43:34,807 --> 00:43:51,140
this this story more than most really feels like it is geared towards a more female readers to me. You know, it has... It has something for everybody. Right? It has. It has the... It has the nostalgia for the older man. It has the

385
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,020
the dreamy romance

386
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,260
and the the the bash

387
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:04,309
strong silent hero for the boy like, and it has the kids on Al adventure for the...

388
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:14,520
And and you're on the adventure with them. It just it has something for everybody. Right? And and we're about to get this scene where they are gonna have a big

389
00:44:15,275 --> 00:44:17,775
to to finish the rodeo the Rodeo.

390
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:18,735
And

391
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:27,855
this is part of what makes me think that. Right? Because the the amount of detail that he pays with the the dresses and the suits is

392
00:44:28,193 --> 00:44:29,451
something that you would

393
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:33,265
associate with, like a period piece that is stereo

394
00:44:34,045 --> 00:44:59,140
more for women. Right? Like again, it's something anyone can enjoy. But the stereotype is that his boy readers probably wouldn't have been the the people who would have cared about him making these lovely dresses. And so forth. And and boy, the the banquet, the Fiesta is really something to see. He says guests come from leagues away. Fran shadows, vac volcanoes, Pad, Indians, cabal,

395
00:45:00,116 --> 00:45:03,091
It's very poetic. We see all of these

396
00:45:03,445 --> 00:45:08,305
people and we get introduced on the next page to the the pretty senior

397
00:45:08,965 --> 00:45:25,339
coming and he tells us that Pan is the prettiest of all. And we get again the Nephews this audience surrogate. They're very excited to see her and they're looking around for long though because they wanna see him ask her to dance the And. And then

398
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:27,956
we meet the monkey ranch.

399
00:45:28,355 --> 00:45:28,855
We

400
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:30,108
through the Nephews

401
00:45:30,803 --> 00:45:35,528
are outraged to see a man who is named Dawn H,

402
00:45:36,702 --> 00:45:41,720
a rich runs Run that the Sen order has chosen to be Pan

403
00:45:42,097 --> 00:45:45,280
husband. And he is a pig. He

404
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,280
is

405
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,920
not conventionally

406
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,280
attractive. He looks older.

407
00:45:50,580 --> 00:46:03,089
And she's bow her head because she is very clearly just not into him. To... She's she's sad about having to give the first dance to him. Right. And to be

408
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:12,760
engaged the truth to him. And then nephews are very upset as audience surrogate they they're thinking now things were too perfect

409
00:46:13,592 --> 00:46:18,856
this dawn Barks del la, I believe this might be the first appearance of Carl Barks,

410
00:46:19,574 --> 00:46:22,760
pig faced Villain. He will use this

411
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:28,080
archetype and a lot of comics spilling forward. He's like a tier two villain

412
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:57,389
going forward. He's he gets named at some point, I think Argus mixed swine and he never, like rises to the level of villain of, like, the beagle boys and Fun Long and Magic des spell who are Barks most famous villains, but when Barks doesn't wanna use someone else, and he just needs kind of a generic shifty person. He's gonna use this pig face to villain archetype. And so, you know, the nephews are of course outraged. They're talking to tina

413
00:46:58,126 --> 00:47:12,247
about white roland can't marry Pan chi. And she says that, you know, daughters of the grand d's do not marry poor vac. So we've got this little class element here. This is this is set up as something that that that we can't

414
00:47:12,586 --> 00:47:12,825
overcome it.

415
00:47:13,558 --> 00:47:15,494
Without overcoming the class difference.

416
00:47:15,952 --> 00:47:20,642
This next page is so lovely. It's more of this beautiful fiesta fiesta

417
00:47:21,234 --> 00:47:24,504
Sarah, do you notice how little the ducks appear here?

418
00:47:25,182 --> 00:47:37,671
On you're right. You're right, only in the very first and the very last panel does even Donald appear. Yeah. It's this is really all about On trying to get the nerve to ask Pan

419
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:38,885
or a dance

420
00:47:39,464 --> 00:47:43,259
he even reaches for a spur as though he's gonna whack him with the spur.

421
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:45,078
And Pan

422
00:47:45,577 --> 00:47:49,207
is grateful to don though for having given him

423
00:47:49,545 --> 00:47:54,115
the the kick because of course, she feels the same way about him.

424
00:47:54,453 --> 00:47:59,398
And we have this funny bit do you wanna tell us about the the funny little bit here with the music?

425
00:47:59,816 --> 00:48:07,834
I don't know if this is a real song or not, but it has words that would not make sense at all. To anybody in the eighteen

426
00:48:08,212 --> 00:48:20,096
forties, but it's you'd be a pip on my radar a while on the video we could sing beep up in a helicopter on our way to movie show, and he's singing this tour her

427
00:48:20,449 --> 00:48:25,145
she says the words don't make any sense Orlando. But sleep are more

428
00:48:25,484 --> 00:48:41,300
because she loves him. Obviously, this is a song that Donald taught him to sing to her. It's just such cute moment between... First before that, they are dancing and and you can see how beautifully the the layers of Pan

429
00:48:42,120 --> 00:49:00,457
skirt are are kind of drifting up Al as she's being thrown around the dance floor. It's just... And their faces are turned to each other. They're looking at each other. They're both very engaged and happy and you could just feel the love between these two cartoon

430
00:49:00,954 --> 00:49:01,632
human dogs.

431
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:02,350
Yeah.

432
00:49:03,203 --> 00:49:03,703
Absolutely.

433
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:22,035
It's very romantic. Know. It's so cute. It's it's very surface level because we we have to use all this short hands to, like, make clear their feeling. So this has happened very quickly of course, but I do feel very very engaged and very invested in this romance.

434
00:49:22,455 --> 00:49:29,635
I don't feel like this has happened very quickly. If you are familiar with the trope, didn't you

435
00:49:29,975 --> 00:49:35,165
watch princess bride or these kinds of kinds of relationship

436
00:49:36,183 --> 00:49:43,883
between the hired hand and the young daughter of the manor did fill up over months and sometimes years.

437
00:49:44,341 --> 00:49:46,850
That's true. We're we're meant to

438
00:49:47,269 --> 00:50:02,466
know that there's been a lot before this. It's it's very sweet. It's lovely. And again the detail in drawing her dress. And the artist three of her dress is very noteworthy for this boys comic. And this scars

439
00:50:02,804 --> 00:50:11,910
as well. Yeah. And then we've got know, we've got this little moment where the Dawn is sc her for making eyes

440
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:26,200
roland orlando, but Dawn Port del lard is so confident of his station and the agreement that he he's not even bothered and he says to let the hired man sing his silly songs. He'll sing a different tune at my wedding.

441
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:42,719
And then, you know, we've got this moment at the end where we meet another gas to day. Which I think is a property owner who is on his way to monte and he mentions offhand that he room and his coach for four. And,

442
00:50:43,098 --> 00:50:46,894
you know, Donald likes this idea because they really are just on vacation.

443
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:52,324
Why not. So the next morning, they get ready to hop in the coach.

444
00:50:52,902 --> 00:51:09,971
I'll say, Sarah that does really sound lovely riding through Ancient California and an old stage coach. I'm I'm sure it would get tiring and my butt would get sore after a few hours. But I think that I would would agree with you on that. You know, my butt would hurt, but it would be lovely.

445
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,469
Right. And I'm sure the Al

446
00:51:12,308 --> 00:51:13,706
has some pretty good upholstery.

447
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:20,060
And so, you know, the nephews are on board, but they they wanna see to roland orlando and Pan

448
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,440
before they leave.

449
00:51:22,254 --> 00:51:33,422
They're just talking about how the situation it ain't right. And Donald like you habit, but that's none of our business, but then he has a thought. And he asked tina, what year they're in.

450
00:51:34,557 --> 00:52:04,805
I love her response. She's like eighteen forty eight. My goodness, you're dumb. And you know, if you are a Californian and you know your history or you're familiar with the football team, the forty nine, you know what it means that they're in eighteen forty eight. The the ducks are so excited because they they know that they've got this solution to make orlando rich. And they convey the message that he should ride the hills beyond Sacramento with a gold pan, because he'll make it just before the gold rush.

451
00:52:05,698 --> 00:52:19,824
The don, you know, she soften her heart a bit. She she agrees that yes if he's rich, he could marry her and gives him a kiss and Pan gives them a kiss and of course, the nephews lineup up to get a kiss from Pan.

452
00:52:20,441 --> 00:52:26,827
Which feels kind of gross that one didn't sit well with me. Yeah. I I think I read that very.

453
00:52:27,245 --> 00:52:29,304
I think it's like, you know, just

454
00:52:29,763 --> 00:52:35,667
to me, it looks red very innocent cute, but I'm not gonna be grad or reading of it. Yeah.

455
00:52:36,045 --> 00:52:42,580
And so we transitioned to the Al journey and they're talking about, you know, how rough the road is

456
00:52:43,439 --> 00:52:46,257
I may approach the city of Los angeles Hi

457
00:52:46,636 --> 00:52:48,854
soon, and the Ducktales are just

458
00:52:49,393 --> 00:53:02,505
stunned to see the tiny little village this is this is a great little reference for the modern reader. And this is what any Californian who's been there long enough. My my dad loves to rem about the

459
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:03,743
peach orchard

460
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,335
that were one block away from his

461
00:53:07,753 --> 00:53:10,585
my grandmother's house and down in Cup,

462
00:53:10,885 --> 00:53:17,625
which is now like, a couple blocks away from the Apple, the giant Apple building. So change

463
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:29,463
in in in Phoenix. Right? Like, oh, this used to be orange groves. Oh, across the street, we used to have cotton fields, and I remember them. But now for miles, we have thing that suburbs.

464
00:53:29,919 --> 00:53:54,131
Right. And it's en if you're not one of those people who who grew up there, and it's all you can think of if you did. Right. And this style called is a really nice man because as he gets to talking, he tells Don Donald that he really should be set up with some land he says he has a few small grants left and he just straight up offers Donald a few thousand acres of California

465
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:55,066
and Barks

466
00:53:55,918 --> 00:54:01,559
narration box highlights this. He says just like that, Donald becomes owner of a huge chunk of California.

467
00:54:03,585 --> 00:54:04,085
And

468
00:54:04,385 --> 00:54:07,805
I mean, this this is what happened with a lot of California.

469
00:54:08,105 --> 00:54:21,255
Right? Huge land grants given away to the right people and the wrong people quote unquote, and people would get chased off the land and and the land would get d up and marginalized people would get pushed to the outskirts

470
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:22,333
and

471
00:54:22,832 --> 00:54:26,688
it's so it's a pretty astonishing little little bit of fantasy

472
00:54:27,386 --> 00:54:43,905
and history. Yeah. And so, you know, the the Nephews, the Ducktales all celebrate that they're their big run now and they approach their giant tracts of land on foot. They hear some shooting and they encounter a very shifty looking man wrestling

473
00:54:44,365 --> 00:55:07,140
their cows for their hides. And they very un wisely go up to the man and tell him that, you know, we're the owners, we've got the deeds here and this guy is he's that guy that you referenced that's very like hill billie ish very he does what he's gonna do. He immediately comment here the ducks property. He takes it over. And his name is Es,

474
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:28,472
and the Docs just they're disappointed that they've lost their land, but I think in the back of their mind, they're like, well, this is just a dream. So I guess it's not the end of the world. It's it's totally pretty weird. Right? Too have been given this this giant tract of land and then immediately lose it. Oh, I looked up where it was. I was like, okay. Where exactly is the and joaquin valley.

475
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:31,484
What have they done with it now? It

476
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:43,234
it didn't really look that developed from right now. Suburbs are around it. Yeah. That's that's like the interior that's like scrub, not so productive, California.

477
00:55:43,653 --> 00:56:00,500
I mean, everything in Al gold plated these days but there are still parts of it that are less developed than others. And and so we've transitioned now. Right? We we headed from Southern California up to Northern California. So this is much more of a Southern California adventure,

478
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,351
but... But we do have this part again, California history,

479
00:56:04,768 --> 00:56:29,740
all about the gold rush. And they head up to sutter fort, and I don't know if sutter that name means much to you, Sarah. But as someone who... Yeah. If you if you went through fourth grade California history, you learned all about sutter for and Sutter minds, so many of the names and the terms are so familiar to me and this. You think that I've been white would have been more interested in this story given that But

480
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:47,201
but this isn't one that I went back to all that often. Is there a modern day analog to sutter sport, does it still exist? What what's going on with Sutter fort? Oh, yeah. Like it's... you know, it's a big tourist desk nation, you can go and you can pan for gold. You can

481
00:56:47,817 --> 00:56:48,836
see the sites

482
00:56:49,692 --> 00:57:01,186
as kids, we did this big, like week long field trip called cross country, California where we stayed Al like a summer camp and one of the stops was to I believe we saw some of the sutter

483
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,400
stuff. There's a whole little tourist

484
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:22,816
industry with the gold rush stuff. And who was sutter? Sutter himself is the guy who, likes set off the gold rush by by being the person to to first discover gold in eighteen forty eight. So the mill been, like, reconstructed, you know? So we we've arrived at outside of the gold rush. And

485
00:57:23,475 --> 00:57:29,304
they're very interested in this. They they've made plans to buy a gun to get their land back from.

486
00:57:30,043 --> 00:57:33,660
And Donald leaves the kids so that he can go do that. And

487
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:40,590
pledges that he's not gonna be overwhelmed by gold fever. But of course, when he returns, he's got... He's got a prospect

488
00:57:40,971 --> 00:57:43,191
pack and he has allowed

489
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:54,806
the gold fever to overtake him. Which I mean, of the two, I think that that's a better choice to be c obsessed with. Sure. Yeah. Especially given that this is all a fever dream.

490
00:57:55,778 --> 00:58:15,687
So we transition to this being a gold rush tail and the the Ducktales have some pretty spectacular luck they got a a amount of nuggets that would be just worth a fantastic amount of money back then. This is more than any prospect through whatever hope to find. But we see another prospect

491
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:28,951
approach behind them, and he's gonna pull a con on them. He says you young dig that kind of stuff. You must be green. He characterize that as only eighteen carat gold. And he tells them where they can find some twenty two care gold

492
00:58:29,328 --> 00:58:39,929
around the band. And when they when they foolishly run around the band, they realized that the the man has claim jumps them. Which like I you really get into these

493
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:46,110
details about the history. Right? Like, you don't just... Oh, and then people claim up each other. He

494
00:58:46,846 --> 00:58:47,200
illustrates

495
00:58:47,938 --> 00:59:01,332
how claim jumping works. Yeah. I didn't. I didn't know that. I I learned from this. I learned a lot from this one. Nice. And and then on the next page we learned that this man not only has this shift

496
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:05,357
claim jumper taken their gold but he is also

497
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,787
partnered with,

498
00:59:07,786 --> 00:59:25,780
their old friend, who has heard claim jumping is richer than land jumping And and so, you know, the ducks are in a spot of trouble here because they're being menace by ezra with his gun, and then heroic just in the nick of time, and and we only see him by his silhouette first roland

499
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:31,420
comes to the Ducktales rescue. And he is just the the movie star hero

500
00:59:31,800 --> 01:00:05,034
the nephew calls him just as big and rough as ever. It takes both men down ezra and the claim jumper and that's pretty tough. Yeah. And so the Ducktales continue now to work their Al claim and they've got the... They've got On to protect them, the quote best air in the hills i'm so they mine a fortune out of this claim, and it's very sweet. Right? It's a nice little ending, Donald says there's gold enough for us Al. And Roland orlando says for Pan, the finest ranch show in all of California

501
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:08,645
and they they warm part ways,

502
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:19,380
leaves, Laden with gold. And the story takes this with full turn as they watch him walk away, and they comment that Don Gasp and the Sen and Pan

503
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:25,590
they seems so far away now or something like people we read about in an old old book. And,

504
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:31,038
you know, they they decide that they need to take an nap. And we finally see the landscape

505
01:00:31,616 --> 01:00:37,903
dissolve away, and and we finally see the the Ducktales coming to Do you wanna to tell us about

506
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:47,138
this seen here, sarah. The... It's clear that they... The four of them across three beds are stirring and there's a nurse in the typical

507
01:00:47,635 --> 01:00:48,614
nineteen fifties

508
01:00:49,151 --> 01:00:53,095
dress with a with the white nursing hat calling the dock

509
01:00:53,793 --> 01:01:11,005
saying that they're coming to and the doctor explains to them what happened. You know, you're in a hospital. Don't you remember your your car struck or rock? And some indians trek to doctor you with dancing in herbs. And Donald like oh, you're not sure. The medicine man.

510
01:01:11,582 --> 01:01:27,623
And then the doctor says, you must have given you some powerful stuff you've been in A coma six weeks. And, of course, Donald is just shocked at that news. Yeah. There there was no great way to transition out of this like, time travel tale that didn't involve time travel.

511
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:28,814
So Barks

512
01:01:29,373 --> 01:01:35,640
told the story that he wanted to. He wanted this to be in a dream like state. So he did it. And and it doesn't

513
01:01:36,019 --> 01:01:42,232
work perfectly for me, but it works alright. Because that's not the point of the story. Right? The point of the story is the west

514
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:46,871
and the nostalgia. I could done without the herbs causing

515
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:50,235
it. It could just been a headwind wound. Yeah.

516
01:01:50,809 --> 01:01:51,628
I have that.

517
01:01:52,085 --> 01:01:57,891
Once you bring in like, oh, it's been six weeks. Like, that makes it sounds like poisoning

518
01:01:58,483 --> 01:02:33,034
and it... you know, even if their intentions were good, it still is pretty nefarious to put somebody in a coma for six weeks Yeah. I I agree. That part of the story is a little uncomfortable. I remember that it always kind of quiet me. I didn't read this one as as frequently as I did others as a kid and so my memory of it wasn't a sharp because it had been a good twenty years. Since I read this and I was like, oh, I think I remember, don't they like get into a horrible car accident and they go into a coma, and then some Indians bring them out of the coma

519
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:37,182
because I think my mind preferred that scenario or something.

520
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:54,656
And so, you know, the ducks are on their way. They recover quickly from their coma at this point, we've got it's lamps shaded by saying modern medicine and modern garages have their points and the ducks are soon on their way. And as they drive off, they pass the old rancho show in a very d

521
01:02:55,072 --> 01:02:55,931
state And

522
01:02:56,427 --> 01:02:59,890
the Ducktales very acutely decide to sing a serena

523
01:03:00,467 --> 01:03:06,386
to them in the manner that they had originally greeted them that like little awkward cringey,

524
01:03:06,882 --> 01:03:18,788
singing and dance seen that they did. And it's a very poetic ending. I'll just read the narrator box says so once again, Donald and the kids come up the path to the old ranch house. And as they sing,

525
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,859
we see a new panel with a couple of other Californian

526
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:40,360
and it says and behind them, new California goes by and the the two drivers are commenting on some some kids singing Spanish songs in front of the old shack and the man says you see the nut people in these sticks So what do you think of the ending there, Sarah? It felt

527
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:42,552
like it was very

528
01:03:42,929 --> 01:03:44,146
abrupt. Mh.

529
01:03:44,523 --> 01:03:46,675
I would liked to see a wedding.

530
01:03:47,895 --> 01:03:50,495
That would have brought me the resolution that I needed.

531
01:03:50,935 --> 01:03:55,770
Because as you said, it did become a story about

532
01:03:56,070 --> 01:04:10,576
the rancher for a while Instead of a story about the ducks. Right. Yeah. That would have been neat. You know, his longest stories were thirty two pager. If he had had another another four pages or even just one page that just highlighted

533
01:04:11,728 --> 01:04:15,617
Roland orlando as he arrived back to greet Pan.

534
01:04:16,273 --> 01:04:21,455
But again, maybe that is an indication that ultimately this is a book for little boys

535
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:28,829
instead of four little boys and else. All stories are for everybody Barks. I fully agree. But

536
01:04:29,287 --> 01:04:31,263
but I do you know

537
01:04:31,920 --> 01:05:13,422
I do know what Barks was probably thinking when he wrote these. Right. I mean, there were points where they really did make an effort to to be expansive. But I think they did the thing that one usually does. By telling a story for boys, boys are considered the default and so you've just made a story for everyone. Right. Right. Right. I think it would been a really good way to end this story with some symmetry. If they did go back with Roland to the ranch. Have a wedding scene, go back and visit the Indians and then wake up in the hospital. Yeah. There'll be some nice symmetry there. I think it would have been neat to see some almost like spectral versions

538
01:05:13,879 --> 01:05:14,977
of the

539
01:05:15,395 --> 01:05:18,386
the people of the run shadow having the wedding.

540
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,420
As.

541
01:05:20,477 --> 01:05:22,735
Oh, you just gave me goosebumps. Yeah.

542
01:05:23,992 --> 01:05:30,370
Because you could've you coulda have done it both in one. Like, maybe we didn't need that little throw a panel of the

543
01:05:30,747 --> 01:05:31,806
Goof ball Californian

544
01:05:32,382 --> 01:05:42,706
maybe that could have been the wedding party. Oh, that would have been so good. So much better than my idea. Regardless, it's it's a lovely little story. I totally

545
01:05:43,044 --> 01:05:57,577
understand why people love this one. You know, it's it stands out and people are gonna remember out of the, like scores and scores of stories he did. Some of them really stand out as distinct. Right? Dangerous

546
01:05:58,034 --> 01:06:04,180
disguise is as unique for the reasons that it's unique. Voodoo hut was was unique,

547
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:07,070
say what you will, but it was a very horrific

548
01:06:07,728 --> 01:06:14,265
unforgettable story. And this one just stands apart as like his most nostalgic and romantic

549
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:20,690
story. So I get like people love this one. What do you think? I always... When you tell me what ratings,

550
01:06:21,027 --> 01:06:31,091
some of the stories have gotten. I'm always kind of shocked and a little bit dis dismay. Because you do tend to bring me on for the heavier more problematic

551
01:06:31,525 --> 01:06:34,225
stuff. And I a lot of them

552
01:06:34,605 --> 01:06:43,576
score so highly. And so the ones that that we read that are just just as fine today as they would have been, you know,

553
01:06:44,495 --> 01:07:05,825
back then. Tend to not in my limited experience. Would you say that that's accurate? Yeah. I mean, you're getting such a like weird variety of them. Right? Because I've I've had on for a number of these. But but he has a ton of stories. So I might have to just pick a few like I might have to think about what is a good

554
01:07:06,805 --> 01:07:15,797
representation of these overall? I'll think about like Right. Six or eight, you know, must reads to make sure that you've got a rounded picture.

555
01:07:16,136 --> 01:07:19,472
I know I don't have a rounded picture. Yeah. But it also

556
01:07:20,011 --> 01:07:23,719
does feel like so many of the ones that I've read

557
01:07:24,096 --> 01:07:28,145
specifically so I can help process the problem like problematic elements

558
01:07:28,881 --> 01:07:30,796
score dis dismay high.

559
01:07:31,409 --> 01:07:41,025
But for this one, I can see how it's scored so high. Right? Like, the people that have read it very... you know, not everybody has my sensitivity,

560
01:07:41,485 --> 01:07:57,105
so they're not gonna have the problems with it that I have. And I I understand that about humans, and I can see how this one would appeal to humans and, you know, I talk about them like they're separate species. Right. Right. Like, we're a robot study in. Like

561
01:07:57,923 --> 01:08:09,295
like I'm a aroma studying them, exactly. What do you think? Does this one get... Do you think this one gets a little bit credit for trying hard or is that not enough? I think with

562
01:08:09,834 --> 01:08:10,334
today's

563
01:08:10,793 --> 01:08:11,293
sensibilities,

564
01:08:12,032 --> 01:08:19,446
no. Absolutely not. And thought leaders will point to this is how this damaged

565
01:08:19,822 --> 01:08:20,322
relationships

566
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:29,485
between Native America this specific thing it has caused this damage. And they can point to ways that even these

567
01:08:29,984 --> 01:08:30,484
slightly

568
01:08:31,021 --> 01:08:31,521
better

569
01:08:32,178 --> 01:08:34,174
representations are still extremely harmful.

570
01:08:34,613 --> 01:08:37,760
I think from well he was

571
01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:45,983
trying and maybe doing the best he could at the time. I think it's better than

572
01:08:46,321 --> 01:08:46,635
not

573
01:08:47,175 --> 01:08:52,355
trying, but we can still see the effects of the harm that such per

574
01:08:53,215 --> 01:08:57,530
has caused So I wouldn't credit him with being

575
01:08:58,110 --> 01:09:15,770
progressive even for his time, but I can recognize that this was progressive his time. Recognize the effort. It doesn't mean it doesn't mean it worked. Right. Yeah. I... That's important to recognize Right? Because even even well meaning, quote, like positive stereotypes

576
01:09:16,228 --> 01:09:29,258
can still be harmful. How about the story itself? You know we both had some really positive things to say about it. Right? What do you... What's your overall impression? I really liked it. I really thought it was cute. I really liked it. I was shipping

577
01:09:29,636 --> 01:09:30,696
pan and.

578
01:09:31,635 --> 01:09:32,334
Oh, yeah.

579
01:09:32,753 --> 01:09:35,490
I I loved that the boys

580
01:09:35,844 --> 01:09:40,734
just kinda got to go on Al adventure instead of be the adult in a situation.

581
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:49,899
True. I I did I did enjoy it aside from the. I think you could have taken out the native American people

582
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:50,739
completely.

583
01:09:51,215 --> 01:09:51,995
That whole...

584
01:09:52,455 --> 01:10:01,877
They they didn't even need to be there. You could have had the exact same story with head wounds. Yeah. I agree. It feels like he wanted to have them

585
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:13,490
because of the, like, the fact that Rum ramona is it's it's so central to Am ramona. But I I feel like we lose... You know, he never goes plays with Ramona

586
01:10:14,148 --> 01:10:31,786
seat where Pan should have at some point been identified as having been part native I don't see her as being coded that way. At any point. Right? She... To me she was Spanish, not mexican... Especially because we see both of her parents. Right. And they're very clearly Spanish.

587
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,500
Right. I do read Roland,

588
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,500
though as Me.

589
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,340
I did see him as either a mexican

590
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,900
or a mixed character.

591
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:51,866
So... I could see that. That that was my reading of it. I don't think I'm stretching. I... Because, you know, we we have the, like, class element of it. And that that matches. Right? He's a.

592
01:10:52,425 --> 01:11:06,849
And and I did like Tina, you know, she she can stay But the the tribe I think, you know, it's it's not great that she's quote just a servant, but it is true to life, unfortunately. Mh. But I liked her. I thought she was like.

593
01:11:07,506 --> 01:11:26,710
I want her to give me hugs. Yeah. And I thought it was refreshing that, like, a fat character wasn't played for she wasn't she's very she's very large, but she's also not... It's not played for laughs. And she's she's so maternal. And she's allowed to have a sense of

594
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:55,220
control over the situation. Right? You get the feeling that she runs. The the show. Like, the inside of it. Yeah. So... yeah. I think... I think this a really lovely story. I've been pretty clear that it's like it's not one of my favorite. Like, I don't go back to this one all the time, but I do feel like it's one that I can appreciate much more as an adult. Than I can as a kid. Because I'm seeing... I'm seeing the detail that he... Yeah. I'm just I'm seeing the attention of detail that he paid with

595
01:11:55,997 --> 01:12:02,394
elements that wouldn't have interested me as a kid. Like, how lovely everything at the Fiesta looked, the romance.

596
01:12:03,025 --> 01:12:16,348
You know, it wasn't what I was about as a nine than ten year old. Right. Is there a practice of families reading these together? Like, a mother and a son maybe that maybe back then this would have been

597
01:12:16,686 --> 01:12:17,745
geared toward

598
01:12:18,082 --> 01:12:51,140
more of that than individual reading. I think that the expectation back then for comics is that they were just kids. Right. You you read him. You were a kid. He was writing them for kids. I I think he wrote and Drew what he thought he would enjoy. And he pointed tried never to talk down to kids. Like, that's something that really comes out and that he has said. A lot of fans, of course grew up reading these to their children. You know, I've read, I've read these to my own kids. I love reading them to my kids. No one ever read them too or with me,

599
01:12:51,480 --> 01:13:21,289
but, you know, I just I've discovered them for myself at the news stand. But, yeah, this one seems like one that that parent could enjoy more than many reading to their kids. Yeah. It seems like it has several layers. It it seems like the first one that's written at that kind of a level two appeal to adele. Adults. Right? It has the romance. It has the nostalgia. And it's not just a history lesson. It is nostalgia. It is very nostalgic. It's very wi.

600
01:13:21,705 --> 01:13:33,748
And I think what you're hitting on is that he really wrote it for himself. You know, this is obviously like a very personal one. You know? He likes to draw these more human characters in these more human

601
01:13:34,087 --> 01:13:34,486
situations.

602
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:48,768
So everyone in while he steered that where he thought he could go with it. And yeah. I think he had a great time doing this. Any other thoughts or I can transition into talking about the consensus? Of course, the kind of Ana socialist

603
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:58,835
anti capitalist in the thought that the the class struggle being solved by just giving Al chance to make money was

604
01:13:59,413 --> 01:13:59,913
hilarious

605
01:14:00,289 --> 01:14:03,817
because it felt like he was able to buy Pan.

606
01:14:04,154 --> 01:14:10,849
Obviously, she was a willing participant in this but because money was so central to it. My notes say,

607
01:14:11,386 --> 01:14:15,891
everyone gets rich and Romano has enough to buy or afford to Mary, but

608
01:14:17,307 --> 01:14:31,281
Yeah. It's true. And people who tell you money can't solve your problems are wrong. Right? Like, You're wrong. Ninety nine out of a hundred times. People's problems have to do with the lack of money. So this feels like a very good highlighting of that.

609
01:14:32,014 --> 01:14:36,870
You know what I just remember. I didn't comment on how much I liked seeing Pan

610
01:14:37,329 --> 01:14:44,840
out at the rodeo. You know? She was like dressed for it. She was obviously a very capable writer.

611
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:51,054
She looked awesome. Right? She she had multiple outfits throughout the course of this. But

612
01:14:51,751 --> 01:14:53,226
she didn't do anything wrong.

613
01:14:53,904 --> 01:15:02,394
It it was her horse that stumbled in a go for hole. You know. She... Like, she still needed to be saved. Yes. Because that's the old, like, hollywood

614
01:15:02,771 --> 01:15:15,045
archetype. But I do like that she he really went out of his way to present her as very capable. She right. She's wearing a pants suit. She's wearing spur. And yeah,

615
01:15:15,605 --> 01:15:19,116
she she didn't fall off her horse because she's

616
01:15:19,493 --> 01:15:19,993
incapable.

617
01:15:20,371 --> 01:15:22,706
It was just a an accident.

618
01:15:23,084 --> 01:15:40,680
Yeah. And and again, she looks great. Almost as good as she does in her beautiful dress. I mean, chances are coming back around. So I would say that Yeah. She looks really great. And it's gorgeous. It's still very feminine, but also, you know, we have this stereotype

619
01:15:41,021 --> 01:15:54,389
of you know, women could wet ride horses, but they had to ride side saddle she gets pants no problem. I know it. Look at her in the panel where her horse rear as the bowl coming. I mean, she's

620
01:15:54,728 --> 01:15:57,662
steady as a rock. Oh, yeah. That's an excellent

621
01:15:58,176 --> 01:16:07,161
thing to notice mark. Holding the horse with one rain pointing back over her shoulder. Yeah. I really like that. I really like I found Pan

622
01:16:07,581 --> 01:16:08,081
and

623
01:16:09,061 --> 01:16:09,561
Delightful.

624
01:16:10,021 --> 01:16:23,126
Mh. So I've mentioned, you know, a few times that the community loves this one it is rated super high on index currently and likely forever. It has a rating of seven out of all forty thousand.

625
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:38,789
Some stories. That's good for eight point five out of ten. I like it. I think it's great. I guess it is like, if I think about what the all time classic Donald dot stories. This this has gotta be a top ten. Out of all the Donald Ducktales adventures.

626
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:54,682
Probably wouldn't... If I thought about the Donald man Scrooge stories. I don't think I'd have it in the overall top ten or twenty. But it is a great story. It holds up. I mean, as a story it holds up very well, there's obvious some very dated elements of it that that don't work

627
01:16:55,021 --> 01:16:57,879
It it presents this weird, like, fantasy

628
01:16:58,817 --> 01:16:59,317
utopian

629
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:01,450
version. Of old California

630
01:17:01,829 --> 01:17:13,550
that was was not a thing. But it was a really interesting look back at the past. It it got some stuff right. And then some stuff it completely muddled up, of course. It is still a funny animal chronic.

631
01:17:14,988 --> 01:17:25,803
Four children. Yeah. Yes. But a very ind one. I think we've covered a lot. So, you know, we can we can close out by by talking about if there are any any

632
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:26,642
panels

633
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:32,656
among the many wonderful panels in this story that do stand out as your favorites.

634
01:17:32,956 --> 01:17:37,108
I already talked about the one introducing

635
01:17:37,647 --> 01:17:38,467
the family.

636
01:17:38,806 --> 01:17:42,781
Right. But I want to also draw attention to

637
01:17:43,256 --> 01:17:48,031
the first introduction of the rodeo after the kids are being carried off into

638
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:54,835
a to a bath. It just makes me kind of, like, whisper fall for home. Right. There's a sag

639
01:17:55,331 --> 01:18:00,417
so that's not quite geographically accurate, but back home, we had.

640
01:18:01,392 --> 01:18:09,986
Oh, yes. So I'm nostalgic or for home because of this panel. And it's really great. It... You know, it has a rolling hills

641
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:17,100
donald writing a horse himself. I like that panel. And now I have to say that the panel with Pan

642
01:18:17,557 --> 01:18:31,571
riding a horse that's rear that. That's now about my favorites now that you've pointed it out. Oh, I'm glad to hear it. Yeah. It is a good one. I have to echo what you said about the play bill, you know, the the poster for the Tele,

643
01:18:31,908 --> 01:18:34,402
basically. That's so awesome. And there's so much

644
01:18:34,739 --> 01:18:41,991
characterization there. And you could almost just pick any of the great panels from the the Rodeo

645
01:18:42,328 --> 01:18:45,556
or the fiesta fiesta because they're all just so gorgeous.

646
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:48,029
I do like the pile of bowls.

647
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:57,194
And I do like the old the the introduction to the old on show, how we see it both in its new state and old and d.

648
01:18:57,892 --> 01:18:58,392
And

649
01:18:58,731 --> 01:19:05,491
just those piano panels that echo each other, you know, in the past and and in the present are really cool.

650
01:19:06,528 --> 01:19:07,844
Let's see. And then, you know,

651
01:19:08,801 --> 01:19:21,561
specifically, I love her ruffled dress during the fiesta. When you can see all that detail and and his his outfit as well. Looks awesome. So yeah, thank you so much for talking with me about old California.

652
01:19:22,021 --> 01:19:31,135
We're gonna get to follow up our awesome podcast where we joined Warren Harmon and or you can't guess. We're gonna cover a Christmas for Shack,

653
01:19:31,593 --> 01:19:45,562
next episode. So I'm very excited to hear what you have to say about about that one. And listeners can let us know what they thought of our remarks and reach out to us on the Facebook page. And we'll look forward

654
01:19:45,955 --> 01:19:48,966
