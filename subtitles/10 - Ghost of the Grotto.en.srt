Hello, and welcome back to Barks remarks

3
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,371
everyone. I am still Barks Sever.

4
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:57,905
A grown man who has

5
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:04,205
managed to con some friends into letting him talk about his favorite comic stories.

6
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,796
In the guise of actually releasing it as a podcast.

7
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:16,197
Don't tell them, but at any rate, I am joined by my guess toast, Ryan, if you can say hi to good people?

8
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:20,184
Hello everyone. I'm Ryan Bailey. This is my voice and

9
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:22,315
I am easily influenced by my friends.

10
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:24,546
Well, yes. Definitely.

11
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:29,493
So Ryan, today, we get to talk about

12
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:34,925
a favorite comic of mine. I'm I'm very excited to get to this one.

13
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:38,765
I've been looking forward to it for a while. We will be covering Barks

14
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:42,197
ghost of the g. This is

15
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:51,648
an adventure story that was published in July of nineteen forty seven. In four color number one hundred and fifty nine,

16
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:55,217
it has of course been reprinted many times

17
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:58,181
This one is twenty six pages,

18
00:01:59,156 --> 00:01:59,656
and

19
00:02:00,312 --> 00:02:03,482
I I thought about it and I would like to start

20
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:04,414
asking

21
00:02:04,912 --> 00:02:07,448
you the c hosts to give us

22
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:09,005
your own synopsis

23
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:13,236
of the story since I do most of the

24
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,430
narration. So let's let's hear it. What how would you sum up ghost of the g?

25
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,569
So Donald in the nephews are

26
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,862
struggling to harvest health. And

27
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:32,415
in the process of that, they and hear Al legend of a kidnapping of a small boy that happens every fifty years

28
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,269
The ducks dismiss, of course and

29
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,709
later on and there harvesting happened upon a circular reef

30
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,450
inside which they hope is an untapped kelp forest.

31
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:47,253
Trying to get over the reef during high tide, they run a ground on it and discovered the sunken wreck of an ancient Al,

32
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,046
Al octopus Kaiju apparently lives inside the rec ship.

33
00:02:51,780 --> 00:03:00,800
Sure enough. Dewey is kidnapped by an Armored man in the night while they sleep on their boat. Donald and the other nephews find the armored kid who talks like a Shakespeare character

34
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:07,665
in a cavern inside the reef and engage in deadly ski to get dewey back or to signal for help from the town on the main island.

35
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:10,912
They overcome the octopus Kaiju and the Armored ban.

36
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:20,325
The armored man has revealed to be the latest in the line of boys kidnapped and raised by their kid kidnapping. To guard a chest of gold intended for her francis drake and her majesty.

37
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:27,526
Donald is given praise by the town on the island and the formerly armored man gets the ancient gold and some hamburgers.

38
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:29,643
Excellent.

39
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:31,601
Very capable synopsis.

40
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:36,374
I like that you referred to the Octopus as a Kaiju.

41
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:38,715
Tell us what Kaiju you is, please.

42
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:42,144
Ridiculously large monster, like Godzilla.

43
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:44,698
This is the octopus version of Godzilla.

44
00:03:45,196 --> 00:03:47,852
Yes the octopus version of Godzilla definitely.

45
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:51,305
That was great. Thank you very much.

46
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:52,144
So

47
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,704
a little bit of background

48
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:55,184
about this story

49
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:12,965
I I didn't check into this. But to me, it feels like Barks is kinda picking up his pace here because this was published just a couple of months after his previous pair of adventure stories. And this is gonna be another of those that has two full length adventures. Next episode we'll talk about adventure down under.

50
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:15,238
But this one gets the coveted

51
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:16,996
cover

52
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:20,312
for for this pair of stories for this issue.

53
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:22,884
There is a little bit of of

54
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:26,357
of detail in an interview that Barks did

55
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:31,645
about this one. So in in his words, he said that this story was a rare example,

56
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,751
of a tale that was conceived as a ten pager

57
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:37,201
for walt Disney's comics and stories,

58
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:38,857
the short

59
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:57,689
gag story publication. And it grew into a longer story for Donald Duck. He said, I can remember the first idea I had on that was just trying to figure out something Donald could do I thought of him sailing votes and came up with a potential ten pages of gathering seaweed and selling this kelp which would give me a lot of gaps with boats.

60
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:04,805
As I developed more and more things with the story. I think it's quite possible that the ghost of the g is brought in as a menace.

61
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:11,319
There is so much in that. I couldn't have thought of it in a whole bucket full of writing at once. And I I think that probably

62
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:19,105
bears out in the story Ryan because this one does seem like it is a little bit of a sequence of kind of improbable things that happen.

63
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:22,950
But but for me, this one just really works,

64
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:33,596
and that's gonna gonna stem from the underlying kind of mystery structure that he's gonna develop at the beginning of it. But before we get more into it, just a little more background

65
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:36,760
Barks was inspired as the often is by Al Ash

66
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:41,230
geographic article about treasure hunting in a ship rack.

67
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:51,355
The treasury salvage apparently cut a hole in the side. Like the one that the armored man exits from. And they they didn't find any treasure, but he was able to envision

68
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:53,175
this and kind of run with it.

69
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:59,430
I noted that this is one of his titles that has a nice use of all iteration. Barks

70
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,103
is gonna tend to do that a lot. In his stories going forward.

71
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:13,345
And the the very well known editor, Jeffrey Blu has called this one one of his landmark stories. I think that's because it kinda has that modest beginning

72
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:16,221
that sets up something much more

73
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,025
fan. As far as the value, this one, you know, we're in that area where these

74
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:38,579
reprint or the original printing rather go for quite a bit of money. So the highest documented sale was in very good condition for this one. It's nine point six was sold for seven thousand five hundred dollars And then, Ryan, you know that I I like to go into some sort of the

75
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:46,829
historical background or the geographical context for these stories. That's a big part of what interests me. So I want you to

76
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,389
buckle up for fifteen minutes

77
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:53,204
about kelp gathering. Oh, excellent. Yeah.

78
00:06:54,104 --> 00:07:09,874
No. I... I'm not gonna talk about that too much. But I I did I did look it up and I did find it really interesting to find out that, you know, this is a real thing. This apparently is where Iodine comes from. This is the easiest way to get today. Yes.

79
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,170
Apparently, this is still the easiest way to get like, commercial grade iodine.

80
00:07:15,748 --> 00:07:18,939
I happen to live near one of the one of the world's premier

81
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:25,719
aquariums where I learned that Kelp can grow a foot a day, had some nice. So

82
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:28,130
if if you wanna gather a crop, it's a good crop.

83
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,680
Yeah. So a little bit just a little bit on the history of that. Iodine

84
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:44,268
was first extracted from seaweed in eighteen eleven. This is something that gets used for a lot of different reasons, including treating some health conditions.

85
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:45,822
I also

86
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:55,465
actually thought about the title and wondered if people would know what a g is. Do you know the, like, true definition of Ag g Ryan? What can I do. I think of it as

87
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:19,240
like any kind of water cave? Yeah. That... That's right. Technically, it's much more expansive. It can be really any cave and I think the official definition says that it doesn't have to be you know, underwater or prop to water, but that's in practice. That is how we use it. We usually talk about, like caves that are just underwater or or right near nearby water.

88
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:21,867
So yes, the g itself,

89
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,225
of course is gonna be the underground hideout out of the Armored man.

90
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:35,670
So for notable appearances in this one. I've already named dropped to the Armored man. We don't ever learn his actual name. I don't believe.

91
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:45,225
There's no no one else other than the Ducktales that's really noteworthy in this one. I've started to talk about kind of what version of the characters

92
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:50,355
of the characters we're getting in these stories now. And to me, this is sort of the resourceful

93
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:54,530
version of Donald. You know, he's very level headed in this one for the most part.

94
00:08:55,345 --> 00:08:58,285
He's very determined once dewey he disappears

95
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:08,880
to get him back. you know, he he never really loses his head in this one, which is not very typical for donald. It's true. So we're gonna go over our

96
00:09:09,535 --> 00:09:11,724
re retailing of the story And

97
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,320
again, as always, Ryan, feel free to chime in. But

98
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:21,967
the... This story opens up with a really cool splash panel and an explanation of

99
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:34,325
summary of setting up where they are there. They're in the west indies and they have a boat. And as Ryan Al mentioned, they've got their own seaweed gathering business.

100
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,680
So the first page has them...

101
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,560
It shows sort of their day to day harvesting

102
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,580
kelp harvesting Seaweed.

103
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:51,615
And what I found notable about this is that Barks really... I think goes into some nice detail with the artwork. He shows us kind of the mechanics.

104
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:55,438
Of the kelp gathering with the win and the

105
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:59,801
the tongs or whatever the the pin that they use to harvest it.

106
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:24,408
And they're just talking about their business in general. They they've been talking about how the beds, the seaweed beds are playing out and they're getting less and less. And on their way back, they mentioned that there's a lot of Seaweed to be gathered in the center of skull Eye reef if they could only get to it. And so that kinda sets it up. They passed the reef. Ryan, How would you describe the reef??

107
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:27,260
It's it's pretty small. And

108
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:28,177
it's

109
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:34,532
perfect circle like a donut. So there's water in the center and water are all around it, and then it's just this

110
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:35,569
mound

111
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:37,780
that that goes all the way around unbroken.

112
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:45,610
Right. And they set it up so that whatever is in the middle of that, you know, you can't really access Al all and they know that there's a ton of kelp

113
00:10:46,230 --> 00:11:01,491
in the center. There's a really neat little site gag that Barks has of a very dizzy bird on the win that Donald is turning. I I like to note that Barks really likes these gag and I think that they're starting to become a little bit more common

114
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:02,667
as he goes.

115
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:06,375
Alright. And sitting you're looking at it and I didn't even notice the bert.

116
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:15,852
Yeah. And and and keep an eye out for these side gag, because again, he he really does have a lot of fun with those. And then, you know, a lot of people

117
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,286
would say that Don Rose is kind of the spiritual successor

118
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,855
to Barks, There there are a lot of people who would probably take issue with that. But

119
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:30,545
he did a lot of sequels to these stories and he kind of carries that. Tradition on and

120
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:32,785
maybe expands on it.

121
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:42,547
So on the next page, you know, the Ducktales kind of write off the possibility of getting the kelp from skull Eye reef and they head back to the island

122
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:45,035
that they seemed to be headquartered from

123
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:46,074
And

124
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:59,300
I I wanna take a brief moments to kind of acknowledge that the island that they're on it's it's a really interesting place. Right? Because Barks goes out of his way to depict this very, like,

125
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,600
multicultural

126
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,684
mix, like on Al launch of accents, there's some, like, Caribbean

127
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:06,841
accents

128
00:12:07,178 --> 00:12:08,476
and some French

129
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:10,368
or cage and accent

130
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:16,335
and some, like, Mexican or Spanish and there's a guy who looks very brit. So

131
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:24,037
the reason that I really wanted to go out of my way to highlight that is that we're about to enter into

132
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,610
a series of stories,

133
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:37,345
many of which are all time classics, but we kind of also happen to be heading into sort of a rough patch as well where there gonna be some pretty unfortunate

134
00:12:37,925 --> 00:13:01,355
depictions and and car. So I did wanna to highlight that Barks is very capable of, you know, depicting this kind of this kind of setting and I like that a lot. But the the interesting thing the du are really focused on their their job and what they're trying to do with the seaweed and they don't notice that all in the background, there are these like, very ominous

135
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,410
rumbling, people talking about

136
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:10,664
a really terrible event that would means that everyone is every

137
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:13,538
conversation is about the need to keep

138
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:23,580
their children locked up somewhere safe. And it's very ominous tonight is the night. They repeat that a couple of times. Tonight is the night fran,

139
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,900
one man says to another

140
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,840
tonight Bain the night, Tony,

141
00:13:28,294 --> 00:13:46,333
another says, and we're gonna wanna remember that line. And so by the end of this page, Donald has come to terms with the fact that, you know, the only way to get this help is the dangerous way, which he's motivated to. I didn't mention that they learned that the price of kelp has shot up yet again. I also noticed

142
00:13:46,671 --> 00:14:04,470
how he seem to make a point of where like, everybody's from a different country kind of. The guy the guy who's kind of tying them up when they reach the doc seem kind of American to me and then we have French accent, Spanish accent, this guy and a Helmet this guy with a kind of a looking thing. Right. Yeah. Yeah. It felt very naturally

143
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:11,980
multicultural. Alright. So on the next page, the dots are talking about their plans. To go out and some old

144
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,555
c hand and a sailor at the dock over hears them and he, you know, he's he's

145
00:14:18,134 --> 00:14:32,546
gas. He's asking Donald, you know, you're not planning to leave your kids un guarded tonight. Are you? Donald has no idea what he's referring to and he tells him, but but tonight May, tonight is the night. So we're getting this ominous through line

146
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:38,702
again. And and he reveals that the reason everyone is talking is that

147
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,695
tonight is the night that somebody's little boy will be stolen. And Donald very naturally wants to get some more information about this.

148
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:54,161
And he he pumps him for information. And the guy just every question, Donald asks who's doing it why?

149
00:14:55,455 --> 00:14:56,475
Why tonight,

150
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:59,135
he keeps responding nobody knows.

151
00:14:59,455 --> 00:14:59,955
And,

152
00:15:00,295 --> 00:15:03,729
you know, Donald kind of writes him off but another

153
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:09,561
old salt, another sailor comes up and and comes to clarify more information

154
00:15:10,513 --> 00:15:14,326
He's got a bit of an accent that maybe be Caribbean

155
00:15:14,744 --> 00:15:15,244
or

156
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:23,366
or Latino of some kind. All I know is that when I was seven, and I red, you have not heard of eats mystery.

157
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:29,140
I was confused. I didn't get that it was its mystery. I thought there was something called eats me.

158
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:33,562
Yeah. The first guy, the first guy has, like, a pipe and a cap feels like...

159
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:37,469
Feels like new newfound lender maine or something like that.

160
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:55,836
Of an old, you know, see... Yeah. It looks like with Al really caught fishermen or something. Yeah. There you go. And then the the last guy looks I guess some stripes on his sleeve. He looks like maybe a captain or something. Yeah. Like you say everyone looks like they're from somewhere else on this caribbean island. Alright. So this

161
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:59,347
the second guy, he does a better job of explaining,

162
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:00,185
he

163
00:16:00,722 --> 00:16:01,715
tells about

164
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:06,822
kind of the curse really of this island is that every fifty years

165
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,740
on

166
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:09,056
this night

167
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:13,181
a little boy has been stolen and has never seen again.

168
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:16,851
This is that's happened seven times

169
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:31,354
since the centuries when the first one disappeared, and, you know, Donald rightfully is like, well, man, you need to do something about it. And he explained that their way of doing something about it is locking their little kids up and watching them carefully.

170
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:40,535
And Donald is not concerned because he tells him, you know, no one's gonna come for him out on skull Ir reef where we're going.

171
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:48,050
Before the Ducktales take off, one of the Nephews asks if there's ever been any clue about who's doing the stealing.

172
00:16:48,845 --> 00:16:49,345
And

173
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:56,145
the old sailor explains that the only clue from a long time ago is a footprint of an armored

174
00:16:56,445 --> 00:17:05,000
man. And you know, this is a moment of surprise for the nephews as they wonder, you know, are there knights in these indies.

175
00:17:05,614 --> 00:17:06,114
And

176
00:17:06,454 --> 00:17:12,687
one of the nephews makes the comment that nights haven't been seen. Armor hasn't been worn around here since the days of the Al,

177
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:33,725
and I liked the Barks kind of snuck that into to fore shadow a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My... I had a a like, a wikipedia brown moments on this this page thinking, you know, what what is the difference between a footprint of an armored foot versus, like a boot if you had like a horse riding boot? Yeah. That look different in the mud.

178
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,220
So maybe there could be a some impression in the in the metal by the the crafter. Right?

179
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,095
Yeah. Maybe her manager

180
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:49,175
seal or something like that. So the interesting thing between these two pages to me is that now we're leaving this island

181
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:53,105
and the rest of this story is gonna take place almost

182
00:17:53,523 --> 00:18:00,104
entirely on Skull I reef. You know, it's not not quite a bottle episode, but it is really

183
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:06,950
interesting to me that he's able to get so much out of this setting. Because the ducts returned to the reef

184
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:13,790
And by the time they get there, it's high tide. And this has kind of transformed the reef because the little

185
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,242
peaks of it are just poking out as though it's like a little

186
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:27,643
chain, a circular island chain and they they see some channels that have been formed that almost look big enough to flow back into

187
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:29,820
Donald Picks one to try.

188
00:18:30,354 --> 00:18:30,854
And

189
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:39,420
you know, feels lucky and they they basically let a wave pick them up and deposit them with a big thud

190
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,339
halfway

191
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:49,010
onto the reef far enough that they can manage their win, their pin to get in and gather the kill. Yeah. Yeah. So

192
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:52,496
would have been very concerned about that. But apparently Donald does not.

193
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,366
Yeah. Especially with a rental

194
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:56,243
boat.

195
00:18:57,656 --> 00:19:00,725
Yeah. So... But man, he really wants that

196
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:02,043
wants that

197
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,435
count. Yeah. It's nothing there. Yep.

198
00:19:05,973 --> 00:19:07,725
And and i... Al extra dollar it's on

199
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:13,030
I wanted to kinda highlight the two panels that, you know, where the boat gets lifted.

200
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:26,531
I think the water rushing pass the boat looks really neat and then the thud that they land with is really well drawn. And I i like that Al lot. So... Yeah. Yeah. You can kinda see the the way flashing up above the the gun there and

201
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:39,110
There's definitely some force from here. Right. Yeah. I think it I think it conveys that movement really well on the weight of the boat. So on the next page, they're they're on their merry way. They are

202
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:46,116
getting as much kelp as they possibly can. The nephews are enjoying seeing a

203
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:59,843
version of fifteen men on the dead man's chest. It's fifteen barn on the Captain's chest. And then as the tide goes down, they start to see a little bit more in the interior of the reef and

204
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:10,265
get a a really big pile. They get their tongs onto a big pile of kelp and try to quote, yank the whole aboard. And they see something

205
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:16,055
underneath the pile of kelp, and it's revealed to be part of a ship So the Ducktales proceed

206
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:22,298
to yank more and more of the kelp until we cut to a panel at the bottom of this page,

207
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:26,527
and they've cleared it and they see that the ship is...

208
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:33,991
Donald says it's an old gal and one of the nephews says, or it's a British man war. Pointing out the gun ports.

209
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,367
No. I think it's I think it's pretty cool.

210
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:42,610
The way, you know, we're kind of investigating escalating. We've already gotten a little bit of the mystery, but now we're escalating via,

211
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,010
you know what what's going on here

212
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:54,820
and kind of setting up our the conditions of the bottle that we're going be in for the rest of the issue. Yeah. Definitely. I think there's some really good sort of table setting here.

213
00:20:55,918 --> 00:21:05,052
And I I wanna really note that this is just to me, this panel is gorgeous. The way he's drawn this old ship, it it's half sunk and it looks

214
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:08,615
very detailed. As does the reef, I think this one

215
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,095
would be instantly

216
00:21:11,595 --> 00:21:12,095
recognizable

217
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:13,015
to

218
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:15,630
longtime Barks fans as a very

219
00:21:16,128 --> 00:21:17,187
beautiful panel.

220
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:22,097
And then of course, we're gonna realize that it is the nephew that's right

221
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:32,164
that it must be a British manual war based on the nationality of the armored man that we haven't met yet. Mh. Alright. So on the next page, they decide to

222
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,655
explore the ship.

223
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,770
And

224
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,690
Donald

225
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,370
takes a raft over

226
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,130
hops onto to the deck, which

227
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,450
is revealed to be rotten immediately

228
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:48,980
after and if he warns him, he crashes through into the hole.

229
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,099
The Nephews

230
00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:52,955
toss him line and Donald Scrooge

231
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:59,648
down in the hold and as he's pulled up an immense octopus tent or arm

232
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:01,300
snakes up after him,

233
00:22:01,913 --> 00:22:02,413
and

234
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,490
tentacles

235
00:22:04,187 --> 00:22:08,476
from the ship indicate that there just a massive octopus

236
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:14,004
in there. And one of the nephews says a great line. Yee cats is all that one octopus.

237
00:22:14,822 --> 00:22:20,405
This is at least the third point in the comic where they used some some phrase that I've never heard anyone used before.

238
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:24,548
And, how much of it is is

239
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:36,634
Disney corn and how much of it is how people actually talk about that? Yeah. I think it's a little column and a little bit of column b. I mean, some of these are just kind of like, forties and fifties speak. But

240
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:37,434
if

241
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:49,829
growing up at this time, this this is like, almost my word balloons. Right? I would have mentally say yee cats to myself a couple of times a week because I was so steep and reading these Barks

242
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:56,172
stories. So I was a kid in the late eighties and and early nineties with this kind of like, mental vocabulary.

243
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,926
So we've got kind of this other

244
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,739
background menace now set up with this giant octopus.

245
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:11,514
And on the next page, you know, the docs acknowledge, that okay, we're not... Obviously we're not exploring that anymore. And night falls

246
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:21,649
and there's just a generally creepy vibe for the ducks on the boat as they get ready to go to bed. The Nephews have kind of talked themselves into feeling spooked

247
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:28,017
because earlier in the day, of course, they heard Al this tale of the ghost kidnapping kids,

248
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:33,855
and then they've just encountered this weird ship and the octopus. So they're rightfully creeped out.

249
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:41,235
And then we transition to a couple of really nice nighttime panel Scrooge and silhouette

250
00:23:41,852 --> 00:23:42,831
of the

251
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:50,460
of the ship rack. And Barks sits in in a narrative box. He says that the moon

252
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:58,075
rides once more above the hull of the Ancient man war and we cut to the deck where the door creek ominous

253
00:23:58,412 --> 00:23:58,912
open.

254
00:23:59,424 --> 00:24:05,325
And indeed an armored man steps out of it and says tonight is yi unite.

255
00:24:05,963 --> 00:24:13,590
And this is another are just really to me. It's a stunning panel. I I love the slow setup of this in the ominous

256
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:20,685
creek of the door and the way that he's drawn and realized and the way that the moonlight gl off of his armor

257
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:22,885
and his sword is

258
00:24:23,225 --> 00:24:24,165
very memorable

259
00:24:24,465 --> 00:24:24,785
to me.

260
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:29,647
Yeah. And his face is still totally obscured except for

261
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:31,141
his eyes.

262
00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:34,930
As we know cartoon characters eyes are always visible even in the dark.

263
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:41,865
So we're still getting some mystery here. You know, he's he's spoken and he's appeared. So we know he's not just a story.

264
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:44,135
That the islanders tell themselves,

265
00:24:44,712 --> 00:25:02,736
but we still don't know anything about even like what kind of animal he is necessarily. Also, it wasn't until this reread just now as we're doing the podcast guess then I noticed the sc on the moon's face as the moon is rising above Yeah. That's right. And and that one I've seen mentions in a couple of write ups. Sparks usually kind of,

266
00:25:03,273 --> 00:25:06,142
you know, avoids these like sill side

267
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:17,420
during serious moments, but it is a little moment of of levi during this kinda creepy moment. And I wonder if he, like, talked himself into it because this is very

268
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,420
deeply

269
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,115
creepy

270
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:23,680
story. Right? Like, this is a a generational sort of kidnapping.

271
00:25:24,238 --> 00:25:32,335
And so, you know, I don't know. Maybe he was just having some fun with it or maybe he wanted to defuse it a little bit. So on the next page,

272
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:42,445
it's now the crack of Dawn and the du are getting ready for the days business. They've got to get the ship ready to float back at the right tide again.

273
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:47,270
Donald is giving orders to his nephews on how to get ready.

274
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:53,470
We get some pretty good nautical speak here. You know, he and instruct Huey, to start the engine, Loo to oil the wrench.

275
00:25:54,047 --> 00:26:04,893
And then dewey is told to stand by the caps stand and keep the anchor chains str. I don't think I could tell you what that means. And then Dewey does not respond

276
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:11,287
and, you know, the audience has immediately figured out that he must have been taken, but Donald is

277
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:13,919
searching for his his lazy nephew

278
00:26:14,695 --> 00:26:19,996
until one of the Nephews thanks to step off the boat onto the little,

279
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:21,831
you know, at toll or

280
00:26:22,528 --> 00:26:28,235
part of the reef that they're on and he sees the tracks of an armored man.

281
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:29,675
Again, I noticed

282
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:32,275
Al as we get the caption,

283
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:38,490
the first crack of Dawn, it shows the sun just below it rising above the water with the word? Correct? Yes.

284
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:45,184
Yeah. Thanks for pointing that out. That's another of those kind of noteworthy site gag that's always cited in this and

285
00:26:45,523 --> 00:27:11,699
it's just another little fun moment of levi. There's also a pretty funny looking bird again in the background. I'm I'm figuring out doing these reread now and really focused on the art Barks just loved draw Barks or at least during this era. Yeah. That's that evident I likes some Barks, and he likes some notable terminology as you noticed. Right. Alright. And so on the next page, you know, Donald has instantly

286
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:16,481
clocked that something's wrong, there might be something to the kidnapping story.

287
00:27:16,858 --> 00:27:17,358
So,

288
00:27:17,815 --> 00:27:22,845
you know, they follow the tracks as far as they can that they disappear into the waves it's been erased.

289
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:25,845
And then Donald very sen

290
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:33,950
says that, you know, he must have been taken back to the island because, like, what other alternative really would there be?

291
00:27:34,962 --> 00:27:39,506
But one of the nephews wonders if the Armored man could have come from the old ship.

292
00:27:40,143 --> 00:27:43,528
Donald points out that, you know, most of the time that completely

293
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:51,841
underwater and the nephews used rightfully for kids who have just, you know, realized one of their brothers is missing. Wonder if it's a ghost.

294
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:52,915
And

295
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:54,233
Donald

296
00:27:54,852 --> 00:28:00,720
says, you know, Fu, he had to come from the island. They're gonna go back and tear the place apart

297
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:09,841
And then one of the f catches that they can't go back because Al large hole has been in the ship and it might have been caused by a sword.

298
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:14,151
Condolences says we're trapped in his bottle episode until we resolve the conflict.

299
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,959
He didn't really say that. It was implied. It was implied. Absolutely.

300
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:21,914
Alright. So...

301
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:32,721
Yeah. So we're just getting some some good clues the footsteps that go down to just below the surface of the water and then disappear. That either distract were washed away or that was his destination.

302
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:34,340
Right. Exactly.

303
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:40,544
So the docs are realizing that they're pretty well stuck. And Donald is getting

304
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,541
more nervous about, you know, the possibility that maybe it is a ghost. He doesn't really know what's going on.

305
00:28:47,273 --> 00:28:55,907
But he is continuing to keep a pretty level Huey,. You know, his next move is to radio the news to port and get help as quick as possible.

306
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,120
And then he realized that the

307
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,960
wires have been stripped off of the radio.

308
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:09,291
And, you know, the line there, he says that iron plated crook stripped the wires off the radio.

309
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:10,968
There's a couple of other

310
00:29:11,507 --> 00:29:15,897
moments in the on this page where he's starting to use some pretty funny nickname

311
00:29:16,595 --> 00:29:20,350
for, you know, he doesn't really know anything other than that he's an armored man.

312
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:21,983
He says that

313
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:27,052
a guy that runs around in ten pants and a hot climate like this is capable of anything.

314
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:31,380
And and that was something that I picked up on this reading. He's got some pretty amusing

315
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:41,295
expressions for for the Armored man. But he he they figured that he's probably the the man probably used the wires to tie up dewey.

316
00:29:41,855 --> 00:29:44,155
So his next step is to ask

317
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:44,855
Huey,

318
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,328
lights and signal rockets.

319
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:52,940
And he figures out that they were in the hold which has been completely flooded with water.

320
00:29:53,474 --> 00:29:54,412
Yeah. So

321
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:57,480
I like... I mean, this page seems to be just

322
00:29:58,216 --> 00:30:13,575
plugging pla. I'm just like, well, why didn't they just why don't they just radio for help or whatever and or send some rockets or whatever. And the fact that he probably used the I would have thought, you know, a soldier from four hundred years ago, certainly wouldn't know to destroy their radio

323
00:30:13,915 --> 00:30:15,175
so they can't get help

324
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,750
but if he's just looking for something along and and durable to tie his

325
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,630
kidnapping victim up with, then

326
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:33,180
that makes sense. Yeah. I agree with you. I think this this page showed some care and that sort of as you say, why didn't they this? Why didn't they this and a lot of creators

327
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:42,841
don't always take the time. And in some stories parks doesn't really take the time to kind of explain potential plot holes like that. Alright. So their

328
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:52,667
their next best hope then because they're logically going through their options is to light a signal fire. So Donald says they need to go to the highest

329
00:30:53,405 --> 00:30:53,905
ridge

330
00:30:54,244 --> 00:31:00,895
on the reef and he tells the Nephews who's to light it there. And the nephews discover that there is a hole in that one.

331
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:01,995
And

332
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:03,555
one of the nephews

333
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:07,964
says that it sounds hollow, like, there's a big cavern underneath

334
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:08,801
or

335
00:31:09,138 --> 00:31:11,153
if you will, maybe a g.

336
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,269
And

337
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:20,715
Donald is skeptical, but the nephew you says, well, Yell down in the hole and you'll hear it echo. And so he he yells, hello. This is Louie

338
00:31:21,335 --> 00:31:22,635
and they hear

339
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,648
Hello. This is Dewey.

340
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:28,444
And there's a fun moment where the ducks all simultaneously

341
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:39,215
lean in and p their heads together. And I thought it was a nice touch that they didn't really even express any pain from that. It's a good gag, but it just shows that they're really interested.

342
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:44,624
Focused on getting him back. Yeah. I'll also point out for the listeners

343
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:47,301
that the highest point on the reef is probably

344
00:31:47,855 --> 00:31:50,755
ten to fifteen feet high, It's not an impressive peak.

345
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:53,635
Will make very little difference. But...

346
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:54,175
Yeah.

347
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,370
I like... I like that the echo,

348
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:05,702
the echo they expected was different. Was a nice touch. Yeah. I I thought that was a really good gap. Alright. So they are

349
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,696
they're figuring more and more stuff out.

350
00:32:09,154 --> 00:32:13,127
They they know now where he is and you can kinda see them audibly

351
00:32:14,397 --> 00:32:20,195
exhale Al little bit because they know that he's okay and they so they start to plan how they're gonna get down there.

352
00:32:21,345 --> 00:32:21,845
He

353
00:32:22,385 --> 00:32:24,245
when when he has

354
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:27,265
tried to tell them, you know, the situation,

355
00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:29,525
his voice gets muffled,

356
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,240
because the armored man has clearly clamped it shut his mouth shut.

357
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,300
And

358
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:42,155
they decide to search the reef for another entrance thinking that there's gotta to be a hole that's above the tide.

359
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:47,890
But they're not able to find one. So Donald says that they're gonna make an entrance out of this one,

360
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:53,090
and they're gonna use their tongs on their boat to just yank the entrance open.

361
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,770
And Donald

362
00:32:55,365 --> 00:33:00,779
closes by saying if you can get the tongs into old ten pants, we'll yank him out of there too,

363
00:33:01,357 --> 00:33:03,315
which I thought was an awesome line.

364
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:04,987
This is part of the

365
00:33:05,324 --> 00:33:14,655
ingenuity that you pointed out the beginning of the episode where they're using their resources that are available to them. We're getting, you know, the clever donald and he's very determined and very

366
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:22,595
resourceful and level headed right in the crisis here. Alright. So by by the afternoon, on the next page, they've expanded the whole enough to get down.

367
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:31,000
And, you know, the kids are wondering what he's planning on doing when he's lowered. They asked him, you know, you're not going in there unarmed and donald,

368
00:33:31,455 --> 00:33:33,473
has... He's got a shotgun,

369
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,869
which he calls a twelve gauge can opener

370
00:33:37,408 --> 00:33:45,027
so that I can make a dent in that tin of medieval sausage. And I just I love that line. Almost all the lines on this page are great.

371
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:49,310
You know, they're they're pretty nervous. They say that this is pretty risky.

372
00:33:50,085 --> 00:33:59,305
I like how determined Donald is here. He says, I don't care if there's a foundry full of Sherman tanks. I'm going down. And then there's a sequence where he

373
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:08,852
He says lower me boys as he gets lowered by a line into the hole. And then when he gets down to the bottom of the hole, he sees

374
00:34:09,229 --> 00:34:15,126
the Armored man is lighting an old cannon and aimed directly up and he yells h me boys.

375
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:18,591
And he narrowly avoids the cannon fire

376
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:25,145
and, you know, they've gotta to figure something else out. And and again, this is just a great gag. It's it's

377
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:40,981
exciting. It's funny. It's very well drawn. And last f refers to the Armored man is old boiler is Oh, yeah. Another another excellent nickname. Thank you for catching that old boiler breaches. And unfortunately, Donald has dropped his

378
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,234
twelve twelve gauge can opener

379
00:34:43,772 --> 00:34:49,426
as he... As he was clamoring back up for his life. That's right. So, yeah, he he

380
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:50,920
the nephew...

381
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,440
He reminds the nephews that

382
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,660
they still need to light that signal fire.

383
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:05,135
But the man doubts as if we because he can reach it from here. And, you know, this is like, about the first time where Donald loses his temper

384
00:35:05,888 --> 00:35:08,461
pretty impressive for Donald Duck. And

385
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:16,212
he if we've got another excellent nickname here. He says, that's not fair. Come out of your whole and fight you cast iron gop.

386
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:28,157
And and this is the nephews, the two nephews turn to kind of have a nice level head. They've got a really great plan here. They logically say, you know, he's he's really nervous.

387
00:35:29,055 --> 00:35:40,791
He's scared about them bringing in reinforcement. So what they wanna do is they wanna light a signal fire much farther away. One that's gonna draw them out, draw him out, and then they'll try and grab him with the tongs.

388
00:35:41,328 --> 00:35:51,535
And before as they're lighting the signal fire, they see that the tides come out again and the old ship is now showing. Yeah. And and I think they have learned at this point that it's not a whole

389
00:35:51,874 --> 00:35:54,329
a whole swarm armored men as one of the nephews

390
00:35:54,906 --> 00:35:55,406
speculated.

391
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:59,090
Right. Yeah. They know they've got a solitary opponent. So

392
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:03,381
They've got the upper hand on him as long as they can keep their head.

393
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:04,959
Alright? So

394
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:13,791
this the story takes place over just a couple of days. We see a nice clear passage of time, We get fall once again. And the ducks are just

395
00:36:14,209 --> 00:36:20,868
staring at the hole because they figure donald Al least figures that that's the only way he can get out.

396
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:28,480
And one of the nephews is skeptical because he thinks he heard a creek on the old ship, but Donald is like, no,

397
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:31,505
only the whole stair stare at the hole.

398
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:39,060
We see the armored man is exiting from the ship. And we see him take a little boat out

399
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,340
through a swinging door in the man war,

400
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,300
and

401
00:36:43,654 --> 00:37:04,817
he uses some of that old English he speak that sorta of shake Experience, Pho she with my trusty blade. I must sally for and he says Bonnie Queen be will nightly me for this night's work. Bonnie Queen Beth is a nickname for Elizabeth. And so that's how we can be pretty sure that he's British. And so Donald again says keep watching

402
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,430
in front of us

403
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:13,750
and we get this pretty famous scene of the night boarding the ship, very men

404
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:14,970
wielding is sword.

405
00:37:15,704 --> 00:37:16,804
Behind the du.

406
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:19,321
This was used for the cover

407
00:37:20,379 --> 00:37:27,964
that Barks in in oil of this scene. This is very iconic I noticed the Ama man's first line on this page is Jan Von

408
00:37:28,303 --> 00:37:34,407
ill. Yeah. I have no idea what that what that means. So there... If we have any four hundred year old listeners,

409
00:37:35,064 --> 00:37:37,219
they can they can comment on your facebook page.

410
00:37:37,818 --> 00:37:42,281
We we can. Yes. I I'll take a crack at it. Right? Jan is just

411
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:43,876
va over theirs.

412
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:55,225
Yeah. Right. And I think a viral is just to like, a ras. Oh okay. And, you know, boat Ill is just bear bearing you ill will, I think. But I think that this is really just the sort of, like,

413
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:56,499
Robinhood

414
00:37:56,838 --> 00:37:58,217
ease that audiences

415
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:00,734
from the forties would have expected.

416
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:08,734
Effective. Yeah. Alright. So fortunately on the next page Donald gotten hungry and he asks for a tomato from their basket.

417
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:11,847
Finding it to be overnight. He toss it backwards.

418
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:16,889
Right into the armored man's face. He gives the old tiny

419
00:38:17,745 --> 00:38:19,221
swear odds Barks

420
00:38:20,074 --> 00:38:25,403
which I'm not convinced anyone actually said, but apparently is like one of those bla me

421
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,849
curse because it's like god's body. Like a way of saying God's body.

422
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:31,769
And

423
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:32,930
they

424
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:42,304
they realized that he's behind them the Armored man, he takes Al slice at them, but misses and they have to scatter and hide themselves into the kelp.

425
00:38:42,764 --> 00:39:10,245
The the arm man's very frustrated, but at least you can kick their fire, their signal fire into the sea. And this is a very very quick but action packed page that's very dramatic and satisfying to me. Yeah. That's very visual. I like that Donald probably would have thrown a run tomato into the guy's face if you had known the guy was there, but he accidentally did it anyway. A little happens stands. And you know, I'm just noticing on this read through right now, how cool it is that the

426
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:17,040
armored man is generally drawn in silhouette until the last panel of the page as he's kicking the fire. His...

427
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:30,824
The the glare of the fire really illuminate him neatly in a way that just looks very cool artistic. Yeah. Alright there's a lot of detail on his armor. And you can see all the little pieces on the on the Barks and there's different pieces on the chest and

428
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:31,744
right.

429
00:39:32,124 --> 00:39:34,344
Helmet has little flares on it and,

430
00:39:34,924 --> 00:39:37,224
yeah. Even the sword has kind of

431
00:39:37,524 --> 00:39:42,271
an interesting hilt on it. There's would taken quite a while to draw this guy in every frame.

432
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:52,058
Yeah. Exactly. And when you consider that he was doing two full length stories for this month's release. Alright. So on the next page, the Ducktales are regroup.

433
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:58,185
They figure out that he's left, and so they get back to their boat and they'd cast a search light on him.

434
00:39:59,158 --> 00:40:00,336
Not finding him

435
00:40:00,674 --> 00:40:01,174
anywhere.

436
00:40:01,551 --> 00:40:11,582
And and then one of the nephews hears that creek again, and he turns the light onto the ship and they do finally see the Armored man going into a hole in the stern,

437
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:21,449
which is the back of the boat. Right? I think I probably learned that from this one. Oh I learned that from getting my canoe badge at age twelve. Excellent.

438
00:40:23,283 --> 00:40:23,983
So it's.

439
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,100
The the ducks here are also

440
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,297
in mostly silhouette

441
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:49,307
for the the top half of this page. So we just get there. They're outlined and they're lit eyes, of course, and then and then kind of a cool shot with there. One of them holding that that kind of hook pike sort of thing they use for the Kelp and one i them manning the search light. Yeah. That's right. It's a boat hook, which I learned from last week episode or the the one previous terror of the river.

442
00:40:50,304 --> 00:41:10,552
And and it's a cool panel too where they're turning the lights. The bottom left panel where they're, like, partially illuminated and partially. Yeah. Partially dark. And same thing with the the armored man. Alright. So they've they've realized they pretty much figured everything out right now. Right? Donald snaps and it kind of represents the audience knowing everything.

443
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:11,885
So

444
00:41:12,465 --> 00:41:17,805
finally, now that we've got everything, I think Barks to decides that we can flash down into

445
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:22,375
the armored man's hideout out where he's loading. He's reloading his

446
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:23,814
old tiny

447
00:41:24,392 --> 00:41:32,723
gun and talking with Dewey who refers to him as jingle joints and what a mess of trouble he got himself in when he couldn't kidnapped him.

448
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:34,170
And

449
00:41:34,668 --> 00:41:43,542
the Arm man says verily, they they say at the book full, another line that I really like. And so they light another signal fire, they're getting ready for the morning

450
00:41:43,854 --> 00:41:50,056
and Donald says, okay. Well, now we we know we've got to get past the ship, so we've got to think of a way to get past the octopus.

451
00:41:50,393 --> 00:41:54,618
And by the time low tide comes around, one of the f fuse Huey,

452
00:41:54,997 --> 00:42:03,583
says that he's got a plan. He's rolling a large slab of meat full to the brim with Chili pepper saying that that'll get rid of the octopus.

453
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:14,185
Seems like a good plan. It does. Yeah. I also liked that line from the Armored man. It was good. Just like man, this is lot harder than it was fifty years ago and a hundred years ago.

454
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:17,640
Old time speak for... You're you're not kidding.

455
00:42:18,894 --> 00:42:19,714
Yeah. Yeah.

456
00:42:20,174 --> 00:42:20,674
Also,

457
00:42:21,054 --> 00:42:25,634
this issue provides some practical knowledge on how to defeat a kaiju if ever you are

458
00:42:26,094 --> 00:42:26,954
confronted with

459
00:42:27,389 --> 00:42:28,608
two hundred foot monster.

460
00:42:29,187 --> 00:42:31,485
That's right. Yeah. Because the

461
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,299
the chili meat is gonna turn out to be very effective.

462
00:42:35,795 --> 00:42:37,334
They use the tongs to hop

463
00:42:37,795 --> 00:42:39,214
to drop it into the hatch,

464
00:42:39,674 --> 00:42:43,549
and they hear him eating it. And then we get just this

465
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:49,423
spectacular. I don't know. Maybe this is divisive. But i I absolutely love this panel of the octopus

466
00:42:50,082 --> 00:42:51,880
rising and spicy agony.

467
00:42:52,493 --> 00:42:59,273
From the ship, utterly ob it. It's a full half page. There are sea Barks,

468
00:42:59,392 --> 00:43:00,849
fleeing the dev devastation.

469
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:03,500
There's a great expression on the octopus

470
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:17,485
face. And then nephew says, u oh, I must used sprinkle too much pepper. And when I read this, at age either seven or eight. I was I was pretty much hollow with laughter between this one and the next panel.

471
00:43:18,978 --> 00:43:25,890
I do think this is probably a moment of levi that Barks you know, stuck in because he wanted to diffuse this.

472
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:33,548
Pretty creepy story. But... But I just... I love it so much. Yeah. It's definitely a memorable frame. I also

473
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:37,117
Yeah. It's definitely a memorable frame. I also

474
00:43:37,776 --> 00:43:42,351
did notice until we're reading it now that he's finally doing some, like half page splashes.

475
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:46,673
Instead of just eight of the page eighth of the pay eighth of the page. Here's some

476
00:43:47,448 --> 00:43:59,261
exposition He's taking some time to kind of savor her some of the visuals. Yeah. There a few and far between, but sometimes he does get to push the medium. K. So on the next page, we get our last glimpse of the octopus

477
00:43:59,855 --> 00:44:02,595
using his tentacles to to run away

478
00:44:04,535 --> 00:44:10,187
over the reef and one of the nephews gets off the great line. Wonder what Huey, give for a ton of ice cream.

479
00:44:10,987 --> 00:44:12,805
And this is left the entrance

480
00:44:13,664 --> 00:44:14,563
exposed. The

481
00:44:14,942 --> 00:44:20,335
g has a trap door on it. That they figure is locked from below.

482
00:44:20,955 --> 00:44:33,167
You know, they can open it with the tongs, but the nephews are out of idea But Donald got one now. He says he's got a plan and that all he needs is a squirt gun and a couple of mice. So they find a single mouse

483
00:44:33,544 --> 00:44:40,679
from in the galley the nephews are very surprised that that's all he wants to combat the Armored man. But

484
00:44:41,295 --> 00:44:47,590
Donald takes a look at the grow mouse and says that likes the Al in his eyes. And then he takes

485
00:44:47,927 --> 00:44:49,065
the squirt gun

486
00:44:49,401 --> 00:44:52,173
filled with roach powder and he heads off and

487
00:44:52,805 --> 00:44:56,580
just a really cool line from the Al few, so I'm gonna read it in its entirety.

488
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:28,692
Go into battle Al armored man with a square gun and a mouse. Do you suppose on mcdonald's in his right mind? I hope not his sensible ideas never work. So Donald arrives at the trap door and asks the nephews used to open it. And he's getting ready to squirt the man with the roach powder, but he comes up with a with a gun instead of a sword, like Donald expect Donald is able to duck the shot in the nick of time. He squirt the armored man with the powder and he falls cla into the g and Donald

489
00:45:29,788 --> 00:45:33,478
drops down with the mouse who he has nicknamed mont more,

490
00:45:33,855 --> 00:45:40,437
which, again, just a great little random touch, the fur ferocious mouse that's sn in his cage.

491
00:45:40,935 --> 00:45:44,831
The harvard man, of course is wielding. It's like a blender bust. It's not even the

492
00:45:45,144 --> 00:45:48,874
any kind of gun that we would have seen in the last two or three hundred years.

493
00:45:49,928 --> 00:45:56,626
The the big kind of bell at the end like like trumpet. I guess it's a kind of musk, but

494
00:45:57,443 --> 00:45:58,781
I also thought it was interesting

495
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,591
to see a small realistic looking mouse in a Disney comic.

496
00:46:04,324 --> 00:46:20,033
In in theoretically the same world that Mickey mouse lives in. And I I wondered about the the laws of this universe again. And again, it's just for a Barks fan, it's just some thing that's total background. You know we'll probably stop thinking about it another five to ten issues in.

497
00:46:20,689 --> 00:46:24,636
So while man is distracted, you know, with the Agony of

498
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:27,156
Roach pattern his eyes, Donald,

499
00:46:27,696 --> 00:46:28,916
drops, mont more,

500
00:46:29,616 --> 00:46:32,216
and says and you go, It's your job to get out.

501
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:37,136
And the Armored man freaks out. He says a demon is loose in my armor.

502
00:46:38,293 --> 00:46:42,201
He's removing his helmet. We see that he's kind of a feeble old man.

503
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:52,582
There's a panel where Donald yells at him take it off. Take it off, take it off. And I've gotta to say I'm kinda surprised that one hasn't been picked up as some kind of a meme.

504
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,119
Out of context.

505
00:46:54,456 --> 00:46:55,833
It's it's pretty funny.

506
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:59,321
So the armored man does remove all his armor.

507
00:46:59,855 --> 00:47:04,504
And he comes to his senses as Donald is standing with his

508
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:13,871
musk his sword and behind his canon and and says now we face each other on even terms sir boiler shirt and does a final touch warranty

509
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:14,651
sn.

510
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:16,962
Very fierce some tiny mouse.

511
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,032
I have to say this this was immediately reminiscent to me of

512
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:26,874
my favorite musical number from another Disney property fin and fe. There is an early episode

513
00:47:27,332 --> 00:47:28,032
in which

514
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:34,116
Fe older sister is trying to be on a date and her nemesis has

515
00:47:35,015 --> 00:47:51,505
some acorns into her pants and two squirrels immediately dive into her pants and run around the inside of her pants to try and find the acorns. And then we have a... Yes, a fantastic two minute number called squirrel in my pants done by two two freestyle rappers who happen to be there in the park and think that she

516
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:55,800
metaphorically has some squirrels in her pants, and that's why she's dancing so awesome.

517
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:02,347
And she actually moves a lot like this guy. Like, it's it's kind of the same I guess it's the universal way of indicating.

518
00:48:02,805 --> 00:48:05,061
I have small mammals inside of my trousers.

519
00:48:06,277 --> 00:48:08,872
That's true. I wonder. This is how a person moves.

520
00:48:09,606 --> 00:48:12,866
It is it is a... Another Disney property maybe

521
00:48:13,886 --> 00:48:14,866
what are their names,

522
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:16,026
swamp

523
00:48:16,485 --> 00:48:16,985
and

524
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:28,665
trying to remember the funniest creators. And Pub meyer. That's right. And Jeff Marsh. Right? Maybe Yeah. Maybe they were big Barks fans, who knows. That extremely plausible. Yeah.

525
00:48:29,146 --> 00:48:33,806
Alright. So on the next page, you know, everyone is reunited. They've rescued

526
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:49,526
Dewey, and the Armored man is despair what's gonna become with him, what is his lord, Surface Francis drake. What will he think of him and he reveals that he was safeguard a treasure and he didn't keep the gold safe.

527
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:57,971
Donald sees the the gold and he starts to drool over it, and they hear his story because of now. Now, of course, they can.

528
00:48:58,823 --> 00:49:06,299
They reveal, you know, the the du figure out that this guy thinks that sir Francis drake is still alive and

529
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:15,082
they kind of all sit around the lantern and he explains how, you know, a ship was washed over this reef

530
00:49:15,434 --> 00:49:18,723
and had crashed into the cavern above

531
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:19,959
and

532
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:29,533
that the captain of the ship ended up staying to guard the treasure or the the sole survivor rather stayed to the treasure.

533
00:49:30,213 --> 00:49:31,771
This is on to the next page.

534
00:49:32,226 --> 00:49:40,735
He brought the treasure down into the cavern and waited first her Francis drake to return, but as the years passed, and he got older.

535
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:41,731
He

536
00:49:42,227 --> 00:49:43,364
decided to

537
00:49:44,258 --> 00:49:49,558
embark on the kidnapping that wound up being passed down from generation

538
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,606
to generation of armored man every fifty years.

539
00:49:54,141 --> 00:50:01,161
Someone would kid nap another boy off the local island. And so the secret of the kidnapping is out.

540
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:04,726
There's another great download line on here.

541
00:50:05,263 --> 00:50:19,641
There's a couple of... All everyone's starting to talk like him now on the pre... On the previous page, then nephew used the term odds bad now. And on on this page, Don asks if the Armored man was the sole survivor of the crash four hundred years ago, and he says, no.

542
00:50:20,216 --> 00:50:21,316
The captain was

543
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:22,396
and

544
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:33,606
Donald says, thanks. Now I can start believing e calendar again. Yeah. Yeah. That was I we found that this is not some kind of immortal being that is... Yeah. Living inside the ship.

545
00:50:34,144 --> 00:50:38,773
That's a good catch because that is also one of my favorite quotes in this one. Alright. So

546
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,447
the secret is out.

547
00:50:40,783 --> 00:50:51,180
This is become sort of a generational curse rather than a supernatural one. Donald takes a quick moment to act like he is her francis drake,

548
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:58,026
but the guys like, no it's not you. I've got a picture of him in this book. So Donald isn't able to get the gold.

549
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,706
We transitioned pretty quickly

550
00:51:01,421 --> 00:51:10,016
to the depths being fed as heroes on the island for stopping this sort of generational curse. Donald asks after the gold,

551
00:51:10,676 --> 00:51:23,471
but the guy who's presenting him to the key... The key to the city, the the mayor says, sorry by salvage rights you know, the gold belongs to the man who was guarding it. And in the last panel. Right? Why don't you tell us about the last panel?

552
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:29,677
He's at Tony's burger Palace, which appears to be kind of an outdoor diner or a food truck or something.

553
00:51:30,135 --> 00:51:31,872
And he's in some ridiculous

554
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,121
clothes. This is how I would think of, like

555
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:40,067
a very os hd billionaire being dressed in maybe the twenties or the teens, I would say,

556
00:51:40,763 --> 00:51:42,675
and he's in some very

557
00:51:43,053 --> 00:52:07,871
ga clothing with a like a pocket chain and a wide pink hat and very pointy shoulders on his on his jacket and then just a big open sack of gold coins right next to him on the stool. He says another of you Hamburger sc nave, They taste mighty good, mighty with any at the end, good with any Al the end after and half century of you fish and we get it a nice little cap that is yi end. And so

558
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:08,991
that is

559
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:11,311
that is the ghost of the g

560
00:52:12,465 --> 00:52:18,592
I I know I've been fu over this one because I love this story. Almost everything

561
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:27,981
about it works for me, You know, there's just couple of, like, parts that, like it's not quite a perfect story, but to me, this is some of of Barks.

562
00:52:28,515 --> 00:52:35,876
At its best. I'll talk about that in a minute. But but you know, I'm I'm curious just right off the bat. Like, what do you think of this one?

563
00:52:36,689 --> 00:52:39,223
I love it. This this might be my new favorite one.

564
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:44,704
I like... I like a little mystery. I like that our good guys are good guys. And they

565
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:46,740
use their clever to kind of

566
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:51,847
overcome the bad guy and then solve the mystery and resolve the conflict

567
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,260
I thought it was interesting.

568
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:54,618
This is the first

569
00:52:55,037 --> 00:53:10,146
this is the first one I've read that involves a large pile of gold of the many that we've read so far that involve a large pile of gold. Where Donald did not end up with the gold. He is... He has a key to the city and the thanks of the all the people whose kids are not getting kicked kidnapped now. And

570
00:53:10,661 --> 00:53:14,140
he just has to be grumpy knowing that he's a hero instead of a rich hero.

571
00:53:14,661 --> 00:53:25,456
But, yeah. I liked the bad guy. I like that the bad guy wasn't even like evil. He just thought it was his duty, you know, too. Yeah. It's like a legacy yeah. Yeah. I like that it was all in one spot.

572
00:53:25,756 --> 00:53:27,016
I like the kind of elements

573
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:30,581
and the artwork, I like the giant octopus and just kind of

574
00:53:31,078 --> 00:53:42,976
trying to beat each other with very limited resources. I mean, this guy just has whatever was on the boat four hundred years ago, and then Donald has whatever happened to be on his boat when they went out to go, get some kelp for the day, and

575
00:53:43,796 --> 00:53:45,656
that's the nature of their combat.

576
00:53:46,451 --> 00:53:49,311
That's true. It's like a really good matching of width.

577
00:53:49,611 --> 00:53:53,271
I'm I'm really glad to hear that you liked this one. This one is

578
00:53:54,145 --> 00:54:10,371
just to me some of the best of Barks. You know? I I love the setup as you say, it's really tight. Even if this came out of like a different sort of comic ten pager setup. I feel like it's very organic how it starts out. I love the setup at the beginning.

579
00:54:10,825 --> 00:54:15,866
Where you kinda just hear these rumbling in the background. you know, it sets it up very

580
00:54:16,959 --> 00:54:17,459
and

581
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:18,869
those like

582
00:54:19,205 --> 00:54:21,100
conversations about the missing boys

583
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:25,404
make for a really great element of of creep.

584
00:54:26,035 --> 00:54:26,535
And

585
00:54:27,073 --> 00:54:32,562
you know, there there are some very silly parts, but this is a deeply dark story. Right? I mean, it's about

586
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,877
kidnapping that obviously ruined

587
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:38,942
half dozen or so lives over the course of hundreds of years.

588
00:54:39,461 --> 00:54:44,963
And, you know, the sub is that these kids were like brain washed. Into this basically

589
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:50,681
over over the centuries and grew up with this, like horrible legacy. So

590
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:55,276
I like that the Armored man gets his sort of freedom at the end.

591
00:54:56,254 --> 00:55:08,820
I think the humor in this is really great. I think my only real criticism, I did feel like the ending was just a little bit too abrupt in this one, you know, the little transition to the hamburger stand, it happens pretty quick.

592
00:55:09,198 --> 00:55:09,916
But otherwise,

593
00:55:10,834 --> 00:55:12,771
I would call this one, a masterpiece.

594
00:55:13,348 --> 00:55:13,848
And

595
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:15,245
fortunately,

596
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:16,496
the

597
00:55:16,915 --> 00:55:25,117
users of the index site would agree with me. You know, we always check index to see what that user generated

598
00:55:26,028 --> 00:55:33,561
score average is. This one is rated very high. This one gets an eight point zero out of ten as of right now.

599
00:55:34,296 --> 00:55:35,476
Good for forty

600
00:55:35,816 --> 00:55:39,436
first place out of over forty thousand eight hundred

601
00:55:39,816 --> 00:55:40,856
Disney comics.

602
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:47,443
This is our first top fifty sorting. In fact, out of the five hundred some Barks stories. This is

603
00:55:48,102 --> 00:55:53,451
top. This is the top thirty second of all the Barks and the top forty first

604
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:58,618
overall. So we're a high into the ninety nine point ninth percentile here.

605
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:00,652
This is a beloved box

606
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:04,101
adventure that really does set the tone for a lot of the stories.

607
00:56:04,596 --> 00:56:05,735
That are gonna follow.

608
00:56:06,274 --> 00:56:07,213
Any any other

609
00:56:07,872 --> 00:56:10,530
thoughts about just the sort of,

610
00:56:10,949 --> 00:56:17,433
you know, how the story is before I talk about some other reflections and how it holds up and the other media.

611
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,168
Yeah. It's just...

612
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:32,087
Like I can tell, it was very well thought out. And it's not like trophy. You know what I mean? It's not like oh, this this old thing again. And they switched bodies because they both touched a mystical object at the same time or whatever like,

613
00:56:33,179 --> 00:56:34,398
This is a really interesting

614
00:56:35,335 --> 00:56:41,543
narrative. You know. And and I think it tells it really well. Yeah. I agree. It's it's set on a good

615
00:56:42,056 --> 00:56:44,948
it just has such a good setup and a good flow.

616
00:56:45,764 --> 00:56:51,288
I would say that this one also holds up very well. You know there's not really a lot that's

617
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,495
kind of retro grade or problematic

618
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:54,492
about it.

619
00:56:54,989 --> 00:57:05,686
You know, I I guess this is before kind of the stranger danger era where I think you know, people would probably look in a scans set a kidnapping plot like this. But...

620
00:57:06,066 --> 00:57:19,225
But in general, this this holds up very well. The only thing that's kind of archaic is kind of our understanding of of middle English. Right? I don't know if you're aware of this, but the use of y, do you know why that's historically

621
00:57:19,526 --> 00:57:20,005
incorrect?

622
00:57:20,526 --> 00:57:21,026
Yes.

623
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:22,586
It's because

624
00:57:23,126 --> 00:57:49,346
there was a the letter thorn. Right, it that is to make the the the sound at the beginning of the word the. And when it's written, it looks to our modern like a y and so you and I happening upon it would look at it and say, oh, that looks like a y. And so we we thought that everyone was talking like that back then, but they would said the or the the way we do and and written down in a way that looks like a. Exactly. That's exactly right. Very well said

625
00:57:49,725 --> 00:57:52,146
And so you, we have a lot of like European

626
00:57:52,485 --> 00:57:54,386
and other international listeners.

627
00:57:55,326 --> 00:58:13,056
And and I'm I'm curious how they represent in the translation sort of this of speech. But this is sort of signaling to us when we see yi old we know that it's supposed to be a little tiny. But really it would be pronounced the old. And in my own kind of mental gymnastics for justifying this,

628
00:58:13,828 --> 00:58:19,466
I would say that over the generations as the there's been this sort of passing on this burden,

629
00:58:20,615 --> 00:58:28,266
that, you know, maybe one of the kids was taught out of a book or something. And he could've have made that kind of mistake and started to pass on

630
00:58:28,659 --> 00:58:29,758
the old yee

631
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:31,932
speed speaking.

632
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:41,455
So anyway, that's true. Yeah. This is not actually a figure from the sixteen hundreds. He he played a game of telephone for four hundred years. That's right. Is at the end of it.

633
00:58:42,135 --> 00:58:42,635
Exactly.

634
00:58:43,695 --> 00:58:50,930
So appearances in other media, as I mentioned, this was a story that Barks did do an oil painting for.

635
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:55,778
It's well worth looking up. It's it's beautiful. It shows the man

636
00:58:56,593 --> 00:58:57,093
walking

637
00:58:57,431 --> 00:59:01,019
of the out of the sea behind the Ducktales

638
00:59:01,058 --> 00:59:04,005
about to strike and it's a very

639
00:59:04,463 --> 00:59:06,318
well known painting of his.

640
00:59:06,775 --> 00:59:08,072
I think he it was done in miniature.

641
00:59:08,968 --> 00:59:20,306
The one of the covers for this was net up imitation of that. I'll have to share that one with you and I'll put it up on the Facebook page. I'm not aware of any other use of the Armored man or any references and Ducktales or anything.

642
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:27,160
I did see... I I consider this one to be a very educational one in some ways, you know, just learning about

643
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,532
Kelp being turned into iodine

644
00:59:29,989 --> 00:59:30,489
was

645
00:59:30,986 --> 00:59:37,587
educational for me. I saw some of the mechanics of how tides worked in this. A lot of those great nautical terms

646
00:59:38,418 --> 00:59:46,991
Some of the archaic terms that are used are actually accurate. I like the use of, like how be it as an ad adverb in the English.

647
00:59:48,401 --> 00:59:50,494
So again, this is just a masterpiece.

648
00:59:51,509 --> 00:59:54,696
Do you want to nominate a favorite panel?

649
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,645
Or talk about any of them as your choice.

650
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,434
I think I think my favorite panel

651
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:03,843
might be when

652
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:06,475
Donald goes up to the hatch with his

653
01:00:07,052 --> 01:00:13,630
road spray loaded up in his squirt gun and the hatch pops open with the armored man and his blender bus He kind of

654
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,890
consumes the front half of Donald face with it.

655
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:17,270
Donald

656
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:30,516
is halfway halfway into the end of the blind bus there. And says, oh, I expected you to pop up with a sword. I just like the just kind of the... He is in mortal danger, but he's still not losing losing his

657
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:34,483
his senses, you know, he's still in kind of control of the situation.

658
01:00:34,981 --> 01:00:38,554
He was surprised. He's a little off balance. He's gonna figure out how to recover from this.

659
01:00:39,491 --> 01:00:48,547
Yeah. I I really like your favorite panel choices. You have some of the, like, less conventional ones. You know, I'm very drawn towards the show panels

660
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:49,520
And

661
01:00:50,221 --> 01:00:55,721
I really do have to go with the ones that are obvious, you know, the one with the Armored man

662
01:00:56,100 --> 01:01:11,246
illuminated after he gets off the ship for the first time. It's it's very show. It screams to to be recognized, but I'm I'm a sucker for that panel. And then, you know, as you heard me wax on about the

663
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:26,490
the octopus erupting from the ship, that that is another great one. But... And this would be when the when the three of them try to look down the cavern Al the same time when do shouts up and they Al plugged their heads together. That's was pretty good. Yeah. That's a fun moment. Excellent.

664
01:01:27,587 --> 01:01:35,152
Well, thank you again so much for joining me for this one. I'm glad. I'm glad that you've got a new favorite. This one

665
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:37,926
is now the highest rated

666
01:01:38,306 --> 01:01:40,166
that we have talked about.

667
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:44,577
I don't think it's going be for very long because we're about to enter

668
01:01:44,914 --> 01:01:45,574
kind of

669
01:01:46,348 --> 01:01:50,714
a very classic very rich period of Barks work. But

670
01:01:51,225 --> 01:01:53,520
Yeah, there's a lot to look forward to here.

671
01:01:54,217 --> 01:01:55,515
Coming up next

672
01:01:55,852 --> 01:01:58,201
episode, we are gonna be talking about

673
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:01,315
adventure down under. And

674
01:02:02,292 --> 01:02:07,241
again, to to listeners, I'm I'm just really grateful. I've gotten some nice notes recently.

675
01:02:08,055 --> 01:02:12,905
About the show and we are picking up some steam and getting a lot of international

676
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:27,686
listeners. And I'm just I'm so grateful for every one who gives this a listen. So again, thanks for joining us. If you have any thoughts or comments, you can drop us a line of Barks remarks at g dot com. You can also find us on Facebook
