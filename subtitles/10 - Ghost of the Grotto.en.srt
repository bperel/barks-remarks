00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,035
Hello, and welcome back to Barks remarks,

4
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:55,371
everyone. I am still Barks Sever.

5
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:57,865
A grown man who has

6
00:00:58,205 --> 00:01:04,265
managed to con some friends into letting him talk about his favorite comic stories

7
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,896
in the guise of actually releasing it as a podcast.

8
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:16,136
Don't tell them, but at any rate, I am joined by my guess toast, Ryan, if you can say hi to good people?

9
00:01:16,813 --> 00:01:22,315
Hello, everyone. I'm Ryan Bailey. This is my voice. And I am easily influenced by my friends.

10
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:24,506
Well, yes. Definitely.

11
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:29,453
So Ryan, today, we get to talk about

12
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:34,965
a a favorite comment of mine. I'm I'm very excited to get to this one.

13
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:40,799
I've been looking forward to it for a while, we will be covering Barks ghost of the g,

14
00:01:41,137 --> 00:01:42,277
this is

15
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:51,529
an adventure story that was published in July of nineteen forty seven. In four color number one hundred and fifty nine.

16
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:55,076
It has, of course, been reprinted many times.

17
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:58,141
This one is twenty six pages

18
00:01:59,116 --> 00:01:59,616
and

19
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:03,442
I I thought about it, and I would like to start

20
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:04,374
asking

21
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:07,408
you the c hosts to give us

22
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:09,005
your own synopsis

23
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:13,196
of the story since I do most of these

24
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,470
narration. So let's let's hear it. What how would you sum up ghost of the g?

25
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,530
So Donald and the nephews are

26
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:32,375
struggling to Harvest Kelp. And in the process of that, they and hear Al legend of a kidnapping of a small boy that happens every fifty years

27
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,349
the Inducks dismissed it, of course, and

28
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,450
later on, and they're harvesting happen upon a circular reef,

29
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,489
inside which they hope is an untapped kelp forest.

30
00:02:42,383 --> 00:02:47,253
Trying to get over the reef during high tide, they run a ground on it and discover the sunken rec of an ancient Al

31
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,085
Al octopus kaiju apparently lives inside the wrecked.

32
00:02:51,780 --> 00:03:00,700
Sure enough. Dewey is kidnapped by an armored man in the night while they sleep on their boat. Donald and the other nephews find the armored kid napa who talks like a shakespeare character,

33
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:07,665
Inducks cavern inside the reef and engage in deadly Ski to get dewey back or to signal for help from the town on the Main Island.

34
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:10,912
They overcome the octopus kaiju And the armored man,

35
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:20,325
The armored man revealed to be the latest in a line of boys, kidnapped and raised by their kit kidnapped. To guard a chest of gold intended for sir francis drake and her majesty.

36
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:27,486
Donald is given praise by the town on the island, and the formerly armored man gets the ancient and gold and some hamburgers.

37
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:29,643
Excellent.

38
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:31,601
Very capable synopsis.

39
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:36,295
I like that you referred to the octopus as a kaiju.

40
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:38,635
Tell us what the kaiju you is, please.

41
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:42,203
Ridiculously large monster like Godzilla z.

42
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:44,698
This is the octopus version of God.

43
00:03:45,196 --> 00:03:47,812
Yes, the opt version of God, definitely.

44
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:50,964
That was great. Thank you very much.

45
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:52,104
So

46
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,664
a little bit of background

47
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:55,124
about this story.

48
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:12,925
I I didn't check into this, but to me, it feels like Barks is kinda picking up his pace here because this was published just a couple of months after his previous pair of it adventure stories. And this is gonna be another of those that has two full length adventures next steps so we'll talk about adventure down under.

49
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:15,238
But this one gets the coveted

50
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:16,956
cover

51
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:20,172
for for this pair of stories for this issue.

52
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,884
There is a little bit of of

53
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:26,357
of detail in an interview that Barks did

54
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:31,626
about this one. So in in his words, he said that this story was a rare example

55
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,751
Ducktales that was conceived as a ten pager

56
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:38,817
for walt disney comics and stories, the the short

57
00:04:39,194 --> 00:04:39,694
gag

58
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:57,689
publication. And it grew into a longer story for donald Inducks. He said I can remember the first idea I had on that was just trying to figure out something to donald we could do. I thought of him sailing boats and came up with a potential ten pages of gathering c and selling this help, which would give me a lot of gigs with boats.

59
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:04,685
As I developed more and more things with the story, I think it's quite possible that the ghost of the g is brought in as a jimenez.

60
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:11,319
There is so much in that. I couldn't have thought of it in a whole bucket full of writing at once. And I I think that probably

61
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:19,205
bears out in the story ryan because this one does seem like it is a little bit of a sequence of kind of improbable things that happen

62
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:22,950
But but for me, this one just really works,

63
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:33,596
and that's gonna... The gonna stem from the underlying kind of mystery structure that he's gonna develop at the beginning of it. But before we get more into it just a little more background

64
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:36,760
Barks was inspired as he often is by Al nash

65
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:38,397
geographic article

66
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:40,969
about treasure Hunting and a ship rack.

67
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,861
The Treasure salvage apparently cut a hole in the side

68
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:51,355
like the one that the armored man exits from. And they they didn't find any treasure, but he was able to envision

69
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:53,175
this and kind of run with it.

70
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,270
I noted that this is one of his titles that has a nice use of Al moderation.

71
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,103
Bark is gonna tend to do that a lot. In his stories going forward.

72
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:13,305
And the the very well known editor Jeffrey Blu has called this one one of has landmark stories. I think that's because it kinda has that modest beginning

73
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:16,221
that sets up something much more

74
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,985
fancy. As far as the value, this one, you know, we're in that arrow, where these

75
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:37,221
reprint or the original printing rather go for quite a bit of money. So the highest documented at sale was in very good condition for this one. It's nine point six was sold for seven thousand five hundred dollars. And then, Ryan, you know that I I like to go into

76
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,256
sort of the historical background or the geographical

77
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:46,829
context for these stories. That's a big part of what interests me. So I want you to

78
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:49,389
buckle up for fifteen minutes

79
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:52,404
about health gathering. Oh, excellent.

80
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:52,784
Yeah.

81
00:06:54,064 --> 00:07:09,634
No. I... I'm not gonna talk about that too much, but I I did I did look it up, and I did find it really interesting to find out that, you know, this is Al thing. This is apparently is where I comes from, this is the easiest way to get today. Yes.

82
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:14,170
Apparently, this is still the easiest way to get, like, commercial grade iodine.

83
00:07:15,748 --> 00:07:18,939
I happen to live near one of the one of the world's premier

84
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:20,735
aquariums

85
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:25,719
where I learned that a kelp can grow a foot a day that's some amazing. So

86
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:28,090
if if you wanna gather a crop this a good crop.

87
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:33,680
Yeah. So a little bit just a little bit on the history of that. Iodine

88
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,935
was first extracted from seaweed in eighteen eleven.

89
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:44,206
This is something that gets used for a lot of different reasons, including treating some health conditions.

90
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:45,822
I also

91
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:55,465
actually thought about the title and wondered if people would know what a g is. Do you know the, like, true definition of a g ryan? I like I do. I think of it is

92
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:09,674
like any kind of under water cave? Yeah. That... That's right. Technically, it's much more expensive. It can be really any cave and I think the official definition says that it doesn't have to be, you know, under underwater or

93
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:19,240
submit to water, but that's in practice. That is how we use it. We usually talk about, like, caves that are just underwater or or right nearby water.

94
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:21,827
So, yes, the g itself

95
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,225
of course, is gonna be the underground hideout out of the armored man.

96
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:35,630
So for notable appearances in this one, I've already named dropped the armored man. We don't ever learn his actual name. I don't believe.

97
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:45,185
There's no no one else other than the docs that's really noteworthy in this one. I've started to talk about kind of what version of the characters

98
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:50,355
of the characters we're getting in these stories now. And to me, this is sort of the resourceful

99
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:54,530
version of Donald. You know, he's very level headed than this one for the most part.

100
00:08:55,305 --> 00:08:58,205
He's very determined once Dewey disappears

101
00:08:58,665 --> 00:09:08,840
to get him back. You know, he he never really loses his head in this one, which is not very typical for donald. It's true. So we're gonna go over our

102
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:11,644
detailing of the story And

103
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:19,515
again, as always Ryan, feel free to chime in. But the... This story opens up with a really cool splash panel

104
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:21,927
and an explanation of

105
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:27,314
summary of setting up where they are. They're They're in the west Inducks

106
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:34,285
they have a boat. And as Ryan Al mentioned they've got their own sea gathering business.

107
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,640
So the first page has them...

108
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,560
It shows sort of their day to day harvesting help harvesting c.

109
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:51,615
And what I found notable about this is that Barks really... I think goes into some nice detail with the artwork. He shows this kind of the mechanics.

110
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:55,438
Of the kelp gathering with the win and the

111
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:59,801
the tongs or whatever the the pictures that they use to harvest it.

112
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:24,368
And they're just talking about their business in general. They they've been talking about how the the beds... The Sea beds are playing out and they're getting less and less. And on their way back, they mentioned that there's a lot of Ce to be gathered in the center of skull i reef. If they could only get to it. And so that kinda sets it up. They passed the reef, Ryan, how would you describe the reef?

113
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:27,260
It's it's pretty small. And

114
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:34,492
it's a perfect circle like a donut. So there's water in the center and while all around it and then it's just this

115
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:35,529
mound

116
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:37,780
that it that goes all the way around on broken.

117
00:10:38,314 --> 00:10:45,455
Right. And they set it up so that whatever is in the middle of that, you know, you can't really access Al all and they know that there's a ton of Al

118
00:10:46,230 --> 00:11:01,451
in the center. There's a really neat little site gag that Bark has of a very busy bird on the win that Donald is turning. I I like to note that Barks really likes these site guys and I think that they're starting to become a little bit more common

119
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:02,627
as he goes.

120
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:06,075
Alright. And sitting you're looking at it, I didn't even notice the bird.

121
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:15,812
Yeah. And and and keep an eye out for these site gigs because again, he he really does have a lot of fun with those. And then, you know, a lot of people

122
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,447
would say that Dawn Roses is is kind of the spiritual

123
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:20,286
successor

124
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,815
to Barb, there there are a lot of people who would probably take issue with that. But

125
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:30,545
he did a lot of sequels to these stories, and he kind of carries that. Tradition on and

126
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:32,485
maybe expands on it.

127
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:42,507
So on the next page, you know, the that's kind of right off the possibility of getting the kelp from Skull i reef. And they head back to the island

128
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:45,035
that they seemed to be headquartered from

129
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:46,114
And

130
00:11:47,212 --> 00:12:00,560
I I wanna take a a brief moment to kind of acknowledge that the island that they're on It's it's a really interesting place. Right? Because box goes out of his way to depict this very, like, multi multicultural

131
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,644
mix, like a launch of accents. There's some, like, Caribbean

132
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:06,801
accents

133
00:12:07,178 --> 00:12:08,396
and some French

134
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:10,328
or cajun and accent

135
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:24,037
and some, like, Mexican or Spanish, and there's a guy who looks very rich. So The the reason that I really wanted to go out of my way to highlight that is that we're about to enter into

136
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,650
a series of stories.

137
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:37,345
Many of which are all time classic but we we kind of also happen to be heading into sort of a rough patch. As well where there gonna be some pretty unfortunate

138
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:38,385
depictions

139
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:39,865
and and characters.

140
00:12:40,165 --> 00:13:01,315
So I did wanna highlight that Barks is very capable of, you know, depicting this kind of this kind of setting and I liked that a lot. But the the interesting thing the dots are really focused on their their job and what they're trying to do with the seaweed, and they don't notice that all in the background, there are these, like very ominous

141
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,370
rumbling, people talking about

142
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:10,704
a really terrible event that would means that everyone is every

143
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,458
conversation is about the need to keep

144
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:23,500
their children locked up somewhere safe. And it's very ominous tonight is the night. They repeat that a couple of times. Tonight is the night french

145
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,900
one man says to another

146
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,840
tonight day the night, Tony.

147
00:13:28,294 --> 00:14:11,940
Another says, and we're gonna wanna remember that line. And so by the end of this page, Donald has come to terms with the fact. That, you know, the only way to get this help is the dangerous way, which he's motivated to. I didn't mention that they they learned that the price of kelp has shot up yet again. I also noticed how he seem to make a point of where like, everybody's from a different country kind of I... The guy the guy who's kind of tying them up when they reach the doc seems kind of American to me. Then we have french accent sent a Spanish accent. This guy in the helmet this guy with a kind of a umbrella looking thing. Right. Yeah. Yeah. It's felt very naturally multi multicultural. Alright. So on the next page, the dots are talking about their plans to go out and some old

148
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,555
sea hand a sailor at the dock over here them, and he, you know, he's he's

149
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:32,546
gas. He's asking Donald, you know, you're not planning to leave your kids un bombarded tonight. Are you? Donald has no idea what he's referring to and he tells him, but but tonight, maybe, tonight is the night. So we're getting this ominous through line

150
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:33,423
again

151
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:46,655
and and he reveals that the reason everyone is talking is that tonight is the night that somebody's little boy will be stolen. And Donald very naturally wants to get some more information about this.

152
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:54,161
And Huey, he pumps him for information. And the guy just every question Donald asks, who's doing it, why?

153
00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:56,435
Why tonight,

154
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:59,915
he keeps responding nobody knows. And,

155
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:03,729
you know, Donald kind of writes him off but another

156
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:09,500
old salt, another sale comes up and and comes to clarify more information.

157
00:15:10,473 --> 00:15:14,286
He's got a bit of a an accent that maybe be Caribbean

158
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:15,204
or

159
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:23,326
or Latino of some kind. All I know is that when I was seven and I read, you have not heard of Eats mystery.

160
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:29,100
I was confused. I didn't get that it was its mystery. I thought there was something called Eats mystery.

161
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:33,522
Yeah. The first guy, the first guy has, like, a pipe and a cap feels like

162
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:37,429
feels like new newfoundland main or something like that.

163
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:54,998
Of an old, you know, see. Yeah. It looks like with that. Really cloth fish or something. Yeah. There you go. And then the the last guy looks I guess some stripes on his sleeve. He looks like maybe a captain or something. Yeah. Like you say, everyone looks like they're from somewhere else on this Caribbean Island. Alright. So

164
00:15:55,336 --> 00:15:55,836
this...

165
00:15:56,214 --> 00:16:00,145
The second guy, he does a better job of explaining. He

166
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:06,822
tells about the kind of the curse really of this island is that every fifty years

167
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,976
on this night

168
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:12,920
a little boy has been stolen and has never seen again.

169
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:16,692
This is that's happened seven times

170
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:31,314
since the century when the first one disappeared. And, you know, Donald rightfully is like, well, man, you need to do something about it. And he explained that their their way of doing something about it is locking their little kids up and watching them carefully.

171
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:40,535
And Donald is not concerned because he tells him, you know, no one's gonna come for him out on skull eye reef where we're going.

172
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:47,950
Before the Ducktales off, one of the nephews asks if there's ever been any clue about who's doing with stealing.

173
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:49,865
And the

174
00:16:50,285 --> 00:17:04,622
the old sailor explains that the only clue from a long time ago is a footprint of an armored man. And, you know, this is a moment of surprise for the nephews as they wonder, you know, are there nights in these

175
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:12,687
and one of the nephews makes the comment that nights haven't been seen. Armor hasn't been worn around here since the days of the Al.

176
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:17,297
And I liked the Barks kind of snuck that in fore shadow a little bit.

177
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:33,725
Yeah. Yeah. My... I had a like, a medium brown moments on this page. Thinking, you know, what what is the difference between a footprint of an armored foot versus like, a boot if you had like a horse riding boots? Oh, yeah. That look different in the mud.

178
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:49,135
So maybe there could be a some impression in the in the metal by the the crafter Right. It. Yeah. Maybe her manager these sealed or something like that. So the interesting thing between these two pages to me is that now we're leaving this island

179
00:17:49,515 --> 00:17:53,903
and the rest of this story is gonna take place almost entirely

180
00:17:54,321 --> 00:18:00,064
on skull i reef. You know, it's not not quite a bottle episode, but it is really

181
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:06,835
interesting to me that he's able to get so much out of this setting. Because the dots returned to the reef.

182
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:17,242
And by the time they get there, it's high tide. And this is kind of transformed the reef because the little peaks of it are just poking out as though it's like a little

183
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,678
chain circular islands chain.

184
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:22,116
And they

185
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:27,603
they see some channels that have been formed that almost look big enough to flow back into.

186
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:29,920
Donald picks one to try

187
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:30,814
and,

188
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:39,185
you know, feels lucky, and they they basically let a wave pick them up and deposit them with a big thud.

189
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,259
Halfway

190
00:18:40,718 --> 00:18:49,010
onto the reef. Far enough that they can manage their win, they're their pictures to get in and gather the kill. Yeah. Yeah. So

191
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:52,535
would been pretty concerned about that, but apparently, Donald does not.

192
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,366
Yeah. Especially with a rental

193
00:18:55,703 --> 00:18:56,101
boat.

194
00:18:57,656 --> 00:19:02,043
Yeah. So... But man, he really wants that that's wants that

195
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,015
count. Yeah. Good stuff in there. Yep.

196
00:19:05,973 --> 00:19:07,725
And and the extra dollar on

197
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:12,990
I wanted to kinda highlight the two panels that, you know, where the boat gets lifted.

198
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:26,571
I think the water rushing pass the boat looks really neat and then the the thud that they land with is really well drawn i I like that lot. So... Yeah. Yeah. You can kinda see the the way it's flashing up above the the mcdonald's there and

199
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,343
There's definitely some force

200
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:39,030
here. Right. Yeah. I think it... I think it conveys that movement really well on the the weight of the boat. So on the next page, they're they're on their Mary Way. They are

201
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,050
getting as much Al as they possibly can.

202
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:46,077
The Nephews are enjoying seeing a

203
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:59,006
version of fifteen men on the dead man's chest. It's fifteen Barks articles on the Captain's chest. And as the tide goes down, they start to see a little bit more in the interior of the reef

204
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:00,122
and they

205
00:20:00,795 --> 00:20:10,225
get a really big pile. They get their tongs onto to a big pile of kelp and try to quote yank, the whole mess board. And they see something

206
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:22,298
underneath the pile of kelp, and it it's revealed to be part of a ship So the docs perceived to yank more and more of the kelp until we cut to a panel at the bottom of this page,

207
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:26,527
and they've cleared it, and they see that the ship is...

208
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:34,052
Donald says it's an old gal, and one of the nephew says, or it's a British manor war. Pointing out the gun ports.

209
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,367
No. I think it's... I think it's pretty cool.

210
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:42,610
The way you know, we're kind of investigating escalating we've already gotten a little bit of the mystery, but now we're escalating the...

211
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,930
you know, what what's going on here

212
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:54,559
and kind of setting up our the conditions of the bottle that we're gonna be in for the rest of the the issue. Yeah. Definitely. I think there's some really good sort of table setting here.

213
00:20:55,878 --> 00:21:05,052
And I I wanna really note that this is just to me, this panel is gorgeous. The way he's drawn this old ship, yeah. It's half sunk and it looks

214
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:08,615
very detailed. As does the reef, I think this one

215
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,095
would be instantly

216
00:21:11,595 --> 00:21:12,095
recognizable

217
00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:12,934
to

218
00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:15,630
long time Barks fans. Is a very

219
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,107
beautiful panel.

220
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:22,057
And then, of course, we're gonna realize that it is the nephew that's right

221
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:32,044
that it must be a British manor war base on the Al of the rm and man that we haven't met yet. Mh. Alright. So on the next page, they decide to

222
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,615
explore the ship.

223
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:35,809
And

224
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,650
Donald

225
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,370
takes a raft over

226
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,169
hops onto to the deck, which

227
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,410
is revealed to be rotten immediately

228
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,900
after and if Huey, warned him, he crashes through into the hall.

229
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,059
The nephews

230
00:21:50,638 --> 00:21:53,175
toss him line and donald scratches

231
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:57,594
down in the hold, and as he's pulled up an immense

232
00:21:58,072 --> 00:21:59,587
Octopus Technical on,

233
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:01,340
snakes up after him.

234
00:22:01,913 --> 00:22:02,413
And

235
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:03,509
Ducktales

236
00:22:04,107 --> 00:22:05,644
from the ship

237
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:07,798
indicate that there's just a massive

238
00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:14,223
octopus in there. And one of the Nephews says a great line. He cats is all that one octopus.

239
00:22:14,822 --> 00:22:20,405
This is at least the third point in the comic where they use some some phrase that I've never heard anyone used before.

240
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:24,548
And sentinel to know how much of it is is

241
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:35,794
Disney corn and how much of it is how people actually talk about that? Yeah. I think it's a little a call may and a little bit of call and b. I mean, some of these are just kind of like, forties and fifties speak.

242
00:22:36,094 --> 00:22:36,594
But

243
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:37,474
if

244
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:45,889
growing up at this time, this this is like almost my word balloons. Right? I would have mentally say he cats to myself

245
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:49,789
a couple of times a week because I was so steep in reading these Barks.

246
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:56,151
Stories. So I was a kid in the late eighties and and early nineties with this kind of, like, mental vocabulary.

247
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,886
So we've got kind of the this other

248
00:22:59,319 --> 00:22:59,819
background

249
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:09,474
now set up with this giant octopus. And on the next page, you know, the duct acknowledged that, okay, we're not... Obviously, we're not exploring that anymore.

250
00:23:09,774 --> 00:23:11,434
And night falls,

251
00:23:12,214 --> 00:23:21,569
and there's just a generally creepy vibe for the ducks on the boat. As they get ready to go to bed. The nephews have kind of talked themselves into feeling spooked

252
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:25,304
because earlier in the day, of course, they heard all of this tail

253
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:27,955
of the ghost kid kidnapping kids,

254
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:33,815
and then they've just encountered this weird ship and the octopus. So they're rightfully fully creeped out.

255
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:35,886
And then we

256
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:41,514
transition to a couple of really nice nighttime panels Scrooge and silhouette

257
00:23:41,852 --> 00:23:42,791
of the

258
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:45,664
of the ship rack and Barks

259
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:50,460
in a in a narrative box, he says that the moon

260
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:58,075
rides once more above the haul of the ancient man war. And we cut to the deck where the door creek ominous

261
00:23:58,412 --> 00:23:58,890
open.

262
00:23:59,424 --> 00:24:05,325
And indeed an armored man steps out of it and says tonight is unite.

263
00:24:05,963 --> 00:24:13,590
And this is another just really. To me. It's stunning panel. I I love the slow setup of this and the ominous.

264
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:20,645
Creek of the door. And the way that he's drawn and realized and the way the the light glimpse off of his armor

265
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:22,925
and his sword is

266
00:24:23,225 --> 00:24:24,125
very memorable.

267
00:24:24,465 --> 00:24:24,785
To me.

268
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:29,607
Yeah. And the his face is still totally obscured except for

269
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,141
his eyes.

270
00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:34,930
As we know Cartoon character's eyes are always visible even in the dark.

271
00:24:35,665 --> 00:24:41,905
So so we're still getting some mystery here. You know. He's he's spoken and he's appeared. So we know he's not just a story.

272
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:44,135
That the island just still themselves.

273
00:24:44,673 --> 00:25:02,696
But we still don't know anything about even, like, what kind of animal he is necessarily. Also, it wasn't until this reread just now as we're doing this podcast that I noticed the scale on the moon face as the moon is rising above Yeah. That's right. And and that one I've seen mentioned in a couple of write ups Sparks usually kind of,

274
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:17,380
you know, avoids these, like, ci site gag during serious moments, but it is a little moment of of levi during this kind creepy moment. And I wonder if he, like talked himself into it because this is a very

275
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,340
deeply

276
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,115
creepy

277
00:25:19,573 --> 00:25:23,680
story. Right? Like, this is a a generational sort of kidnapping.

278
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:32,295
And so, you know, I don't know. Maybe he was just having some fun with it or maybe he wanted to diffuse it a little bit. So on the next page,

279
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:34,532
it's now the crack of Dawn

280
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:44,676
and the duct are getting ready for the days business. They've gotta get the ship ready to float back at the right tight again. Donald is giving orders

281
00:25:45,014 --> 00:25:47,270
to his nephews on how to get ready.

282
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:53,430
We get some pretty good nautical speak here. You know. He and instruct Huey, to start the engine, loo to oil the lynch.

283
00:25:54,007 --> 00:26:01,403
And then dewey is told to stand by the caps and keep the anchor chains str. I don't think I could tell you what that means.

284
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:04,814
And then Dewey does not respond

285
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:11,287
and, you know, the audience is immediately figured out that he must have been taken, but Donald is

286
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:13,919
searching for his his lazy nephew

287
00:26:14,655 --> 00:26:19,996
until one of the nephews thanks to step off the boat onto the little,

288
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,791
you know, at hole or

289
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:28,155
i part of the wreath that they're on and he sees the tracks of an armored man.

290
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:29,715
Again, I noticed

291
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:32,235
Al as we get the caption

292
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:38,070
the first crack of dawn, it shows the sun just below it rising above the water with the word. Crack. Yes.

293
00:26:39,150 --> 00:27:04,972
Yeah. Thanks for pointing that out. That's another of those kind of note site gag that's always stated in this. And it's just another little fun moment of levi. There's also a a pretty funny looking bird again in the background. I'm I'm figuring out doing these reread now and really focused on the art. That Barks just loved to draw birds or at least during this year. Yeah. That's that's evidence like Barks, any, likes some

294
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:07,469
terminology as you've noticed. Right.

295
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:17,318
Alright. And so on the next page, you know, Donald has instantly clocked that something's wrong. There might be something to the kidnapping story. So,

296
00:27:17,815 --> 00:27:22,845
you know, they follow the tracks as far as they can that they disappear into the waves. It's been erased.

297
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:24,485
And then Donald,

298
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:25,805
very sen,

299
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:33,870
says that, you know, he must have been taken back to the island because, like, what other alternative really would there be.

300
00:27:34,962 --> 00:27:39,506
But one of the nephews, wonders, if the armored man could have come from the old ship.

301
00:27:40,104 --> 00:27:44,286
Donald points out that, you know, most of the time that completely under underwater.

302
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:51,841
And the nephews used rightfully for kids who have just, you know, realized one of their brothers is missing. Wonder if it's a ghost.

303
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:52,915
And

304
00:27:53,653 --> 00:27:54,153
Donald

305
00:27:54,812 --> 00:28:00,605
says, you know, Fo, he had to come from the island, they're gonna go back and tear the place apart.

306
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:14,111
And then one of the nephews catches that they can't go back because the large hole has been gouging in the ship, and it might have been caused by a sword. And Condolences says were trapped in his bottle episode until we resolved the conflict.

307
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,959
He didn't really say that. It was implied. It was implied. Absent.

308
00:28:20,895 --> 00:28:21,874
Alright. So...

309
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:34,300
Yeah. So we're just getting some some good clothes. The flip footsteps that go down to just below the surface of the water and then disappear. That either his strikes were washed away or that was his destination. Right. Exactly.

310
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:40,504
So the Ducktales are realizing that they're pretty well stuck. And Donald is getting

311
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:46,541
more nervous about, you know, the possibility that maybe it is a ghost. He doesn't really know what's going on.

312
00:28:47,273 --> 00:28:52,319
But he is continuing to keep a pretty level head. You know, his next move is to radio,

313
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:55,867
the news to port and get help as quick as possible.

314
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,080
And then he realized that the

315
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,860
wires have been stripped off of the radio.

316
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,953
And, you know, the line there, he says that iron plated Scrooge

317
00:29:07,392 --> 00:29:09,291
stripped the wires off the radio.

318
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:10,968
There's a couple of other

319
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:16,137
moments in the... On this page. Where he's starting to use some pretty funny nickname

320
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:20,390
for, you know, he doesn't really know anything other than that he's Al armored man.

321
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:21,983
He says that

322
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:27,052
a guy that runs around in ten pants and a hot climate like this is capable of anything.

323
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:31,380
And and that was something that I picked up on this reading. He's got some pretty amusing

324
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:41,375
expressions for for the armored man. But he he they figure that he's probably... The the man probably used the wires to tie up dewey.

325
00:29:41,815 --> 00:29:44,115
So his next step is to ask

326
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:47,288
Huey, to lights some signal rockets,

327
00:29:47,907 --> 00:29:52,860
and he figures out that they were in the hold, which has been completely flooded with water.

328
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:54,372
Yeah. So

329
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:57,440
I like... I mean, this page seems to be just

330
00:29:58,216 --> 00:30:12,415
plugging plot holes. I'm just like, well, why didn't they just why don't they just radio for help or whatever and... Or send some rockets or whatever. And the fact that he probably used the i I would thought, you know, a soldier from four hundred years ago, certainly wouldn't know to

331
00:30:12,715 --> 00:30:13,575
destroy their radio

332
00:30:13,915 --> 00:30:15,135
so they can't get help.

333
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,750
But if he's just looking for something along and and durable to tie his

334
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,630
kidnapping and picked him up with, then

335
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:33,125
that makes sense. Yeah. I agree with you. I think this this page showed some care and that sort of... As you say, why didn't they this? Why didn't they this and a lot of creators

336
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:39,917
don't always take the time. And in some stories parks doesn't really take the time to kind of explain potential plot

337
00:30:40,413 --> 00:30:42,801
like that. Alright. So they're

338
00:30:43,297 --> 00:30:52,587
their next best hope then because they're logically going through their options is to light a signal fire. So Donald says they need to go to the highest

339
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:53,865
ridge

340
00:30:54,244 --> 00:31:00,735
on the reef and he tells the nephews to light it there. And the nephews used discover that there is a hole in that one.

341
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:01,995
And

342
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:05,435
one of the nephews used says that it sounds hollow

343
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:07,086
like, there's a big cavern

344
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:08,761
underneath or

345
00:31:09,098 --> 00:31:11,051
if you will, maybe A g.

346
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,269
And

347
00:31:12,646 --> 00:31:20,675
Donald is skeptical, but the nephew you says, well, i'll yell down in the hole and you'll hear it echo, and so he... He else hello? This is Louis,

348
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:22,555
and they here

349
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,608
Hello? This is Dewey,

350
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:27,864
and there's a a fun moment where the Ducktales

351
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:28,804
simultaneously

352
00:31:29,942 --> 00:31:39,195
lean in and clunky their heads together. And I thought it was a nice touch that they didn't really even express any pain from that. It's a good gag, but it just shows that they're really interested.

353
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:44,624
Focused on getting him back. Yeah. I'll also point out for the listeners

354
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:47,301
that the highest point on the reef is probably

355
00:31:47,815 --> 00:31:50,755
ten to fifteen feet high, and it's not an impressive peak.

356
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:53,635
But make very little difference. But...

357
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:54,135
Yeah.

358
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,330
I like... I like the the echo

359
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:05,662
the echo they expected was different. Was a nice touch. Yeah. I I thought that was a really good game. Alright. So they are...

360
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,356
They're figuring more and more stuff out.

361
00:32:09,114 --> 00:32:13,087
They they know now where he is, and you can kinda see them audibly

362
00:32:14,357 --> 00:32:19,815
exhale a little bit because they know that he's okay and they so they start to plan how they're gonna get down there.

363
00:32:21,225 --> 00:32:21,725
He...

364
00:32:22,385 --> 00:32:24,205
When when he has

365
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:25,725
tried to tell them,

366
00:32:26,025 --> 00:32:27,305
you know, the situation,

367
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:29,485
his voice gets muffled,

368
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,380
because the armored man has clearly claimed

369
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,160
it shut his mouth shut,

370
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,300
and

371
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:42,135
they decide to search the reef for another entrance, thinking that there's gotta to be a hole that's above the line.

372
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:47,890
But they're not able to find one. So Donald says that they're gonna make an entrance out of this one,

373
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:53,090
and they're gonna use their tongs on their boat to just yank the entrance open.

374
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,730
And Donald,

375
00:32:55,325 --> 00:33:00,699
closes by saying if you can get the tongs into old ten pants, will yank him out of there too,

376
00:33:01,357 --> 00:33:03,235
which thought was an awesome line.

377
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:04,987
This is part of the

378
00:33:05,324 --> 00:33:14,655
ingenuity that you pointed out the beginning of the episode where they're using the resources that are available to them. We're getting, you know, the clever donald and he's very determined and very

379
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:22,555
resourceful and level headed right in the crisis here. Alright. So by by the afternoon on the next page, they've expanded the whole enough to get down.

380
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:31,021
And, you know, the kids are wondering what she's planning on doing when he's lowered. They asked him, you know, you're not going in there unarmed and donald

381
00:33:31,415 --> 00:33:33,433
has... He's got a shot,

382
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,869
which he calls a twelve gauge can opener

383
00:33:37,408 --> 00:33:40,365
so that I can make a dent in that tin of sausage.

384
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:42,414
And I just... I love that line.

385
00:33:42,932 --> 00:33:44,987
Almost all the lines on this page are great.

386
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:49,310
You know, they're they're pretty nervous. They say that this is pretty risky.

387
00:33:50,085 --> 00:33:57,985
I like how determined Donald is here. He says I don't care if there's a found full of Sherman tanks. I'm going down. And then there's a sequence

388
00:33:58,285 --> 00:33:59,225
where he

389
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:07,580
He says lower me boys as he gets lowered by a line into the hole, and then when he gets down to the bottom of the hole,

390
00:34:08,034 --> 00:34:08,852
he sees

391
00:34:09,229 --> 00:34:15,126
the armored man is lighting an old Canon aimed directly up else h me boys.

392
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:18,511
And he narrowly avoids the canon fire

393
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:25,145
and, you know, they've gotta figure something else out. And again, this is just a great gag. It's it's

394
00:34:26,123 --> 00:34:40,941
exciting. It's funny. It's very well drawn. And in last frame for refers to the armored man is Al the boiler breach is Oh, yeah. Another another excellent nickname. Thank you for catching that old boiler breaches. And, unfortunately, Donald has dropped his

395
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:49,386
twelve twelve gauge can opener her as he as he was clam back up for his life. That's right. So, yeah, he he

396
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:50,880
the nephews...

397
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,400
He reminds the nephews that

398
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,620
they still need to light that signal fire.

399
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:05,035
But the man do as zip because he can reach it from here. And, you know, this is like, about the first time we're donald loses this is temper.

400
00:35:05,848 --> 00:35:09,299
Pretty impressive for Donald Duck, and he...

401
00:35:09,636 --> 00:35:16,430
If we've got another excellent nickname here, he says, that's not fair. Come out of your whole and fight you cast iron go for.

402
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:28,157
And and this is the nephews. The two nephews turned to kind of have a nice level head. They've got a really great plan here. They logically say, you know, he's he's really nervous.

403
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:40,671
He's scared about them bringing and reinforcements. So what they wanna do is they wanna light a signal i are much farther away, one that's gonna draw them out, draw him out, and then they'll try and grab him with the tongs.

404
00:35:41,368 --> 00:35:51,520
And before as they're lighting the signal fire, they see that the tide come out again and the old ship is now showing. Yeah. And and I think they have learned at this point that it's not a a whole

405
00:35:51,874 --> 00:35:54,329
a whole one farmer Men as one of the nephews

406
00:35:54,906 --> 00:35:55,406
speculated.

407
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:59,090
Right. Yeah. They know they've got a solitary component. So

408
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:03,421
They've got the upper hand on him as long as they can keep their head.

409
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:04,959
Alright? So

410
00:36:05,377 --> 00:36:13,791
this this story takes place over just a couple of days. We see a nice clear passage of time. We get night once again and the Ducktales are just

411
00:36:14,129 --> 00:36:14,629
staring

412
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:20,828
at the hole because they figured donald at least figures that know, that's the only way he can get out.

413
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:28,240
And one of the nephews is skeptical because he thinks he heard a creek on the old ship, but Donald is like, no.

414
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:31,505
Only the whole stair... Stare at the whole

415
00:36:31,961 --> 00:36:38,980
we see the Armored man is exiting from the ship and we see him take a little boat out

416
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,040
through a swinging door in the manor war,

417
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,381
and he uses some of that old English, she speak that sorta shakespeare ex

418
00:36:47,917 --> 00:37:01,401
fo ex with my trusty blade. I must Al for And he says Bonnie Queen best will night me for this nights work. Bonnie Queen best is a nickname for Elizabeth. And so that's how we we can be pretty sure that he's british.

419
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,777
And so Donald again says keep watching

420
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,430
in front of us,

421
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:13,710
and we get this pretty famous scene of the night onboarding the ship, very men

422
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:14,970
willing his sword.

423
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:16,804
Behind the docks.

424
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:19,281
This was used for the cover

425
00:37:20,379 --> 00:37:34,407
It Barks an oil of this scene. This is very icon I noticed this the armor man's first line on this page is beyond von boat ill. Yeah. I have no idea what that what that means. So there... If we have any four hundred year old listeners,

426
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,099
they can they can comment on your facebook page.

427
00:37:37,818 --> 00:37:42,241
We we can. Yes. I... I'll take a crack at it. Right? Y is just

428
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:43,836
they over theirs.

429
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:47,224
Yeah. Right. And I think Al is just to, like, a ras.

430
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:55,225
Okay. And, you know, boat ill is just Barks bearing you ill will, I think. But I think that this is really just the sort of like,

431
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:56,859
Robin hood

432
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,217
that audiences

433
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:00,594
from the forties would have expected.

434
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:08,633
Yeah. Alright. So fortunately, on the next page Donald gotten hungry and he asks for a tomato from their basket.

435
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:11,847
Finding it to be. Right. He toss it backwards

436
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:16,769
right into the armor man's face. He gives the old tiny

437
00:38:17,705 --> 00:38:18,883
swear odd

438
00:38:20,074 --> 00:38:25,403
which I'm not convinced anyone actually said. But apparently Al, like, one of those blasts for me

439
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,710
curse because it's like god's body. Like a a way of saying god's body.

440
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:31,769
And

441
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,890
they

442
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:42,264
they realized that he's behind them, the armored man, he takes us slice at them but misses and they have to scatter and hide themselves into the kelp

443
00:38:42,764 --> 00:39:10,205
the the iron man's very frustrated, but at least he can kick their fire, their fire into the c. And this is a very very quick, but action packed page that's very dramatic and satisfying. To me. Yeah. That's very visual. I like that Donald probably would have thrown around tomato went the guy's face if he had known the guy was there, but he accidentally did it anyway. A little happens stands. And, you know, I'm just noticing on this read through right now, how cool it is that the

444
00:39:10,543 --> 00:39:17,000
armored man is generally drawn in silhouette until the last panel of the page is he's kicking the fire, his...

445
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:34,344
The the glare of the fire really illuminate him neatly in a way that just looks very cool, artistic. Yeah. Alright there's a lot of detail on his armor. You can see all the little pieces on the on the arm. And there's different pieces on the chest and Right The helmet has little flares on it and...

446
00:39:34,924 --> 00:39:41,851
Yeah. Even the sword has kind of a an interesting hilt on it. There's it would've you quite a while to draw this guy and Severino.

447
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:51,997
Yeah. Exactly. And when you consider that he was doing two full length stories for this month's release, Alright. So on the next page, the Ducktales are regroup.

448
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:58,145
They figure out that he's left, and so they get back to their boat, and they cast a search light on him.

449
00:39:59,118 --> 00:40:00,336
Not finding him

450
00:40:00,674 --> 00:40:00,993
anywhere.

451
00:40:01,591 --> 00:40:11,603
And and then one of the nephews here is that Creek again, and he turns the light on to the ship, and they do finally see the armored man going into a hole in the stern,

452
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:21,390
which is the back of the boat. Right? I think I probably learned that from this one. Oh, I bad from getting my canoe advantage at age twelve. Excellent.

453
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:24,103
It's it's a.

454
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,100
The the Ducktales here are also

455
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:28,537
in mostly silhouette

456
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:49,427
for the the top half page. So we just get there. They're outlines and they're lit eyes, of course, and then and then kind of a cool shot with their. One of them holding that that kind of hook pike sort of thing they use for the kelvin one of them manning the search light. Yeah. That's right. It's a boat hook which I learned from last week episode or the the one previous care of the river.

457
00:40:50,344 --> 00:40:56,885
And and it's a cool panel too where they're turning the lights the bottom left panel where they're, like, partially

458
00:40:57,224 --> 00:41:10,513
illuminated and partially Yeah. Partially dark. And same thing with the the armored man. Alright. So they've they've realized they've pretty much figured everything out right now. Right? Donald snaps and it kind of represents the audience knowing everything.

459
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:11,885
So

460
00:41:12,385 --> 00:41:17,805
finally, now that we've got everything, I think Barks decides that we can flash down into

461
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:22,375
the armored man's hideout out where he's loading. He's reloading his

462
00:41:22,874 --> 00:41:23,734
old tiny

463
00:41:24,313 --> 00:41:24,813
gun

464
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:32,422
and talking with dewey who refers to him as jingle joints and what a mess of trouble he got himself in when he kid kidnapped him.

465
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:34,170
And

466
00:41:34,668 --> 00:41:37,760
the arm man says verily they they say at the,

467
00:41:38,257 --> 00:41:43,480
another line that I really like. And so they lied another signal fire. They're getting ready for the morning.

468
00:41:43,854 --> 00:41:54,338
And Donald says, okay. Well, now we we know we've got to get past the ship so we've gotta think of a way to get past the off to octopus. And by the time low tide comes around, one of the f fuse Hue

469
00:41:54,957 --> 00:41:57,296
says that he's got a plan. He's rolling

470
00:41:57,635 --> 00:42:14,145
a large slab of meat full to the brim with Chili pepper. Saying that that will get rid of the octopus. Seems like a good plan. It does. Yeah. I also like that line from the armored man. It was good. Just like man, this is a lot harder than it was fifty years ago and a hundred years ago.

471
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:17,640
Old time speak for you're you're not kidding.

472
00:42:18,894 --> 00:42:19,294
Yeah. Yeah.

473
00:42:20,174 --> 00:42:20,674
Also,

474
00:42:21,054 --> 00:42:25,515
this issue provides some practical knowledge on how to def defeat kaiju you if ever you're

475
00:42:26,094 --> 00:42:28,608
confronted with a two hundred foot twelve monster.

476
00:42:29,187 --> 00:42:31,445
That's right. Yeah. Because the

477
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:35,440
the chill solidified meat is gonna turn out to be very effective

478
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:37,295
they use the tons to hop

479
00:42:37,795 --> 00:42:38,994
to drop it into the hatch,

480
00:42:39,714 --> 00:42:43,549
and they hear him eating it. And then we get just this

481
00:42:44,288 --> 00:42:51,880
spectacular. I I don't know. Maybe this is devices. But I I absolutely love this panel of the octopus rising and spicy agony.

482
00:42:52,413 --> 00:42:59,273
From the ship. Utterly ob it. It's a a full half page. There Barks sea Barks,

483
00:42:59,313 --> 00:43:00,849
fleeing the dev devastation.

484
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:04,300
There's a greatest fresh on the octopus face.

485
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,700
And the nephew he says, oh, I must used sprinkle too much pepper.

486
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:17,445
And when I read this, at age either seven or eight. I was I was pretty much hollow with left between this one and the next panel.

487
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:25,730
I I do think this is probably a moment of levi that bark, you know, stuck in because he wanted to diffuse this.

488
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:33,468
Pretty creepy story, but... But I just... I love it so much. Yeah. It's definitely a a memorable frame. I also

489
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:37,077
Yeah. It's definitely a a memorable frame. I also

490
00:43:37,776 --> 00:43:42,311
didn't notice until we're reading it now, but he's finally doing some like half page splash

491
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:46,673
instead of just eight of the page eight of the pay eight of the page. Here's some

492
00:43:47,408 --> 00:44:02,595
exposition He's taking some time to kind of save her some of the visuals Yeah. They're few and far between, but sometimes he does get to push the medium. K. So on the next page, we get our last glimpse of the octopus. Using his tentacles to to run away

493
00:44:03,655 --> 00:44:04,155
over

494
00:44:04,535 --> 00:44:10,187
uber the reef and one of the nephews gets off the great line. I wonder what Huey, give for a ton of ice cream.

495
00:44:10,987 --> 00:44:12,805
And this is left the entrance

496
00:44:13,624 --> 00:44:20,295
exposed. The g has a trap door on it. That they figure is locked from below.

497
00:44:20,915 --> 00:44:33,127
You know, they can open it with the tongs, but the nephews are out of idea but Donald got one now. He says he's got a plan, and that Al he needs is a squirt gun and a couple of mice. So they find a single mouse

498
00:44:33,464 --> 00:44:34,701
from in the galley.

499
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:40,679
The nephews are very surprised that that's all he wants to combat the Armored man. But

500
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:41,715
Donald

501
00:44:42,053 --> 00:44:47,590
takes a look at the grow mouse and says the likes the grinch in his eyes. And he takes

502
00:44:47,927 --> 00:44:49,025
the squirt gun

503
00:44:49,362 --> 00:44:52,213
filled with roach powder, and he heads off, and

504
00:44:52,805 --> 00:44:56,501
just a really cool line from that you, so I'm gonna read it in its entirety.

505
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:09,390
Going into battle, an armored man with a square gun and mouse. Do you suppose on mcdonald's in his right mind I hope not. His sensible ideas never work. So Donald arrives at the trap door and asks the nephews used to open it.

506
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:28,613
And he's getting ready to square the man with the roach powder, but he comes up with a with a gun instead of sort like donald expect Donald is able to duck the shot in the nick of time. He squirt the armored and man with the powder and he falls cla into the g. And Donald

507
00:45:29,748 --> 00:45:33,478
drops down with the mouse who he has nick nickname mont more.

508
00:45:33,855 --> 00:45:40,397
Which again, just a great little random touch the the the ferocious mouse that's sn in his cage.

509
00:45:40,935 --> 00:45:44,472
The other man, of course, is welding. It's like a blender bus. It's not even

510
00:45:45,144 --> 00:45:48,874
any kind of gun that we would have seen in the last two or three hundred years.

511
00:45:49,928 --> 00:45:51,903
The big the big kind of bell

512
00:45:52,241 --> 00:45:56,586
at the end like a like a trumpet. I guess it's a kind of musk, but

513
00:45:57,443 --> 00:45:58,741
I also thought it was interesting

514
00:45:59,479 --> 00:46:01,097
to see a small

515
00:46:01,555 --> 00:46:03,591
realistic looking mouse in a Disney comic.

516
00:46:04,324 --> 00:46:10,487
In in theoretically the same world that Mickey mouse lives in. And I I wondered about the the laws of this universe again.

517
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:20,033
And again, it's just for a Barks fan, it's just some thing that's total background. You will probably stop thinking about it another five to ten issues in.

518
00:46:20,649 --> 00:46:24,676
So while the man is distracted, you know, with the of

519
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:27,116
roach pattern his eyes, Donald

520
00:46:27,656 --> 00:46:29,036
drops Sm more and

521
00:46:29,616 --> 00:46:32,216
and says in you go, it's your job to get out.

522
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:37,096
And the armored man freaks out. He says that damon is loose in my armor.

523
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:42,161
He's removing his helmet. We see that he's kind of a feeble old man.

524
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:55,772
There's a panel where Donald yells at him take it off. Take it off, Take it off, and I've gotta say I'm kinda surprised the one hasn't been picked up as some kind of a meme as out of context. It's it's pretty funny.

525
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:59,361
So the armored man does remove all his armor.

526
00:46:59,895 --> 00:47:04,504
And he comes to his senses. As Donald is standing with his

527
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:13,871
musk his sword and behind his Canon and says now we face each other on even terms sir boiler shirt and does a final touch mount warranty

528
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:14,611
sn.

529
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:16,962
Very fear some tiny mouse.

530
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,072
I have to say, this this was immediately reminiscent to me of

531
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:26,834
my favorite musical number from another Disney property, fin and Fe. There is an early episode

532
00:47:27,332 --> 00:47:28,032
in which

533
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:51,505
For for abs older her sister is trying to be on a date, and her Nemesis has cro mccabe some acorns into her pants and two squirrels immediately dive into her pants and run around the inside of her pants to try and find the acorns. And then we have a yes, a fantastic two minute number called squirrel my pads done by two two free style wrappers who happen to be there in the park and think that she

534
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:55,760
Metaphorically has some squirrels in her pants, and that's why she's dancing so awesome.

535
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:02,347
And she actually moves a lot like this guy. Like, it's it's kind of the same I guess it's the universal way of indicating.

536
00:48:02,805 --> 00:48:05,021
I have small mammals inside of my trousers.

537
00:48:06,237 --> 00:48:12,866
That's true. I wonder this is how a person moved see. It is it is a another Disney property. Maybe.

538
00:48:13,886 --> 00:48:14,826
What their names,

539
00:48:15,485 --> 00:48:15,985
swamp,

540
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:17,026
and

541
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:28,005
trying to remember the finish creators. Dan Meyer? That's right. And Jeff Marsh. Right? Maybe Yeah. Maybe they were big Barks fans. Who knows. That is extremely plausible.

542
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:28,386
Yeah.

543
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:33,765
Alright. So on the next page, you know, everyone is reunited, they've rescued

544
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:41,840
dewey we and the Armored man is despair what's gonna become with him. What is his lord surf Francis Drake.

545
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:49,526
When will he think of him and he reveals that he was safeguard regarding a treasure, and he didn't keep the gold safe.

546
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:57,971
Donald sees the the gold and he starts to drool over it and they hear his story because of now now, of course, they can.

547
00:48:58,823 --> 00:49:05,422
They reveal, you know, the the do figure out that this guy thinks that her Francis drake is still alive

548
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:06,339
and

549
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:08,945
they kind of all sit around the lantern,

550
00:49:09,282 --> 00:49:14,901
and he explains how, you know, a ship was washed over this wreath.

551
00:49:15,474 --> 00:49:18,644
And had crashed into the cavern above

552
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:29,533
and that the captain of the ship ended up staying to guard the treasure or the the sole survivor rather stayed to guard the treasure.

553
00:49:30,173 --> 00:49:31,771
This is on to the next page.

554
00:49:32,186 --> 00:49:40,696
He brought the treasure down into the cavern and waited for her Francis drake to return, but as the years passed and he got older.

555
00:49:41,152 --> 00:49:41,652
He

556
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,285
decided to

557
00:49:44,258 --> 00:49:49,558
embark on the kidnapping that wound being passed down from generation

558
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,526
to generation of armored man every fifty years.

559
00:49:54,101 --> 00:50:00,901
Someone would kid another boy off the local island. And so the secret of the kit kidnapping is out.

560
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:04,426
There's another great download line on here.

561
00:50:05,263 --> 00:50:19,601
There's a couple of them... All everyone's starting to talk to like him now. On the pre... On the previous page, the nephews used the term odds bob Now. And on on this page, Donald asks if the armored man was the sole survivor of the crash four hundred years ago, and he says, no.

562
00:50:20,216 --> 00:50:21,276
The captain was...

563
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:22,396
And

564
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:33,345
Donald says, thanks. Now I can start believing you calendar again. Yeah. Yeah. That was I loud that this is not some kind of immortal being that is... Yeah. Living in inside to shift.

565
00:50:34,144 --> 00:50:38,733
That's a good catch because that is also one of my favorite quotes in this one. Alright. So

566
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,367
the secret is out

567
00:50:40,783 --> 00:50:51,140
This is become sort of a generational curse rather than a supernatural one. Donald takes a quick moment to act like, he is her francis drake,

568
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:57,986
but the guy like no not you. I've got a picture of him in this book. So Donald isn't able to get the gold.

569
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,646
We transition pretty quickly.

570
00:51:01,261 --> 00:51:01,761
To

571
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:07,581
the depths being fed as heroes on the island for stopping this sort of generational curse.

572
00:51:08,116 --> 00:51:09,936
Donald asks after the gold,

573
00:51:10,636 --> 00:51:23,471
but the guy who's presenting him to the key... The key to the city, the the mayor says sorry, by salvage rights. You know, the goal belongs to the man who was guarding it. And and the last panel. Ryan, Why don't you tell us about the last panel?

574
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:29,497
He's at Tony's burger palace which appears to be kind of a an outdoor diner or a food truck or something.

575
00:51:30,135 --> 00:51:31,872
And he's in some ridiculous

576
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,847
clothes. This is how I would think of, like,

577
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:35,478
a very os

578
00:51:35,856 --> 00:51:40,027
billionaire being dressed in maybe the twenties or the teens, I would say,

579
00:51:40,763 --> 00:51:42,675
And he's in some very

580
00:51:43,013 --> 00:52:07,831
ge clothing with a, like a pocket chain and a wide pink hat and very pointy shoulders on his on his jacket and then just a big open sack of gold coins right next to him on the stool. He says another of the hamburger sc nave, They taste mighty good mighty with an at the end good with any at the end after and half century of you fish, and we get the nice little cap. That it is yi end. And so

581
00:52:08,131 --> 00:52:08,991
that is...

582
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:11,271
That is the ghost of the g.

583
00:52:12,465 --> 00:52:17,214
I I know I've been refusing over this one because I love this story.

584
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:18,632
Almost everything

585
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,161
about it works for me, you know, there's

586
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:28,100
couple of, like parts that, like, it's not quite a perfect story, but to me, this is some of of Bark.

587
00:52:28,515 --> 00:52:35,836
At its best. I'll talk about that in a minute. But but, you know, I'm I'm curious just right off the bat. Like, what do you think of this one?

588
00:52:36,689 --> 00:52:38,883
I love it. This this might be my new favorite one.

589
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:46,740
I like... I like a little mystery. I like that our good guys are good guys. And they, you know, use their clever nest to kind of

590
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:51,847
overcome the the bad guy and then solve the mystery and resolve the conflict

591
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,260
I thought it was interesting.

592
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:54,578
This is the first...

593
00:52:55,037 --> 00:53:10,185
This is the first one I've read that involves a large pile of gold of the many that we've read so far that involve Al large pile of gold, where Donald did not end up with the gold, he is he has a key to the city and the thanks of the... All the people whose kids are not getting kicked that now. And

594
00:53:10,661 --> 00:53:25,416
He just has to be grumpy knowing that he's a hero instead of a rich hero. But, yeah, I liked the bad guy. I like that the bad guy wasn't even like evil, he just thought it was his duty, you know, to... Yeah. It's like a legacy. Yeah. I like that it was all in one spot.

595
00:53:25,756 --> 00:53:27,016
I like the kind of elements

596
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:30,542
and the artwork work, I like the giant octopus and just kind of

597
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:41,916
trying to beat each other with very limited resources. I mean, this guy just has whatever was on the boat four hundred years ago, And then Donald has whatever happened to be on his boat when they went out to go, get some help for the day,

598
00:53:42,516 --> 00:53:43,016
and

599
00:53:43,796 --> 00:53:45,436
that's the nature of their combat.

600
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:49,131
That's true. It's like a a really good matching of width.

601
00:53:49,611 --> 00:53:53,311
I'm I'm really glad to hear that you liked this one This one is

602
00:53:54,105 --> 00:54:10,371
just to me some of the best of Barks. You know? I I love the setup as you say, it's really tight even if this came out of, like, a different sort of comic ten page setup up. I feel like it's very organic how it starts out. I love the setup at the beginning.

603
00:54:10,825 --> 00:54:16,623
Where you kinda just hear these rumbling in the background, you know, it sets it up very suspense.

604
00:54:16,959 --> 00:54:17,459
And

605
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:18,409
those, like,

606
00:54:19,205 --> 00:54:21,140
conversations about the missing boys

607
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:26,535
make for a really great element of of craziness this. And,

608
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:34,877
you know, there there are some very silly parts, but this is a deeply dark story. Right? I mean, it's about kid kidnapping that obviously ruined

609
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:38,902
half dozen or so lives over the course of hundreds of years.

610
00:54:39,461 --> 00:54:43,291
And, you know, the sub text is that these kids were, like, brain washed.

611
00:54:43,745 --> 00:54:44,963
Into this, basically

612
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:50,681
over over the centuries and grew up with this, like, horrible legacy. So

613
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:55,055
I like that the armored man gets his sort of freedom at the end.

614
00:54:56,254 --> 00:55:08,780
I think the humor in this is really great. I I think my only real criticism I did feel like the ending was just a little bit too abrupt. In this one, you know, the little transition to the hamburger stand, it happens pretty quick.

615
00:55:09,198 --> 00:55:12,731
But otherwise, I I I would call this one a masterpiece.

616
00:55:13,388 --> 00:55:13,888
And,

617
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:15,245
fortunately,

618
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:22,803
the users of the index site would agree with me. You know, we always check Inducks

619
00:55:23,061 --> 00:55:25,117
to see what that user generated

620
00:55:26,028 --> 00:55:33,561
score average is this one is rated very high. This one gets an eight point zero out of ten as of right now.

621
00:55:34,296 --> 00:55:35,436
Good for forty

622
00:55:35,776 --> 00:55:39,396
first place out of over forty thousand eight hundred

623
00:55:39,816 --> 00:55:40,776
Disney comics.

624
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:47,484
This is our first top fifty story in fact, out of the five hundred some Barks stories. This is

625
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:53,411
top. This is the top thirty second of all the Barks and the top forty first

626
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:58,578
overall. So we're we're a high into the ninety nine point ninth percentile here.

627
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:04,203
This is a beloved bark adventure that really does set the tone for a lot of the stories

628
00:56:04,596 --> 00:56:05,695
that are gonna follow.

629
00:56:06,274 --> 00:56:07,213
Any any other

630
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:10,530
thoughts about just the sort of,

631
00:56:10,949 --> 00:56:17,433
you know, how the story is before I talk about some other reflections and how it holds up and the other media.

632
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,168
Yeah. It's just...

633
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:32,047
Like I can tell, it was very well thought out And it's not like trophy. You know what I mean? It's not like oh, this this old thing again they switched to bodies because they both touched mystical object at the same time or whatever, Like,

634
00:56:33,179 --> 00:56:34,398
This is a really interesting

635
00:56:35,295 --> 00:56:41,503
narrative, you know. And and I think it tells it really well. Yeah. I agree. It's it's it's sat on a good

636
00:56:42,056 --> 00:56:44,647
it just has such a good setup and a good flow.

637
00:56:45,764 --> 00:56:51,248
I would say that this one also holds up very well. You know? There's not really a lot that's

638
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,492
kind of retro grade or problematic about it.

639
00:56:54,989 --> 00:57:05,646
You know, I I I guess this is before kind of the stranger danger Era, where I think you know, people would probably look in a scans that a a kidnapping plot like this. But...

640
00:57:06,026 --> 00:57:19,985
But in general, this this holds up very well. The only thing that's kind of archaic is kind of our understanding of of middle English. Right? I don't know if you're aware of this but the use of yee, do you know why that's historically incorrect.

641
00:57:20,526 --> 00:57:20,606
Yes.

642
00:57:21,566 --> 00:57:22,505
It's because

643
00:57:23,126 --> 00:57:25,526
there was a the letter thorn. Right?

644
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:33,801
That is to make the the the sound at the beginning of the word the. And when it's written, it looks to our modern eye like a y

645
00:57:34,181 --> 00:57:54,346
And so you and I happening upon it would look at it and say, oh, that looks like a year And so we we thought that everyone was talking like that back then, but they would have just said the or the the way we do and and written down in a way that looks like a. Exactly. That's exactly right. Very well said it's And so, you know, we have a lot of, like, European and other international listeners

646
00:57:55,366 --> 00:58:05,011
and and I'm I'm curious how they represent in the translation sort of this archaic speech. But this is sort of signaling to us when we see y old.

647
00:58:05,465 --> 00:58:19,285
We know that it's supposed to be a little tiny. But really, it would be pronounced the old. And in my own kind of mental gymnastics for justifying this, I I would say that over the generations as the... There's been this sort of passing on this burden.

648
00:58:20,575 --> 00:58:29,678
That, you know, maybe one of the kids was taught out of a book or something. He could've have made that kind of mistake and started to pass on the the old use

649
00:58:30,734 --> 00:58:31,932
speed speaking.

650
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:42,595
So anyway, That's true. Yeah. Then this is not actually a a figure from the sixteen hundred he he played a game of telephone for four hundred years. That's right. Is at the end of it. Exactly.

651
00:58:43,655 --> 00:58:50,930
So appearances and other media. As I mentioned, this was a story that bark to do an oil painting for.

652
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:55,698
It's well worth looking up. It's it's beautiful. It shows the man

653
00:58:56,554 --> 00:59:01,058
walking out of the out of the sea behind the Ducktales

654
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:04,005
about to strike and it's it's a very

655
00:59:04,422 --> 00:59:06,097
well known painting of his...

656
00:59:06,775 --> 00:59:08,072
I think it was done in miniature.

657
00:59:08,968 --> 00:59:20,306
The one of the covers for this was That expectation of that. I'll have to share that one with you and I'll put it up on the Facebook page I'm not aware of any other use of the Armored man or any references and Ducktales or anything.

658
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:27,120
I did see... I I consider this one to be a very educational one in some ways, you know, just learning about

659
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,449
help being turned into Iodine was was

660
00:59:30,986 --> 00:59:37,547
educational for me. I saw some of the mechanics of how tide worked in this. A lot of those great nautical terms

661
00:59:38,418 --> 00:59:44,022
Some of the archaic terms that are used are actually accurate. I like the use of, like, how it

662
00:59:44,359 --> 00:59:46,951
as an ad adverb in the English.

663
00:59:48,361 --> 00:59:50,455
So, again, this is just a masterpiece.

664
00:59:51,509 --> 00:59:54,656
Do you want to nominate a favorite panel?

665
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,663
Or talk about any of them is your choice.

666
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,355
I think I think my favorite panel

667
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:03,843
might be when

668
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:06,475
Donald goes up to the hatch with his

669
01:00:07,012 --> 01:00:13,630
roach spray loaded up in his squirt gun, and the hatch pops open with the armored man and his blender bus He kind of

670
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:16,270
consumes the front half of Donald face with it.

671
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:30,476
Donald is is halfway halfway into the end of the Front us there, and says, u. I expected you to pop up with a sword. I just like the... Just kind of the... He is in Immortal danger, but he's still not losing losing his

672
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:34,483
his census, you know, he's still in kind of control of the situation.

673
01:00:34,941 --> 01:00:38,514
He was surprised He's a little off balance. He's gonna figure out how to recover from this.

674
01:00:39,451 --> 01:00:48,446
Yeah. I I really like your favorite panel choices. You have some of the, like, less conventional ones. You know? I'm very drawn towards the show panels.

675
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:55,640
And I I really do have to go with the ones that are obvious, you know, the one with the armored man

676
01:00:56,100 --> 01:01:11,206
illuminated after or he gets off the ship for the first time. It's it's very show. It screams to to be recognized, but I'm I'm a sucker. For that panel. And then, you know, as you heard me wax on about the

677
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:26,490
the octopus interrupting from the ship, that that is another great one. But and this would be... When the when the three of them try to look down the cabin at the same time, when do we shout up, and they Al fuck their heads together. That's pretty good. Yeah. That's a fun moment. Excellent.

678
01:01:27,547 --> 01:01:35,152
Well, thank you again so much for joining me for this. I'm glad I'm glad that you got a new favorite. This one

679
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:37,926
is now the highest rated

680
01:01:38,306 --> 01:01:40,126
that we have talked about.

681
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:50,714
I don't think it's gonna be for very long because we're about to enter kind of a a a very classic very rich period of Barks work. But

682
01:01:51,225 --> 01:01:53,180
Yeah. There's a lot to look forward to here.

683
01:01:54,217 --> 01:01:58,201
Coming up next episode, we are gonna be talking about

684
01:01:58,979 --> 01:02:00,477
adventure down under.

685
01:02:00,815 --> 01:02:01,315
And

686
01:02:02,212 --> 01:02:07,222
again, to to listeners, I'm I'm just really grateful. I've gotten some nice notes recently

687
01:02:08,055 --> 01:02:12,865
about the show, and we are picking up some steam and getting a lot of international

688
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:20,311
listeners, and I'm just I'm so grateful for Severino one who gives this a listen. So again, thanks for joining us.
