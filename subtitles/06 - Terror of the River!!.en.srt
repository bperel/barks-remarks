00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:55,351
Welcome everyone. I am Mark Sever, a Grown man who enjoys Donald Inducks

5
00:00:55,511 --> 00:01:13,174
and uncle Scrooge Comments. And this week, I'm joined by two other grown men who I managed to convince to let me talk about these comments And Ryan, if you could introduce yourself. I'm Ryan Bailey. This is what I sound like. And Eric, I'm

6
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:14,212
currently,

7
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:22,626
and I do not. Sound like we're on bailey. Alright. Hey, guys, have come either of you ever been on a house about. I have. Yes.

8
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:28,751
In fact, I remember when I was in middle school, my dad had, like, a company

9
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:51,330
party that we got invited to. We were all hanging out on the house vote with all his coworkers and their families and stuff. And I remember one morning, my dad and I trying to fish the top of the boat and we were just fishing and fishing and nothing even n our bait, but we could actually see the fish, like, jumping up out of the water That's my house phone memory. So no no giant serpents though,

10
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:56,696
not that I will recall now. Do was it... Was it is awesome as the

11
00:01:57,113 --> 00:02:03,215
as Donald and the nephews, like, first couple of days on the river before i get attached.

12
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:05,695
It has... It does have kind of a placid

13
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:06,775
natural

14
00:02:07,155 --> 00:02:19,655
quality, you know, Well, and, of course, I asked about the house, but because we are going to be talking about the error of the river, two exclamation points this time. My exclamation point for each of your c

15
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:30,280
Yeah. Yeah. That's alright. And You said you have you have not had the pleasure of being on the house, but I have not. Close the i've denim of waters why Interrupting.

16
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,120
Oh, that's pretty good. I haven't done either. So I definitely

17
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,489
thought it looked like a blast after reading this comment because over and over as a kid. So...

18
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:45,015
Yeah. But I can live by seriously through donald and the nephews.

19
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:46,910
This comic...

20
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:57,497
A little bit of background, this one was published. The cover date was January of nineteen forty six. And tara of the river was printed in four color

21
00:02:58,035 --> 00:03:06,269
number one hundred and eight is the twenty eight page a little bit longer than many of them. And our our synopsis for this episode,

22
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:07,726
Donald

23
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:09,720
sneezes at an auction

24
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,725
are mistaken for bids on a house boat

25
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:20,165
And soon he and the nephews, find themselves sailing down the Ohio and eventually the Mississippi River,

26
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:27,586
and there they encounter a huge c serpent which they later learn is actually an elaborate submarine

27
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:38,195
whose captain gets his pleasure from scaring with the Jesus out of people. So I'm I'm very excited to talk about this one. This is very high concept.

28
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:41,546
And, you know, I read this one

29
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:43,025
over and over

30
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:47,513
as a kid. Let's see. A little bit of

31
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,512
background trivia. There there's a really good quote that I found from Carl Barks

32
00:03:53,229 --> 00:04:00,892
about how he really wanted to have a villain that was quote, a mean son of a gun. And so he

33
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,210
tried to

34
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:10,086
He tried to do that. You tried to avoid having to censor it by making him totally nutty so that it would get by the editors.

35
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,460
Rather than making him murderous.

36
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:31,112
I created a guy that didn't leave any bad taste and people's mouths didn't cause children any nightmares. But, you know, still had that fear element. So we'll we'll talk about how that worked out, but I I think that the character, the scare as he's referred is really

37
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:40,426
really fast maybe one to me. I wanna talk to about the value range for this comic. This one had one

38
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:41,384
recently

39
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:48,462
sold or a few years ago. There was a document sale of a nine point five great copy, which is like pretty close.

40
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,293
Yeah. That's pretty close to mint.

41
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,260
And that one was sold for ninety five hundred dollars.

42
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:57,592
So pretty pretty good value.

43
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:10,139
I also found it notable. I I think you guys probably saw the cover that was drawn by don Yet, I think is that you say name, that shows the c disturbing on the front, but the original

44
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:10,979
publication

45
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:22,294
doesn't show the surf it shows the nephews kind of reacting in tear Al. And that cover is actually based on one of Barks

46
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:25,305
oil paintings, one of those more famous ones.

47
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:30,854
It usually goes the other direction. Right? Where he makes oil painting space son stomachs?

48
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:35,694
Yeah. Exactly. So this one, this one was a little bit different. He

49
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:38,334
he created it for one of the scenes.

50
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:45,076
But... Yeah. Really I'll have to share the image with you guys, and I can put it up on Facebook for listeners to check out.

51
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:49,504
Yeah. We can we can show the other versions of covered too. So

52
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:54,744
in in talking about the background on this one, there's a lot to talk about

53
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:56,504
for a historical

54
00:05:56,964 --> 00:05:57,244
context.

55
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:04,099
I kinda dove into a couple of things. Right? Because this one is really about River life.

56
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:09,165
And and I think a lot of the American attachment to the Mississippi

57
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,022
River,

58
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,365
the Ohio and the Mississippi, And then also just the kind of

59
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:16,722
war

60
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,680
paranoia

61
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,610
that I think enable this one. Like, when I read these stories,

62
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:25,314
When I was reading as a kid, I really read them as text.

63
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:27,666
Right? As, like, funny. It exciting

64
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,395
stories. But as I go back to them later,

65
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:37,685
I I still try and enjoy them in the same way, but, you know, you can't help but read them as sub now. And

66
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:42,645
when I think about the timeline of this story in nineteen forty six,

67
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:50,265
you know, on what's going on in the world, it's it's really apparent that Bart wrote this with the backdrop of, like, submarine, Paranoia.

68
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:56,992
Right? We we had several years in the North Atlantic with the German u boats,

69
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:58,110
just like

70
00:06:58,449 --> 00:06:58,949
d

71
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:06,040
the the shipping fleet and and I think that that notion that something from below

72
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:13,572
could just appear is whether he was thinking about it or not. I think that's a big part of what this story is

73
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:18,185
about just, like, the terra that that could lie and underneath the wave.

74
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:21,412
I don't know. Maybe I'm over thinking this one, but

75
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:24,341
but that's what I read now. That's interesting.

76
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,759
That's an interesting

77
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:28,271
contrast to, like, a lot of this genre

78
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:29,085
media

79
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:31,525
from this period is about

80
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:32,965
nuclear stuff

81
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:35,665
instead of something unknown coming from below.

82
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:39,616
Yeah. And and I think we're we're very close

83
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:43,891
to making that transition. In fact, literally our next

84
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:51,131
our next story after this one is is called Donald Duck Adam Bomb. So that little

85
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:53,025
a literal transition there.

86
00:07:54,038 --> 00:08:06,615
I went a little bit down the rabbit hole of just kinda looking up some of the information. So the the submarines, of course, had been around for a long time, but it wasn't until World war two that they could actually, like, pursue

87
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,635
follow and and chase down ships.

88
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:13,064
And I read that about seventy

89
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:16,315
percent of all the ships that were lost in the Atlantic.

90
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:18,870
Around this time, we're sunk by you ups.

91
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:20,782
More than two thousand

92
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,686
seven hundred of them. And there's a quote that kept coming up that said compared with the world war one

93
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:30,096
submarines in World war two

94
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:32,850
exhibited greater speed more effective weaponry,

95
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:34,047
sophisticated

96
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:35,005
detection

97
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:45,585
technology and great versatility. And could pursue their victims rather than just lying and weight. So, again, I think that was kind of what was hanging over over this.

98
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:46,899
And

99
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:50,695
there were, in fact, a lot of rumors

100
00:08:51,074 --> 00:08:52,093
around the time

101
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:53,212
about

102
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:54,590
submarines that were like,

103
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:55,905
venturing

104
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:58,585
inland into the great Lakes.

105
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:03,445
There was even a rumor about one that had a mission to destroy the hoover dam.

106
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,040
Which, you know, it was nonsense, of course. But you can imagine

107
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,520
world war two, that kind of that kind of talk going around. And then

108
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:17,206
I don't know about you guys, but I I feel like during our childhood,

109
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:21,596
just the the notion of, like, the Mississippi River and

110
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:29,881
you know, the story is a Barks twain. I feel like it was more salient still. I feel like that's not as salient these days.

111
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:37,738
But I think that it it just was much stronger in kind of the American Psyche. Did you guys read

112
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:41,023
much of that? Back then. No. I don't think so.

113
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:50,444
Alright Think. But I can tell I can tell that Donald has that. I mean, Eric, Go ahead. I was gonna say the the Mississippi has always had this

114
00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:51,442
mystical

115
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:56,024
pull on the country as river that goes right down in the middle of it.

116
00:09:57,102 --> 00:09:58,400
And has such a

117
00:09:58,938 --> 00:09:59,438
strong

118
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:02,631
place in the... Just American honda

119
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:11,115
I mean, the boats, the gambling, all those things. I don't even know how many johnny cash songs there are about the river.

120
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:13,285
Yeah. I agree

121
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:14,500
Ryan, did you have a thought?

122
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:16,355
I can tell that

123
00:10:16,972 --> 00:10:19,386
Donald or probably more accurately, Carl

124
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:20,874
has that

125
00:10:21,574 --> 00:10:22,194
sort of

126
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:23,154
romance

127
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:25,954
about it, you know, this this vision of

128
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:30,526
kind of this narrative, I guess, so of the beauty and

129
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:40,881
American ness of it and and imagine, you know, this paradise. Yeah. I think I think there's little little more American then the mississippi around the ideas

130
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,979
around it.

131
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:44,637
And and so before we...

132
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:52,561
Before we go into the story itself. The only notable appearance the only character appearance is the aforementioned character

133
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,133
the scare.

134
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:58,016
That's how he's, like, universally referred to by fans.

135
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:02,558
I don't think that they ever calling him that in the story and I might be mis

136
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:03,677
And

137
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,473
I'm I'm very excited to talk about him. I think he's a

138
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,191
really weird

139
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,384
and unique villain. And I dig it. I'm all for them.

140
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:21,926
I'm thinking he's a bill without being a bad guy. Is he's he's a foil. He seems... He comes up more is just a prank

141
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:23,003
an actual

142
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:26,210
evil villain. I mean, initially,

143
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:32,502
Right? And until he kinda takes the turn and you realize that he's he's all in because he'll

144
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:33,596
murder.

145
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:38,944
To to follow through. But, yeah, I mean, at first he does kinda...

146
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:41,441
Anyway, we'll we'll obviously get into him.

147
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:48,555
Let's see. You guys... You guys ready to go into the story? Yeah. Let's have excellent.

148
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:51,375
Alright. So the care of the river,

149
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,763
it opens up with a splash panel

150
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,835
actually have donald on the house boat,

151
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:09,137
being terrorized by the serpent, which, you know, is not very common in Barks. So it's kind of like... He's he's laying it out. There's a little bit of a mystery at the beginning, but we get kind of

152
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:11,388
surprising preview here.

153
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,625
And then it opens the donald

154
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:17,300
deciding to sit inside an auction house

155
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:18,911
to get out of the cold

156
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:21,681
while he seems to be suffering from a cold.

157
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:26,728
So we've got one of those classic bits where a character is gonna accidentally

158
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:27,939
buy something

159
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:31,130
because of a sneezing or a coughing fit at an auction.

160
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:47,343
It's kind of a cli by now, but maybe it wasn't back then. And so the the auction year shows a picture of one of the auction lots, which is a house boat, and he talks it up as being waived ten thousand at least. Huey, starts bidding at eighteen dollars.

161
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:48,522
And

162
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:51,315
by the end of the first page Donald

163
00:12:51,732 --> 00:12:58,291
sneezing fit has caused him to drive the bid up to twenty five dollars with him being the only bidder.

164
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:10,451
So I was curious about this I... My first thought was, wow, this is a very tired trope, and then I thought was this tire truck back then, or is this the first one? So I looked it up. I'm night.

165
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:18,727
What I thought of as the accidentally building bidding Al a public auction trump. The earliest example I could find is

166
00:13:19,226 --> 00:13:19,726
a

167
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:28,323
story told verse in an English book called the tour of doctor Tax in which he he accidentally buys something at a

168
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,559
Al auction.

169
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:31,314
And then I found

170
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:33,765
Abbott Case costello joined the foreign legion,

171
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:41,111
movie you from nineteen fifty, which is notably after this, another movie called Mister Drake Duck where he

172
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:44,597
accidentally buys the Inducks that lays uranium eggs

173
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:46,511
because everything has to be tom.

174
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:52,549
They've i've seen that. I just I just totally flash back into the past. I forgotten

175
00:13:52,888 --> 00:14:00,192
about that, but I've absolutely seen that movie. Of course, you have. And then I I feel like it was in all the like eighties and nineties,

176
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:10,985
Tv shows and movies and stuff. Yeah. It's a it's a staple. It's the only thing anybody knows about in person auctions is that unless you are a emotion silent statue,

177
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:14,501
you are bidding on this item regardless of anything.

178
00:14:15,294 --> 00:14:16,793
If is linked too aggressively.

179
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:22,586
This is now your item. It's definitely the only experience I have with on

180
00:14:23,498 --> 00:14:25,553
So, yeah, tired trope, but

181
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,082
but it it's it's evergreen. It's a classic.

182
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,423
Alright. So on page two, Donald keeps sneezing the bit up,

183
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:38,376
and he finally manages to mu himself at thirty dollars.

184
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:42,849
I looked this up. I'm I'm bet Ryan. You might have too.

185
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,369
But that's four hundred and twenty nine dollars and today's money. By my my mile wow.

186
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:51,421
And and it's still a very cheap boat.

187
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,437
It is. Although it won't end up being obviously.

188
00:14:55,815 --> 00:15:03,814
And then ask to the sale, the the auctions muscle man gives Donald the photo of the house about and bill of sale and demands he pay up

189
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:10,682
donald protests, and and we get a a great cut to him walking home, clutch the photo and bill

190
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:14,929
and clearly having been subjected to some brutal violence

191
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:20,889
by a muscle guy. I I was gonna ask you about that. Because on the next page, he has...

192
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:24,264
It looks kind of feather or whatever, like, they're trying to draw

193
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:26,944
long eyelashes or something around his eyes.

194
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:39,553
And I was gonna ask you is that is that supposed to be black eyes? It probably is as an Yeah. That's that's the the common depiction of black eyes for these characters. Definitely. We obviously got slow a couple of times. Yep.

195
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:50,419
Alright. So on page three, when he gets home, hue doing Louie c all rough up and they're concerned and they inquire what's happened. And he pi

196
00:15:50,759 --> 00:16:00,522
explains that he bought a house about and they they come to find out that it's Al in city called or a place called Hogan Pure in Flood out, Ohio.

197
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:15,345
He doing Louie note very precisely that that's fourth two thousand four hundred miles away. And so Don kinda gives it up as as too much and toss is the painting choosing to forget about it. But

198
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,065
as time passes,

199
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:18,560
they

200
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,520
find themselves thinking about it, and

201
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,040
all the duct start to fantasize

202
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,891
about river life. And Donald

203
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:35,720
throws the nephews by deciding to give the house loading thing to try. Well, who has it status able live improve her life. I mean, come on.

204
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:44,295
Slowing down the river and join with enjoying life. No cares in the I've gotta say over the past year, it seems like a pretty

205
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:46,255
pleasant way to social distance.

206
00:16:46,795 --> 00:16:48,229
That's true. Yeah

207
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:56,000
Alright. So on page four, we transitioned to their arrival by car at flood out, Ohio.

208
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:58,470
Which lives up to its name.

209
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:10,032
It's residents are all hun down on the roofs of their buildings. They're waiting for for a flood waters to subside. I imagine they must have, you know, weekly or monthly floods.

210
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,882
And they get some directions from a local to Hogan

211
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:14,694
here.

212
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:27,908
And I I really... I'm sure this is an old gag, but I love... I love his directions are very entertaining. He says that it's two blocks that way and twenty six feet that way pointing straight down beneath the water.

213
00:17:28,626 --> 00:17:33,615
And then they they arrived to find Hogan himself sitting on his pure sign,

214
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:39,335
and he tells them the boat is still tied to the pier completely submerged,

215
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:43,990
and they also are that it's five years of war owed

216
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:45,550
at

217
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:54,185
cost of a hundred and two dollars and ten cents. Or one thousand four hundred and sixty one bucks in twenty twenty one.

218
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,119
Yeah. Any thoughts on this page gentlemen. I respect the use of the word.

219
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:01,554
Yeah.

220
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:04,088
Yeah. I love a good emo.

221
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:06,495
I think in reading the the Barks

222
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:11,403
stories, especially the Scrooge ones. I got a lot of great synonyms

223
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,680
for

224
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,542
for money. Right? Because emo and Barks.

225
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,526
Do you guys know how much a saw Barks is? Is it twenty dollars? I believe it's a fiber.

226
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:23,320
Okay. I can be wrong though.

227
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:30,913
I I I I do want to point out everybody in this town is still in the town. They're just living on the roofs of their own houses.

228
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:33,327
Mh There's one one

229
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:34,977
apparently married couple,

230
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:40,405
just cooking breakfast and they have the dinner table perched on the on the peak of their of their roof,

231
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:42,295
like the wood burning stove

232
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:44,655
cooking pancakes or something.

233
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:52,590
Just having breakfast, that's just the life. They don't seem upset. I just... I I love the idea that Barks has fun naming

234
00:18:53,288 --> 00:19:06,315
his town's. So it's a very literal... It's flat out of Ohio That's... It gets gonna flood. That's why it's called that and no one bothers to move or anything. It's just that's how it is on the river. I love these high concepts towns that he creates.

235
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:09,075
We did the episode

236
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,370
on frozen gold

237
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,290
where the... I don't remember that. Oh, it was Barks, I think where i had a similar

238
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,305
seat where the snow

239
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:20,742
the snow level rose

240
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,235
and fell with the different blizzard. So this is kind of kind of another version of that.

241
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:27,148
Alright. So

242
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:28,906
on page five,

243
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:46,738
Donald again, he wants to give up on the idea of how because it's getting more and more expensive and difficult. But the kids suggest that they should at least look at it when when the flood received. And when it's revealed, they just can't resist over of a good house boat.

244
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:51,493
So they calculate that they're gonna need a few more dollars for the repairs

245
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:55,904
and the text box informs us that multi applies into many

246
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:00,059
until finally, they can sail away with

247
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:08,945
Hogan and warm sending them off. You know, he's he's turned into a nice puddle guy. Donald at first is very confident

248
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:11,023
about handling the house boat

249
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:14,034
but dewey remind him that Hogan

250
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:17,466
told them, they'd have a lot of lessons to learn.

251
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:30,254
And lesson number one comes up very quickly as they pass down wind a cold burning ship. I thought I thought at some point in the town, they would... They would be Al line to says,

252
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:52,497
why the entire town is underwater and why nobody minds or why the water is gone now? It's just what happens. It's not even worth talking about. That's what happens in Flat out, Ohio, sometimes you're breakfast on your roof? That's right. It's day to day. And I I mean, this is a good bit right, talking about how this is parity to the extreme, but the the banks of the these rivers,

253
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,985
they big flood constantly. This is what really happens.

254
00:20:56,877 --> 00:20:57,815
Alright. So

255
00:20:58,352 --> 00:20:59,888
on page six,

256
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:04,712
the... We see the kids grip while they're cleaning the the craft after

257
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:07,184
the encounter with the c burner.

258
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:13,539
And they passed near a large river boat that's gonna teach them less number two,

259
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:22,315
which is to have a clear channel when riding rough water. And so the... They they end up perched on top of a piling,

260
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:27,454
and they're stuck until the house both slips off and dunking them in the water.

261
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:31,769
Oh it continues the picked of donald making

262
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:35,950
boys work, and gals is like you know what? I've Gottfredson.

263
00:21:35,990 --> 00:22:01,013
I'm gonna sit on the I'm gonna take the sell myself on the deck. Enjoy the river. You three Al legs. Get cleaned. Yeah. Donald knows what's up. That's that's where you have kids for him. Alright? A good captain knows how to delegate. So page seven, he claims that he's learned every lesson he directs a course near the shore where the big boat can't bother them. But Donald gets promptly struck in his chest by an

264
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,927
extremely long branch

265
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,019
of a tree growing on the River Barks,

266
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,120
which is where they learn lesson than three when Severino close to shore, post the look lookout on the bow.

267
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:19,612
So then they they dropped the anchor for their dinner, and they discussed that they haven't had time to to fish

268
00:22:19,949 --> 00:22:23,338
so while they're talking about that, the current

269
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:25,316
terms their boat around.

270
00:22:25,835 --> 00:22:31,945
And I... I'm really enjoying these kind of like, this format that he's got. Right? Of

271
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:33,385
learning a lesson

272
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:41,835
as they go down the forever. It seems like an interesting way to kind of show us the learning curve of captain a house about.

273
00:22:42,252 --> 00:22:50,904
And I like that Carl had to think of these. Like, I wonder if they're are real things. Or if it's just things that he thought of that seemed impossible.

274
00:22:51,562 --> 00:22:53,901
Right. And it just seem logical to.

275
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,945
Yeah. I'm I'm trying to think of how the this... How they'll however we can change current to go upstream

276
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,993
that far north. I don't think they're like,

277
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:10,335
turning the other way. I think the boat is just giving a bit of a spin. Right?

278
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:24,450
That's what I thought. Yeah. I think they're... I think they're still, you know, in the same spot, and the current is still going the same way, but depending on how, like the the contours of the bank, you might you might get a little bit of an eddie that kind of turns you the other way a little bit. Yeah. That was my.

279
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:26,525
Alright. So

280
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:30,725
on page eight, while they are eating their dinner of beans,

281
00:23:31,585 --> 00:23:35,580
although in my print of it, it looks more like piece the way they've covered it.

282
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,540
They they discussed their destination. They wanna sail down to New Orleans.

283
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,000
Thousands of miles down the river.

284
00:23:43,773 --> 00:23:45,750
The kids asked Donald if

285
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:55,310
he is sure that he can find his way, and he sc that he just needs to keep going the way he is going. And that sets us up

286
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,310
to

287
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,390
Huey, doing Louie

288
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:06,104
looking at the oddly familiar River banks as they as they continue to sail down

289
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,697
what is actually up.

290
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:24,760
I'm impressed with Donald ability to fire beans into his mouth with a knife without looking. He's looking the nephews, but he's still shooting a bean up at a nice little Barks into his mouth. I assume that's how everyone ate in the forties. Yeah. For some reason, I see this depicted Inducks,

291
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,460
animation all the time with, like, pee

292
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,260
especially.

293
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:43,150
Yeah. Me keys with a knife. And I remember trying to replicate it as a kid. Couldn't do it. One of those lost skills like fencing or something like that. It's just something everybody knew the old old times. Yeah. The noble art of p railing Alright.

294
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:51,350
On page nine, the Nephews approach donald, and they break the news that, yeah, They're they're back and flood out of Ohio.

295
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:55,999
And he realizes pretty quickly what's happened. The chrome must have turned them around.

296
00:24:56,718 --> 00:25:03,346
And he learns the importance of lesson number four. Always take your bearing before Al hosting anchor.

297
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:04,585
So

298
00:25:04,964 --> 00:25:08,420
they get back underway and kids discussed their lack of progress

299
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:16,969
but they acknowledge that Donald is... He's a hands on learner. Right? He's not gonna make any more mistakes. Nowadays he's already made them And

300
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:29,050
now now Donald is much more cautious, much more careful. So he decides to more in Inducks Cove for the night before it gets dark. Yeah. I I like his learning style. Yeah. I like that the nephews

301
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:30,528
never,

302
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:47,791
like, get down on him. Al he makes blender after blender. They just say he's learned his stuff. They just they still look up to him. That's true. They've recognized his learning style. Is it weird that the the more adults in this really I mean, I that's established that they're richard is at this point.

303
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,282
But it it still need to see

304
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:58,550
them put up with him when they like, we can figure this out. Yeah. Definitely. I mean, a lot a lot of these

305
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:03,432
comics are really great wish full moment, right, For the kids that are reading them.

306
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:08,525
And I remember really identifying with the nephews, loving their junior wood chuck guide book,

307
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:11,511
And just just seeing how we're resourceful

308
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:15,155
and independent they are in in this one,

309
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:16,630
especially as really cool.

310
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,341
Alright. So

311
00:26:19,117 --> 00:26:20,871
on page ten,

312
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:25,895
and this where the story gets really good. Right? This is what we've been promised.

313
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:34,102
This is the tear of the river. That night, the doctor sleep on the river and an ominous shape breaks the surface

314
00:26:34,813 --> 00:26:38,025
His is at the house boat, it is a

315
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:39,341
enormous

316
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:40,816
c serpent.

317
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:43,409
It wakes one of the nephews.

318
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:54,884
And he looks out the window, and he just possibly acknowledges oh, it's it's only a giant sea serpent. And he goes back to bed before using on what realistic dream. Use having.

319
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:57,355
I've gotta say that I

320
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:04,345
love the, like, feature design on this c serpent. I think it's kind of like a mix of

321
00:27:04,842 --> 00:27:06,139
almost Chinese dragon

322
00:27:06,517 --> 00:27:08,333
and classic c serpent.

323
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:21,636
And I I remember trying to draw as a kid. I think I think he just got a really cool character design here Al looks. It looks really scary. Yeah. Yeah. The are kinda of feather and it has this kind of

324
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:28,602
Harry sort of ridge down the center of the back. And along For tongue and some really long

325
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:34,074
eva looking teeth. It looks like it's the little bit a beard too. Mh. Oh, yeah.

326
00:27:35,194 --> 00:27:38,709
Fits the classic c but it's not quite the

327
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:40,026
luck ness

328
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:40,944
mustard

329
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:42,222
type of

330
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,039
Al

331
00:27:44,077 --> 00:27:47,624
or or one of those ancient dinosaur sort things. And it's a nice

332
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:56,815
variation of what people think is caesar are but should look like without having a big dinosaur. Yeah. I think it kinda matches the, like, Huey, monsters

333
00:27:57,449 --> 00:28:01,349
legends from the old timing maps. But anyway, I I...

334
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:04,749
Such a cool feature design. Alright. So

335
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:06,681
on page eleven,

336
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,254
we're we're at Breakfast the next morning,

337
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,151
where Louis is

338
00:28:12,048 --> 00:28:14,159
discussing his very real sixteen

339
00:28:14,498 --> 00:28:14,998
dream

340
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:16,676
with the other Inducks

341
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:22,283
until they go outside and he sees the part of the boat where the serpent bent the stan

342
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,067
and dripped mud onto it. And so he and the other nephews

343
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:30,235
are ready to accept that it's real.

344
00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:35,409
But Donald sc that sea serpents and start segments in the imagination.

345
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,409
And just on queue, the serpent arises behind him,

346
00:28:39,944 --> 00:28:41,483
with its mouth gabe

347
00:28:41,942 --> 00:28:44,139
barring those terrifying things.

348
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:56,074
I like the a abrupt change and the narrative where we have the four lessons the four problems that are caused by not knowing enough about how to sail a river boat and the fifth problem that's just a giant C Monster.

349
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:57,484
It's

350
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:02,999
unrelated to any knowledge that Donald Has or does not have Yeah. Some the four lessons

351
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:09,088
don't really apply here at all. And now it's... Oh, so you wants Let's move on. So

352
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:10,646
the twelfth page

353
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:11,684
Donald

354
00:29:12,463 --> 00:29:15,912
yelp in fright and the Ducktales

355
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:24,329
trying to beat a hasty retreat, but they forget to un the more line. Donald cuts it loose, and he tells them to get ready to

356
00:29:24,867 --> 00:29:26,963
to help their get away by growing

357
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,280
and

358
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:32,112
the serpent lunges and they barely

359
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:32,690
escape.

360
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:34,804
And so then we

361
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:37,444
transition they head to the next landing,

362
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:40,124
and they call the local sheriff,

363
00:29:40,584 --> 00:29:41,859
but he is

364
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:43,698
immediately skeptical.

365
00:29:44,077 --> 00:29:48,173
He pretty much brushes them off. And and, you know, I'm trying to imagine if I was

366
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:49,191
a lazy,

367
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:53,778
River Sheriff how I would react if a bunch of

368
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:54,696
outsiders

369
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:56,671
started yelling about a c surface.

370
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:59,127
I like the Huey, frames it as

371
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:04,939
Suppose he spent the tax money looking for him and didn't see him. I mean, it's it's pretty tight.

372
00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:08,981
Yeah. He needs to spend a tax spare money. Warming that chair.

373
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:17,438
Yeah. I I like how Barks draws him and you get an immediate idea of of that guy's whole character,

374
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:27,400
which is don't bother me. On on the thirteenth page, they so they give up on getting help. They realized that you know, they're not gonna be believed.

375
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:44,281
And so they decide they've gotta put as much distance as possible between them and the and after a day sale, you know, the disturbance in the rear view, Donald feeling a little bit better about having the surf out of his mine, so he kinda he kinda relax a little bit.

376
00:30:44,698 --> 00:30:57,192
He... Like he mentioned he he lets the nephews do all the work here. He goes off to enjoy an nap, but his app gets interrupted by the serpent rising beneath them and lifting their whole house.

377
00:30:57,569 --> 00:30:59,105
Oh, donald the hero.

378
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:00,181
Thanks.

379
00:31:00,518 --> 00:31:02,652
I love... I also love just

380
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:08,412
writing it off entirely. Being like, well, we've gone slightly farther down the river where this monster lives.

381
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,206
Clearly, there's nothing left to worry about. Everything

382
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,860
has been resolved Yep. That's right.

383
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:17,287
Alright. So on page fourteen,

384
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:21,535
we see the boat sliding down the sharpen back into the water.

385
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:23,329
And

386
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:25,729
donald Bravely fleas.

387
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:27,689
One of the nephews

388
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:28,929
launches

389
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:30,169
a boat

390
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:31,464
at the surface,

391
00:31:32,122 --> 00:31:35,020
getting a really good direct hit in its throat.

392
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:36,258
And so

393
00:31:36,597 --> 00:31:37,817
we see the serpent

394
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:47,700
rising around I really like the art in that panel because it like shows just a great sense of movement. I think, of the boat and the serpent.

395
00:31:48,154 --> 00:31:51,734
The the serpent flips the craft out of the way,

396
00:31:52,114 --> 00:31:53,254
it emerges

397
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:56,194
then, you know, as they're kinda recovering,

398
00:31:56,609 --> 00:32:03,520
well then that nephew is puzzling over the fact that the serpent didn't bleed where he was hit. Very level headed.

399
00:32:04,014 --> 00:32:09,194
For observation skills for fighting off a c serpent is I hit it instinctively

400
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:31,959
Oh, hey I did believe. I love how these kids just seem like they're moving the narrative along. You got you always got check for blood. Yeah. I mean in your wood checks are not to be traveled with That's right. Oh man, and we don't even know that they're junior Inducks, I think at this point. Oh, that's true. So, you know, I don't know. We haven't been doing the ten pager. So I'll to look that up. On page the fifteen,

401
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:35,159
the nephews are they're considering the possibility

402
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,599
that the serpent

403
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:38,019
is a fake.

404
00:32:38,553 --> 00:32:41,963
And, you know, Donald rules that out, he's convinced,

405
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:43,039
but

406
00:32:43,656 --> 00:32:45,551
then the nephew pulls

407
00:32:45,888 --> 00:32:46,826
out the boat

408
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:52,154
When he recovers it, and indeed it's got a a fake rubber scale.

409
00:32:52,693 --> 00:33:07,791
Donald immediately changes his tim saying that he knew was fake all along. And now that they know that it's not real, you know, they're feeling better about things they're less intimidated, and they they agree that they're gonna track the serpents or the fake service

410
00:33:08,248 --> 00:33:14,968
back to its layer. Now now we've realized Al readers too that the sharpen is not real.

411
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:22,789
Reread this now, I'm like, okay. So we've taken obviously a lot of license with how this serpent act now it moves

412
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:23,828
because

413
00:33:24,606 --> 00:33:39,299
we couldn't get a fake to to move this convincing. But I think it makes for good story. Yeah. I noticed the line why would anyone build such a monster? That's an interesting for foreshadowing to. There's no sensible reason for anyone to have of these.

414
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:43,329
That's right. Alright. So on page sixteen,

415
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:44,566
we

416
00:33:45,144 --> 00:33:49,552
we see that they've been searching all day And so they anchor at another piling,

417
00:33:50,231 --> 00:33:52,169
and they need to take watch

418
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:55,885
while most of them sleep. Huey, takes the first watch

419
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:02,934
and he is very puzzled by a humming noise that he hears coming from the water at the end of the boat that's more to the piling.

420
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,484
And he says that it sounds like an electric motor, but then he kinda talks himself into

421
00:34:09,144 --> 00:34:12,058
assuming that it's like an underwater telephone on cable.

422
00:34:12,395 --> 00:34:15,925
In the light of the morning, they wake up and donald

423
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:19,314
realizes that they have somehow changed rivers

424
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:25,878
overnight and that they are now on Mighty muddy, Mississippi. Yeah. We get some good

425
00:34:26,216 --> 00:34:43,634
scale shots too. To show how big the river is from the from the viewpoint to the spa or something up here with a big steamboat in the background and a city even farther in the Barks ground. And those are... Actually, if you look up the previous page on that's a pretty detailed picture of some birds. That's...

426
00:34:43,974 --> 00:34:46,329
Yeah. It's true depiction. And

427
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:51,434
and a side note, I always thought dewey we had the blue hat. If duck

428
00:34:51,851 --> 00:35:02,418
told me to do we have the blue hat and this is Hue in the blue hat. So so I'm wondering if even the author gets confused sometimes. But the arthur didn't get confused Donald got confused.

429
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:06,669
This is one of those things that fans talk about how

430
00:35:07,009 --> 00:35:10,349
Barks was inconsistent sometimes. And then

431
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:15,827
Honestly, the colors were just inconsistent. Because these have been we printed over the years.

432
00:35:16,563 --> 00:35:17,063
They're...

433
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:30,194
I saw some reference a couple episodes ago when I was doing research, that there's, like, a hypothetical fourth nephew you called fo, which is the name that fans use when they give like a random purple coloring

434
00:35:30,574 --> 00:35:43,775
for some reason to the hat. No. Sure. But but that's interesting that you guys both noticed those birds, right, the the perspective shots of the birds because I noticed that this time, and I definitely didn't as a kid that he really enjoyed drawing

435
00:35:44,673 --> 00:35:45,891
drawing some of the birds

436
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,205
in this because there's a lot of random shots,

437
00:35:50,062 --> 00:35:50,841
you know, even

438
00:35:51,220 --> 00:36:01,080
when the nephew he's talking about hearing the humming sound. There seems to be like Gladstone or something flying. And and I looked it up because I was curious if this is possible.

439
00:36:01,474 --> 00:36:03,608
Right, If you could accidentally

440
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:06,039
change rivers from the Ohio

441
00:36:06,496 --> 00:36:07,453
to the Mississippi,

442
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,359
and no one answer this explicitly because it's a ridiculous question.

443
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:21,580
But by looking up the the system of of locks and stuff that are in between the two rivers, I figured out that no, you you could not do this.

444
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:26,246
Even back then when fewer of these locks were in place. So...

445
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:28,920
Ruin the story for myself

446
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,760
retroactively But that's okay. For the narrative

447
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:32,839
this has.

448
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,694
Alright. So on page seventeen, Donald goes to investigate that piling that they were tied to.

449
00:36:39,194 --> 00:36:45,230
And when he projects it, they they realized that it's actually a Barks scope. They've have been anchor to a submarine

450
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:55,245
all night that towed them down river. They they see that the Periscope the subs emerges. And they noticed that there's a trail of bubbles that

451
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:59,645
lets them know where it's going. So they decide to follow it. And

452
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:06,731
to be more efficient. Donald gets out foldable din. The phone will ding i'd love to get one of those that's impressive.

453
00:37:07,264 --> 00:37:13,352
I know. It looks handy. There's a neat little gag shot of a scared looking fish diving

454
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:17,775
out of the way of the bubbles that I really like. Yes. Barks

455
00:37:18,413 --> 00:37:23,777
doesn't do a ton of those little shots, but he he has fun with those. And then,

456
00:37:24,194 --> 00:37:25,372
you know, Don Rose

457
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:26,824
who writes

458
00:37:27,243 --> 00:37:36,388
stories later, He he really takes it a little farther and he kinda cramp them in. And they're they're pretty funny. We also got a little bit of Cartoon physics as the periscope

459
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:43,535
pops back down into the water and the and the rope that they tied around it is still hovering around it. Yeah. And it was clearly.

460
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:50,095
Exactly. It hasn't read the book about how gravity works yet Al why Coyote does. So that's right.

461
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,730
Alright. So on page eighteen,

462
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,010
the nephews are looking on

463
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,490
at Donald

464
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,421
pursuit, but it's over pretty quickly

465
00:37:59,998 --> 00:38:02,293
as the serpent surfaces

466
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:10,610
right away, and he motors right into its gaping mouth. I really like I really like this shot of donald

467
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:17,625
freaked out. Even if you know it's a fake serpent, you don't wanna go down that throughout. And then the nephews

468
00:38:18,365 --> 00:38:25,385
are crying out as the serpent fling the boat with its tail right out of the water. I like the donald mix a recognizable

469
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:27,517
sound as he

470
00:38:27,895 --> 00:38:30,271
he realizes he said it for the mouth. Work

471
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:32,706
universally yelp of surprise.

472
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:37,189
And page nineteen, the boat lands in the upper branches of a tree.

473
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:40,499
And the kids are mu over how they can track

474
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:41,417
and

475
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:47,254
capture or send subdue the serpent And they come up with a a plan.

476
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,886
I think it's a really great plan

477
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:51,042
considering

478
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,797
what they've got to work with.

479
00:38:53,134 --> 00:38:58,236
So they're gonna split up Huey, and dewey are gonna go rent a large tug boat

480
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:06,310
so that they can yank it out of the water, And Louis gonna charter a a plane to to find that trail of bubbles.

481
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,470
Kids meet back at that newly rented boat, and they're off.

482
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:16,485
And then they don't really mention it, but this is kind of the last of of the... Their house boat.

483
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:24,892
Right? Like, we don't acknowledge it, but they're not gonna be in it anymore. And, you know, I guess it's it's kinda of real realistic a realistic touch. How do you get a house

484
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,727
tree? You don't?

485
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:30,772
Nice house now. Yeah. That's true. Yeah.

486
00:39:31,665 --> 00:39:38,636
There is one point two as they're talking... Discussing their plan in the in the tree. You can see a little nest with a grumpy bird. And it's

487
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:45,133
scaling at them. That's not where they belong. Another little bird reference and another little site guy. Yeah.

488
00:39:45,891 --> 00:39:47,443
Alright. So on

489
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,737
page twenty,

490
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:57,509
the kids arrive at the island in the channel where Louis had seen the surface trail bubbles. And they get to searching.

491
00:39:57,888 --> 00:39:59,307
And they're so distracted

492
00:39:59,726 --> 00:40:03,662
by their search that they don't hear a large river but approach

493
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:10,629
until the river about has to signal a collision by choosing its sworn. They're g River about captain,

494
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:12,027
chives the Nephews,

495
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:15,772
He calls them blind river Al, rats,

496
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:20,262
Well, the Periscope is popped up and looks on. And

497
00:40:20,615 --> 00:40:24,551
this is the first time that we hear some monologue coming from the scope

498
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:29,546
as the voice sees opportunity to test out the serpent

499
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,200
And so the Nephews are explaining that they're searching for a c disturbance to the captain

500
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,080
who is very skeptical.

501
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,172
And the levels ominous

502
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,168
approach the boats.

503
00:40:41,626 --> 00:40:45,018
A sea serpent he says, S ser r p e n t.

504
00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:48,885
Yes. That's you have to say when you're when you're c.

505
00:40:49,302 --> 00:40:50,002
You can

506
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:50,840
accent.

507
00:40:51,497 --> 00:40:52,995
Yeah. He does have he

508
00:40:53,373 --> 00:40:54,351
you pay access

509
00:40:54,985 --> 00:41:00,725
Alright. So on page twenty one, as the captain is continuing to tell the nephews off,

510
00:41:01,145 --> 00:41:02,140
the serpent

511
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:03,059
emerges.

512
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:04,736
Just utterly

513
00:41:05,435 --> 00:41:08,571
terrifying the ship's passion passengers and crew

514
00:41:09,085 --> 00:41:12,485
and the Frightened and captain calls out for full speed ahead.

515
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:15,065
And then the nephews cannot

516
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:20,000
continue their purse pursuit because the boats engine room has been swamped.

517
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,080
And they just sit in the bow

518
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,840
disgusted while the serpent,

519
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,810
the serpents operator sales away, laughing.

520
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:40,623
I feel like the perspective shot here as the serpent towers over the big the big river boats, the serpent gotta be twice as big. This what's in the previous pages.

521
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:46,189
Oh, you think we're getting some scale change. Yeah. Could be. Yeah. Al little king con versus

522
00:41:46,946 --> 00:41:48,922
Syndrome, you know? You gotta. And like...

523
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,890
I like that he's playing around a little bit with panel

524
00:41:52,388 --> 00:41:54,204
composition here to kind of yeah.

525
00:41:54,702 --> 00:41:56,679
The surfing in. I don't think he

526
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:59,931
felt like he could do that. Too much previous to this.

527
00:42:00,465 --> 00:42:06,977
Well, that kinda shot you could expect, you know, you kinda want you wanna be able to do it at a full panel it'd be a great on just a single page, that shot.

528
00:42:07,617 --> 00:42:08,117
But

529
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:15,330
yet the more story. And you to edited it down. So it's a good way of being creative and not just sticking to just your.

530
00:42:16,164 --> 00:42:23,016
Yeah. You're right. This this one definitely called out for at at least a half page, if not a full a full page.

531
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:32,801
That one is probably the one I'm gonna pick for my favorite panel. I think it's a great a great panel here. Alright. So on the next page,

532
00:42:33,773 --> 00:42:38,478
twenty two, we transition to the inside of the sub.

533
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:41,210
We get a really great look

534
00:42:41,946 --> 00:42:44,977
at the right? Because we get a shot of the interior.

535
00:42:45,436 --> 00:42:48,133
We get a shot of the serpents

536
00:42:48,671 --> 00:42:49,171
retract

537
00:42:49,645 --> 00:42:57,665
into the sub from from outside and under underwater. We see how the sub moves on the bottom of the river

538
00:42:58,045 --> 00:43:00,892
with some pretty cool looking tread.

539
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:08,943
I I really like how we get to learn all about the mechanics of it Inducks, a really barcode number of panels.

540
00:43:09,361 --> 00:43:13,653
And we see a captain Donald and a lee looking man

541
00:43:14,111 --> 00:43:16,807
that we've already talked about the scare

542
00:43:17,799 --> 00:43:23,647
The scare is looking at the steam through a screen. He is just laughing...

543
00:43:24,664 --> 00:43:30,295
Laughing is head off at their Right, he's having a great time. He's celebrating his invention

544
00:43:31,035 --> 00:43:34,150
and he reveals that his mission is to scare

545
00:43:34,649 --> 00:43:39,504
everyone on the banks the river. He wants to just generally soak confusion and tear.

546
00:43:40,043 --> 00:43:44,273
And then he's gonna sc his serpent his machine ultimately,

547
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:47,824
and he wants to just disappear into legend.

548
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:49,021
And

549
00:43:49,558 --> 00:43:54,347
Donald ask him why? He says that this is why...

550
00:43:54,726 --> 00:44:01,195
Why why do people dance? This is what he likes to do. This is what brings him joy. It's his it's his hobby.

551
00:44:01,692 --> 00:44:04,745
And he's just looking forward to spending the rest of his life

552
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:07,396
laughing at all the people and he's scared.

553
00:44:08,209 --> 00:44:14,451
And he also tells Donald. He's not gonna be able to reveal anything because he's gonna bury him

554
00:44:15,546 --> 00:44:18,393
in the river mud along with disturbance.

555
00:44:19,231 --> 00:44:21,048
A lot going on on this page.

556
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:29,081
Any thoughts gentlemen about the scare, Eric What do you think? So he just wants to be

557
00:44:29,498 --> 00:44:33,565
a really popular anonymous troll as in using today's vernacular.

558
00:44:34,044 --> 00:44:35,102
He wants to

559
00:44:35,575 --> 00:44:58,045
have this one inside joke that he's the only person who laughed Al. And when he fooled everybody else. He's gonna walk out that superior knowledge of I got the best of them because everyone else is an idiot. And that's enough for him. Yeah. I I I read him the exact same way I thought of him Al as, like, a precursor to an Internet troll. What about you, Ryan? I think if I'm him and I'm planning this out,

560
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,817
and I don't wanna kill anybody. I'm picturing Donald.

561
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:12,121
Setting donald free. And people going Did you see that sea serpent to through a ship across the river like it was it like it was a thumb tag, you know? And and

562
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:24,801
Donald going up to them and saying, no. No. No. No. It's not a real sea serpent. It's just one crazy guy he's in an underwater tank that just drives along the bottom of the river, and it has a big vacuum pump that inflate a big forty foot c serpent.

563
00:45:25,295 --> 00:45:32,228
And people going you're crazy man. Why are you telling this crazy story? I I saw the sea serpent and it was huge. I think honestly,

564
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:36,760
the Giant River monster strip is probably more close then the under water saying.

565
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:42,520
No. He said he would bore it into the ground and it would be buried under the mod and no one would ever find this.

566
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:43,820
Okay, buddy.

567
00:45:44,395 --> 00:45:46,533
Yeah. Admittedly, it's a pretty...

568
00:45:46,992 --> 00:45:50,529
It's a pretty incredible machine. You know, this the scare,

569
00:45:50,908 --> 00:45:53,326
he's got some real talent. Right? He could've

570
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:10,515
he could've put it to use in the war effort. But if I know, he he just loves to scare people And, you know, I'm not I'm not in love with the, like, the character design on the scare himself. He's, like, really sc, pretty interesting.

571
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:19,345
But I'd I love the concept. I think... I think it's a really unique concept. I think there's something very pure about I just like scare

572
00:46:20,841 --> 00:46:30,207
It it it is a nice change pace from the pirate who's using to steal stuff. That ends up being ill and every Scooby doo movie or Ex

573
00:46:30,544 --> 00:46:31,044
episode.

574
00:46:31,699 --> 00:46:33,913
That of a monster to get into

575
00:46:34,305 --> 00:46:38,660
perk game and him. It's... No. It's for Personal fulfillment, which is Yeah.

576
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:42,375
If. Yeah. He's he's not in it for the well.

577
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:48,723
He's not even in it for the fame in the sense because he's he's just in it for that sense of self

578
00:46:49,302 --> 00:46:50,521
satisfaction. On

579
00:46:50,835 --> 00:46:56,895
my page twenty three, the nephews are continuing to pursue. For keeping an eye for those bubbles,

580
00:46:57,195 --> 00:46:59,750
and we get to follow the scares

581
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,990
trail of Mayhem and a wreckage,

582
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,810
including a smashed yacht club, an overturned River boat,

583
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:10,965
and they observed the coast guard searching for

584
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:17,217
the serpent in in pt boats and they realized that they can't reveal

585
00:47:17,596 --> 00:47:22,903
what they know about tracking the serpent because they see the government would drop death Bomb is newman donald.

586
00:47:23,361 --> 00:47:25,578
The scare is is monitoring

587
00:47:25,956 --> 00:47:31,460
the nephews in their effort. And he brag to donald about how he's never gonna be caught,

588
00:47:31,797 --> 00:47:46,632
and Donald lets this slip that his nephews track him by the bubbles. And then the scare reveals that he can turn those off at any time. You guys know what a pt bonus is? Yeah Will both. I don't I played god ship.

589
00:47:47,528 --> 00:47:48,600
Yeah. It's a patrol

590
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:49,679
torpedo

591
00:47:50,257 --> 00:47:59,434
specifically, I think. Oh, really? Yeah. This was like, in the earlier days of of tracking subs then would like, I think literally just drop

592
00:48:00,132 --> 00:48:01,131
the depth charges.

593
00:48:01,611 --> 00:48:05,148
Sure. I like how in a single page, Carl has

594
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:06,466
conveyed

595
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,599
the scares

596
00:48:08,097 --> 00:48:11,470
plans succeeding. That we see frame after frame of all these boats

597
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:15,041
smashed and over to her and people panicking and, you know,

598
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:24,149
military searches and although it did seem out of character with all the previous issues I've read to have Donald who usually

599
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:26,626
is pretty quick about kind of evaluating

600
00:48:27,045 --> 00:48:35,382
situation he's in and figuring out, you know, what what he needs to do to to come out on top to just kind of blow his his ace here and

601
00:48:35,718 --> 00:48:56,830
let the guy know, you know, the only way that that the nephews are tracking it. Gotta imagine he's probably getting little light headed from Hunger or whatever at this point. Yeah. Sure. I I just I look I looked those panels that I did all that pt bone and all Al these things like what ways to taxpayer money searching for c serpent that they may may never find service.

602
00:48:57,486 --> 00:48:59,041
Alright. So on

603
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:02,081
on page twenty four, the nephews

604
00:49:02,821 --> 00:49:06,495
are passing over the now concealed sub,

605
00:49:06,796 --> 00:49:07,296
and

606
00:49:07,596 --> 00:49:10,356
they they pass it right by. And they missed it.

607
00:49:11,036 --> 00:49:13,396
And they arrived days later.

608
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,268
In the Delta country

609
00:49:15,805 --> 00:49:17,183
near the Gulf of Mexico.

610
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,498
And, you know, we can tell

611
00:49:19,836 --> 00:49:22,145
immediately, again, we can see that transition

612
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:24,400
from the Ohio Severino the wider

613
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:28,132
Mississippi, We can now see the the delta style

614
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:30,286
where we see a bunch of reads

615
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,420
and

616
00:49:31,799 --> 00:49:39,111
a cool sense of geography here, I think as they discussed the fact that, you know, they seem to have missed him and they wanna turn around.

617
00:49:39,883 --> 00:49:57,921
They they decide now we're gonna go around just one more river band. And so when they round that bend, they see an old rec ship and Huey,, if we go by the red hat, gets the idea to h to the stern of the ship and to flow the rack down the river to use as bait for the scare.

618
00:49:58,441 --> 00:49:59,939
Lots more birds in these panels.

619
00:50:00,278 --> 00:50:01,437
Yeah. Also,

620
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:05,898
Boy, there's a lot of defeat conveyed in the words days later.

621
00:50:06,275 --> 00:50:13,292
I've just... These boys have been, you know, in their rented tug boat, they've crossed pretty much the entire country from top to bottom now,

622
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:17,406
and Donald is still just tied to a post on

623
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:26,111
bottom of the river. Yeah. Even Al little transition bubble that says days later somehow looks looks like disappointed or something.

624
00:50:26,711 --> 00:50:26,791
Yeah.

625
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:28,623
Alright. And

626
00:50:28,961 --> 00:50:30,698
so on the next page,

627
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,053
twenty five,

628
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:36,580
we also see that the scare

629
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:39,616
and Donald are approaching the delta.

630
00:50:40,195 --> 00:50:44,865
And the stair decides that it's just about time to go ahead and sc,

631
00:50:45,205 --> 00:50:45,945
the submarine.

632
00:50:46,445 --> 00:50:52,285
The he too is gonna round one more ever band, which sends some fear through Donald.

633
00:50:52,941 --> 00:51:00,320
And as he rounds the band, he's glad that he's waited a bit more because he does see that bates steam through his paris.

634
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,255
He takes the bait

635
00:51:02,755 --> 00:51:04,294
and the serpent emerges

636
00:51:04,633 --> 00:51:06,111
for the last time,

637
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,646
and Huey, doing Louis are so excited that they

638
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,576
They accept their words. These are called spoon.

639
00:51:16,313 --> 00:51:18,132
Hop the bulk instead of

640
00:51:18,685 --> 00:51:21,398
drop out the hulk and wrap grove and... Yeah.

641
00:51:22,156 --> 00:51:23,175
So the scare

642
00:51:24,111 --> 00:51:26,540
realizes very quickly that he's been tricked

643
00:51:27,198 --> 00:51:34,331
and we can see that Donald is relieved. You think he's got a fighting chance here. And then on page twenty six,

644
00:51:35,104 --> 00:51:39,994
the nephews basically have one chance to stop the Severino serpent.

645
00:51:40,372 --> 00:51:47,992
They managed to get the tug line looped around its neck. And then they're, like, locked in a very deadly tug war.

646
00:51:48,769 --> 00:51:50,785
And the the submarine is initially

647
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,673
proving that it's too strong.

648
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:57,544
The mascara is pulling the nephews back towards the deeper water.

649
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:15,980
And they're they're alarms, so they signal the tug whistle to call for help. And, you know, I really like this page it when it feels like Al dangerous. You know this this feels like a very deadly deadly game here. Yeah. You can hear the suspense climax

650
00:52:16,957 --> 00:52:21,800
music in the background as you read it. For sure. Pun by the whistles

651
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,732
the whistles sound.

652
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:24,844
And

653
00:52:25,182 --> 00:52:26,538
so on page twenty seven,

654
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:31,267
the scare is able to hear the whistle through the serpent

655
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:39,060
which freaks him out because that indicates that the throw valve has been broken and and this allows water to rush into the submarine.

656
00:52:39,675 --> 00:52:44,935
And the scare turns into the scared now as he

657
00:52:46,235 --> 00:52:54,156
is is freaked out there's a summary is filling up with water. He threatens the nephews that if they keep going, their uncle gonna drown.

658
00:52:54,675 --> 00:52:58,701
But Donald calls through the valve he eggs on the nephews

659
00:52:59,038 --> 00:52:59,538
and

660
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:08,846
gives them reason to know that he's still alive and Donald points out to the scare that he has no choice, but to stop or he is doomed

661
00:53:09,423 --> 00:53:10,322
and the scare

662
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:18,113
goes to pull the lever that will stop the sub, and he spares and Huey, Barks someone he can't scare. But then

663
00:53:18,569 --> 00:53:19,348
the scare

664
00:53:19,685 --> 00:53:27,791
realizes that his lever is jammed he believes that he is doomed And, you know, looking at this page, I like how

665
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,051
I like how Barks

666
00:53:30,825 --> 00:53:37,502
shows how terrified the scares become. Right? Very polite. Yeah. There's a lot of sweat coming off of him.

667
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,683
I'm sure it's very humid down there.

668
00:53:41,241 --> 00:53:41,741
Probably.

669
00:53:42,635 --> 00:53:46,256
Problem, you know, Remember water. Come in. I I like how

670
00:53:46,714 --> 00:53:54,171
like in the previous page, he he sent me a concern and he starts with with, but as that goes on, like, by the final spot, he's just

671
00:53:54,949 --> 00:54:02,646
amplifying the wire that's in the sub itself with then all the sweat bubbles coming off and. Yeah. He's getting progressively and more freaked to out.

672
00:54:03,105 --> 00:54:07,721
And then that really escalate on page twenty eight, the last page of the story

673
00:54:08,299 --> 00:54:08,799
where

674
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,371
he's like he's so freaked out that he's pretty much cat.

675
00:54:13,031 --> 00:54:23,766
He collapsed is with Fried. Donald will yell at him to cut him loose so he can stop the sub. And the scare, the pet and loose, And then Donald just smash the battery,

676
00:54:24,086 --> 00:54:28,066
stopping the sub, and then he just bash the scare

677
00:54:28,579 --> 00:54:30,733
over the head, stopping him,

678
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:31,791
and

679
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:33,905
then we get a really cool visual

680
00:54:34,322 --> 00:54:37,832
where Donald emerges from the Sharpen throat.

681
00:54:38,406 --> 00:54:39,745
He greet his nephews

682
00:54:40,164 --> 00:54:45,758
with the acknowledgment, how men, you know, because they've really earned that they've proven themselves.

683
00:54:46,557 --> 00:54:50,591
And then we get a a neat transition that wraps up the story

684
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:53,431
a couple days later after the capture,

685
00:54:53,811 --> 00:54:56,751
the debts have received fame and glory.

686
00:54:57,225 --> 00:55:15,871
But they're they're missing in their house both. Donald tells them to meet him at the pier where Uncle Sam referring to the government is gonna give them a new ship in the net queues are surprised to see when they get there that they've got the scares old sub which seems to be retrofitted into a boat, and now the serpent

687
00:55:16,425 --> 00:55:26,949
The serpent is still there, but he looks a lot more c. And they get played off? They get a a hero send off with the band celebrating with them with anchors away. Is the navy

688
00:55:27,326 --> 00:55:28,743
unofficial Barks song.

689
00:55:30,993 --> 00:55:34,676
And that was the the serpent has smile and its face in the last panel.

690
00:55:35,156 --> 00:55:40,136
Like, almost a proud looking smile. And that that is our reading

691
00:55:40,636 --> 00:55:45,022
of the care of the river before I talk about the the general

692
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:46,219
consensus.

693
00:55:47,036 --> 00:55:52,383
What did you guys think of this story? Ryan, why don't you go first? I I thought it was definitely

694
00:55:52,922 --> 00:56:03,531
slower, than the other issues I read. I feel like the other ones were much more tightly packed with stuff happening, and this one has a lot more of just floating around.

695
00:56:04,091 --> 00:56:04,591
And

696
00:56:05,051 --> 00:56:10,320
they thinking about things and noticing odd things and learning about voting and

697
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:20,747
before we get to the, you know, the the final face on here in the in the river with that last abandoned hope. Right on. Yeah. It kind of kinda... The pacing kinda matches

698
00:56:21,283 --> 00:56:31,378
the action of floating down the river. What about you era? Oh, I'm liked to. I thought it was, you know, you know, pretty well done with all the other ones that the...

699
00:56:31,796 --> 00:56:49,807
The long story you have the intro where they're doing something has nothing to do with the actual tear, and then they get dragged in to it, which seems like it's a common thread where, you know, they're just gonna go do something and all of a sudden, they get pulled in some random and the adventure. They're not out there seeking that adventure.

700
00:56:50,146 --> 00:56:55,296
They get pulled into it, and it's it's that I liked it. It was a nice president

701
00:56:56,114 --> 00:56:56,774
with this

702
00:56:57,632 --> 00:56:58,412
the final

703
00:56:58,830 --> 00:58:01,805
the aspect that it was good with, you know, the the it then they had to track it down. So wasn't just finding the bill and and facing him they were actually in pursuit of them. We his donald was peril, which seems to really the nephews apparel and Donald trying to save them. Yeah. I mean, I I like the... I like the real peril and a lot of these early stories. It sounds like you guys both enjoyed this one, but maybe didn't love it. This one I... I'm a big fan of this one. This is probably one of my favorites of the earlier bark stories. And I did get this one pretty early on when I was collecting and reading these side I read it over and over and over. But I really love just the, like, the different aspects of it, how it... It shows, you know, the the romantic aspect of navigating the Mississippi in the Ohio river, and I loved I was kind of obsessed with c sharpen and monsters of that type. So It hit my sweet spot in that way. But I love the the design as I mentioned of the serpent.

704
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:08,965
I really liked the villain. Even if he himself wasn't that memorable, I really like his motivation

705
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:14,760
So big fan of this one. As as far as how this one is regarded,

706
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:22,428
this one is considered a classic by Barks fans for kind of the reasons I've mentioned, you know, it it shows that

707
00:58:22,806 --> 00:58:25,342
kind of classic American appreciation of the rivers.

708
00:58:26,359 --> 00:58:28,030
I think the villain Al well like

709
00:58:28,689 --> 00:58:30,147
the c serpent.

710
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:37,052
This one on the index web page where users can submit their rankings.

711
00:58:37,525 --> 00:58:40,874
This one's got a seven point seven out of ten,

712
00:58:42,389 --> 00:58:46,815
which puts it above any of the other stories that we've read so far.

713
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:51,130
Previously frozen wool was the highest rated of these

714
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:56,859
with a seven point six. This one's in the ninety nine point six six percentile.

715
00:58:57,594 --> 00:59:02,078
Number number one hundred and thirty eight out of the roughly forty thousand

716
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:08,403
some Disney stories that users have ranked on the site. So this one definitely is very law regard

717
00:59:08,742 --> 00:59:20,380
among the the fan base. I think it really holds up, and I really like this one. I I do think, you know, it it definitely is kind of like of its time. Right? Because it's talking.

718
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,180
It's showing a lot of

719
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,900
the the war stuff is still the background, you know, like the pt boats.

720
00:59:27,534 --> 00:59:35,292
Cruising and just the general paranoia of it. But I I like that there's not really anything that's I I didn't see anything

721
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:38,540
problematic in this one that I kinda had to excuse

722
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,420
as being of its time,

723
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,380
you know, there was definitely some stuff that was, like, a little dated or archaic.

724
00:59:45,895 --> 00:59:50,875
Just the the pole burning shift that they passed, the whole concept of a p boat.

725
00:59:51,575 --> 01:00:03,315
We still use the term uncle Sam, but I don't think that's very very, like salient these days. And I noticed that that same where they said now we're cooking with atomic gas, that was kind of a two little

726
01:00:04,175 --> 01:00:09,730
thought that you wouldn't you wouldn't hear today. As far as appearances is another media, I mentioned that

727
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:12,130
Bark did do a painting

728
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:16,950
of this one that is very well like among fans.

729
01:00:17,524 --> 01:00:22,652
If you guys have a moment, you can maybe Google it on your end because it's pretty cool one It's got

730
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,900
really nice Ducktales to pick

731
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:27,538
of the c serpent.

732
01:00:27,997 --> 01:00:30,894
I don't think that this one that they ever

733
01:00:31,433 --> 01:00:33,831
adopted this into any of the Ducktales

734
01:00:33,991 --> 01:00:34,491
stories,

735
01:00:35,005 --> 01:00:43,345
I don't think the scare has ever appeared again that I'm aware of, which I think is too bad because I think this would have made a cool concept

736
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:55,641
And, you know, if Barks brought back villains that he really liked. Right? He brings back to People boys and Gone and magic could is spell, but even if he's not as memorable, you know, his his whole

737
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:06,104
idea could have made for some some more interesting follow ups stories. I think. Yeah. And and again, it's a shame because the character design, I think so cool on that serpent.

738
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:11,035
I felt like, you know, I always like, to talk about what I learned from this one,

739
01:01:11,475 --> 01:01:12,455
educational value.

740
01:01:13,395 --> 01:01:15,335
I feel like I learned a lot about

741
01:01:15,635 --> 01:01:20,935
river and navigation she actually. I mean, the rules are not actually that useful,

742
01:01:21,352 --> 01:01:26,735
but kind of the idea that it's it's hard to navigate a house down the river.

743
01:01:27,115 --> 01:01:35,228
And then it's just full of of nautical terms that, you know, things like boat hook hook and Star and the stern and piling

744
01:01:35,886 --> 01:01:41,335
that I'm sure as a kid, that was the first time that I I encountered most of those terms.

745
01:01:41,673 --> 01:01:46,856
So we let's talk about favorite panels, if you guys had a chance to think about it.

746
01:01:47,313 --> 01:01:53,157
I I did tip my hat that... I really love the panel that shows the C serpent

747
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:56,207
looming over that steam

748
01:01:56,706 --> 01:01:59,303
scaring the the g c captain.

749
01:02:00,062 --> 01:02:02,535
But there's a lot really really neat panels,

750
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:09,358
all my favorites that are gonna involve that that c serpent. I also really like the one that shows him retract

751
01:02:09,736 --> 01:02:10,850
into the sub

752
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:15,370
underneath the water. Eric. Why don't you if you have one in mind?

753
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:19,585
I don't don't know. Just because just give them a fan up the art and

754
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:24,929
in the other episodes other stuff we've had. I've always looked for those really neat

755
01:02:25,306 --> 01:02:32,570
big half panels that looks this beautiful scene that he to pay and you didn't really get many of those in here. But I did like

756
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:33,570
when

757
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,870
the the nephew is on night,

758
01:02:36,603 --> 01:02:43,780
and the use of, again, use of silhouette to pay in a very stark and very different kind of issue that you're used these.

759
01:02:44,438 --> 01:03:38,841
And the one where he with the with the sun but the full moon and the bird flying in front of it, and nephew was slightly me shade. I think that just to me that's that's pretty. And I I really like that one. And being a visual medium, I kinda look for the things that catch by eye and yours with the giant surfing over the boat certainly they do, but that one one uses the dark to to pay the picture, it just to me really pops out from the typical color scenes that you see and everything else. Yeah. I'm I'm an easy day. I'm a cheat date. I I love a good c sharpen panel. But I'm I'm looking at the one you mentioned, and you're you're right. That's a pool panel. It's got a really neat erie vibe to it as well. He also does a really good job of using the reflection of the water of carrying the of the boat through onto the water and not just in the that eight there's several other instances were there's a still seeing where he has a nice

760
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:40,557
using the the

761
01:03:40,895 --> 01:03:49,124
the river itself to extend the make sure. And but we're detailed of the same. Yeah. Ryan, What about you? I think my favorite is

762
01:03:49,825 --> 01:03:55,643
the the couple cooking breakfast on the roof of their house and flat out Ohio. Just casually

763
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,005
sit around. I don't remember if he has the newspaper now. I'd have to go back. But

764
01:03:59,742 --> 01:04:01,637
And then I think my second favorite would be

765
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:05,423
the moment where Donald turns around and sees the c serpent

766
01:04:05,959 --> 01:04:19,688
right in front of him for the first time and and his mouth is open. His beak is open, like a hundred and fifty degrees probably. It's not quite not quite a hundred and eighty, but he is well And truly freaking out in that frame. And it is very

767
01:04:20,425 --> 01:04:35,383
adequately conveyed in the artwork. Yeah. Both both great choices I I love also the fact that the boys... The nephew you started out this story wearing your typical hats. But once they got the river, they're all wearing sailor just like you're bottle.

768
01:04:35,902 --> 01:04:37,641
That's right they're now

769
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:39,319
and no longer

770
01:04:39,699 --> 01:05:01,499
adventures like, they wear the hats and every other adventure. Every other time you see, they're always hands the minute they hit the water. The little sailor caps just like mcdonald's completely colors skewed in together. And I just... It's a small detail, but it's finn has stick. Yeah. It's got the little the little details even and Donald not wearing his. He's got a captain hat. I never ever even picked up on that. Awesome.

771
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,380
Any

772
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:13,388
any closing thoughts from you guys anything that we didn't talk about in this one that you wanted to mention? This this starting to remind me of of some maybe silver age Marvel,

773
01:05:14,446 --> 01:05:15,640
getting a villain like this

774
01:05:16,217 --> 01:05:16,877
who is,

775
01:05:17,294 --> 01:05:19,149
you know, mortally dangerous,

776
01:05:19,526 --> 01:05:20,026
but

777
01:05:20,363 --> 01:05:20,863
also

778
01:05:21,279 --> 01:05:22,218
kind of weird.

779
01:05:24,244 --> 01:05:28,853
Is like something the fantastic four would have fought in the sixties. You know what I mean? Yeah. And

780
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:31,407
and and and Eric's comments

781
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,340
a minute ago were reminds me of of...

782
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,860
Yeah. Yeah. There's no twenty first century comic that would have

783
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:45,067
twelve panels on a page for page after page after page. I mean, they are really just cram it in tight.

784
01:05:45,565 --> 01:06:06,870
You know, any any modern comment is gonna have... There's probably one page that's like a double page spread, and there's one that's just one full page, and they're doing a lot of really different things. And this one, you know, we noted when he he experimented with the one panel that's kind of shaped, like, like home based or, like, super superman chest logo or something that was such a big departure from just the square square where all the way down.

785
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:08,446
Which is very

786
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:19,744
very dense. Yeah. And I I think I'd read somewhere that early on. They didn't really give him much freedom like it. That it was a Ducktales that he pretty much stick with the traditional panels.

787
01:06:20,484 --> 01:06:24,104
Yeah. Excellent. Well, thank you guys both for

788
01:06:24,884 --> 01:06:25,864
for joining

789
01:06:26,364 --> 01:06:28,419
me today. I really appreciate it.

790
01:06:28,779 --> 01:06:31,239
Hello. I have with me an actual

791
01:06:31,699 --> 01:06:43,006
child for our Ask kids segment. Actual child. What is your name? And Mia. Mia. And what great are you in? India? I'm about to be in fifth grade. Awesome.

792
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:55,384
So mia, you read tara of the river with me. Can you tell me what what did you think about it? I thought it was one my favorite ones. I liked how the caesar

793
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:58,359
wasn't really a c It was just someone

794
01:06:58,897 --> 01:07:08,150
inside who built a really cool robot? Nice. What you think about the scare? I thought he wasn't really scary when you look Al him.

795
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:16,024
He is scary when you... When like he's like, scaring from the inside of the sea serpent.

796
01:07:16,444 --> 01:07:16,884
Nice.

797
01:07:17,444 --> 01:07:24,991
Did you have any other favorite parts of this story. I liked it when Donald the gets swallowed.

798
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:25,870
Pharmacy

799
01:07:26,862 --> 01:07:32,831
I like that part too. Let's see. Did this one make you feel like you wanted to

800
01:07:33,169 --> 01:07:33,949
try house

801
01:07:34,367 --> 01:07:36,299
on the Ohio River at Yeah.

802
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:39,639
I think it would be really interesting

803
01:07:40,299 --> 01:07:42,734
to live on a house boat. Excellent

804
01:07:43,313 --> 01:08:02,914
Alright. Well, thank you very much, mia. If any listeners have any thoughts or comments, you guys can drop us a line at Barks remarks at g mail dot com. And I hope you'll join us next time when we talk about Donald Du Adam Bomb. Thank you, everyone.
