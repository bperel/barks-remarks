00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:14,984
Greetings, Carl Marx fans. You are about to listen to the very first episode of Mark's remarks.

2
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:33,585
If you are new to the podcast, you should know that this first episode is pretty rough. And I have learned a lot about audio quality and sound editing since recording this one. And also, the format of the show has evolved quite a bit as I've figured out what really works in these episodes.

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:59,560
So if you want to start at the beginning, that's great. Welcome aboard. But if you're if you're listening to get a taste for what the podcast is like. I really suggest starting with a slightly later episode. Maybe choose one of your personal favorite stories that we recorded. The audio quality on this one is pretty rough and there's some background noise. Both of which are issues that are pretty much addressed in future episodes.

4
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:04,295
That said, thank you very much for giving a podcast to try and hope you'll stick with us.

5
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:32,434

Going back to when I was about eight years old last

00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:19,935

17
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:21,591

Tell us a little bit about your experience with Carl Barks stories. Please Eric?

19
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:28,635
On mike smith how Barks.

20
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:35,877
Well, I was familiar with like Ducktales stories for Al long time Barks used me to the carl Barks aspect of them,

21
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,365
but having gone red through,

22
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:42,032
and what you show guys, there's some of the storylines lines

23
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:43,351
from those

24
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:47,480
and and the Barks. And I've just been really appreciative of

25
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:50,157
the history and the work that you put into

26
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:51,555
creating

27
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:52,474
the

28
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:53,992
doc universe

29
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:55,230
screws particularly

30
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:57,644
who is one of my all time favorite

31
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,004
just characters,

32
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:00,924
whether it's comics, cartoons,

33
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:03,124
all around just fun

34
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:04,004
nuanced

35
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:04,984
characters.

36
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:06,098
Right on.

37
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:06,936
And

38
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:10,684
today, we are going to be talking

39
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,884
about Carl Barks very first long form adventure story

40
00:03:16,344 --> 00:03:19,604
called Donald Duck finds pirate gold.

41
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:24,704
I probably didn't say the exclamation point there, but there is Al exclamation point in the title.

42
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:27,733
Eric, had you read this one

43
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:28,810
before

44
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:31,043
we planned the podcast?

45
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,157
I don't think I did,

46
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:42,499
but I was familiar with So I I don't know. Maybe I had back in the day and read it somewhere. I don't know if do you have a copy or if I saw it on a reprint, because I know

47
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,777
Disney on occasion

48
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:47,174
for free Holiday day

49
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:48,791
the first Saturday May,

50
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,896
would always issue some old comics and rei school comments. I have some that are rei issues.

51
00:03:55,553 --> 00:04:07,114
Some of classic, disney comic stories from Barks from back in yesterday year. I don't know if I had this one or web, but I was reading it it Al felt very familiar. Like, I like I know Yellow be. I've seen him before

52
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:16,216
Yeah. Now that you mentioned that this one might have been one of the free comic day ones. But, yeah, let's let's dive in to a background

53
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:17,549
on.

54
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:20,549
And this story was originally

55
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:23,429
published in October of nineteen

56
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:25,069
forty two

57
00:04:25,903 --> 00:04:26,403
in

58
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:33,738
the old con series four color, this was four color number nine. This was before

59
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:38,905
they started publishing under the imprint of, like, walt Disney's, comics and stories.

60
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:41,023
And so, Eric, I've

61
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:42,661
decided to

62
00:04:43,694 --> 00:04:47,504
have a little bit of context for what was going on at the time.

63
00:04:49,118 --> 00:04:51,013
I mean, in historical context or

64
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:53,047
oracle Barks. Yes.

65
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,017
That's right right. So

66
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:58,211
nineteen forty two, I mean, is...

67
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:03,814
Think I don't think amy was going on little bit It's pretty calm peaceful times. Yeah.

68
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:11,965
We... Well, we know we're we're in the height of World War two around this time. So it's an interesting time to be enjoying a funny comic

69
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,819
story.

70
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:17,982
Funny animal story, but people needed entertainment, of course.

71
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,120
So

72
00:05:19,537 --> 00:05:22,684
I look to at a couple of the

73
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,238
other events.

74
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,747
Something that I thought was interesting. This is when the little golden books started to publish.

75
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:34,913
A little going bush. Yes. So who hasn't read the Hook puppy?

76
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:40,014
Yeah. Well was I I was a big fan of twenty line. That

77
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,653
try. That's good.

78
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:42,112
So...

79
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:45,528
Anyway, that's feels very, like, appropriate.

80
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:50,017
Sure. You know, goes along with the funny animal books.

81
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:51,572
Other

82
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,563
notable things in real world,

83
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:01,912
this was during a time when Roosevelt had just in implemented a big wage and rent freeze.

84
00:06:02,568 --> 00:06:05,835
It was the debut of the Mighty mouse cartoon.

85
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:07,629
Really?

86
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:15,364
And then white Christmas was topping the charts at this time. So i a little more background.

87
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:17,644
This is a very long

88
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:18,844
comic

89
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:21,224
compared to most of the Barks stories.

90
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,534
It locks in at sixty

91
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:24,769
four pages.

92
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:27,719
Like most stories it's been reprinted

93
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,331
quite a few times.

94
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:37,135
I read this one as part of the Glad stone reprint and they did a giant album of it.

95
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:38,649
That was

96
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:40,226
a pretty neat release.

97
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:45,800
You know, this one draws a lot of attention just because it is

98
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:50,968
you know, this is our first step episode. So this is the first of the

99
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,899
long adventure stories but

100
00:06:54,316 --> 00:07:02,233
one of the misconceptions about it, It is not Carl Barks very first comment. U but she might hear people

101
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:06,756
share as a fact. He actually had one other before this. Called

102
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:13,635
Pluto saves the ship. I've never read it. So Okay. So this was his first dunk.

103
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:20,621
What this is the... Was is this the first dumped come though? Like, i exactly and his first

104
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:24,191
was it the first of the comics.

105
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:32,436
So I know that they did like... There was... There were newspaper comics strips before this. And I don't think they were

106
00:07:34,174 --> 00:07:37,650
collected or anything beforehand. So I don't know the answer to that.

107
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:43,783
So the this had a a bit of an unusual background and source

108
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,429
compared to most Barks. Comics.

109
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,189
This is actually

110
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:50,589
based on an

111
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:51,509
animated

112
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:54,644
story board for a Disney

113
00:07:55,544 --> 00:07:56,044
feature

114
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:57,524
that was

115
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,404
abandoned. Basically

116
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:00,597
Yeah.

117
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:06,403
At one point, Disney was going to do a feature that was gonna be called Morgan's

118
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:07,060
dose.

119
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:08,612
Okay.

120
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:09,808
And

121
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:19,357
they abandoned it. And at some point they were kind of hunting around for story ideas to include in their comics line.

122
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:20,396
And

123
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:25,650
Carl Marx was brought on because he he was working in the animation department.

124
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:27,124
At the time.

125
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:28,044
So

126
00:08:28,944 --> 00:08:29,444
they

127
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:31,284
passed him

128
00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:32,964
along with

129
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:34,784
That hannah.

130
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,220
Is the other artist who worked on this

131
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:39,699
to

132
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:42,940
adapt this story and the

133
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,954
the part So...

134
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:48,795
Yeah. This one definitely had a a

135
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:50,115
more unusual

136
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:55,439
background than most but it was well received enough for that mh

137
00:08:56,215 --> 00:08:56,715
publisher

138
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:05,070
would end up coming back to Barks and asked asking him to return to the well for for more stories.

139
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:10,439
And this, you know, is what became the beginning of his his legendary

140
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:13,919
career, really doing mostly these duck comics.

141
00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:16,774
Okay. Great yeah. So

142
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:25,845
As we go into these, I'm kind of working out the structure of the podcast a little bit, but I'm thinking we'll mention if there any notable appearances.

143
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,675
Before we actually dive into the substance of the story.

144
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:31,774
So

145
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:33,972
apart from the Nephews

146
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:35,570
and Donald

147
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:37,701
the the most

148
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:41,471
notable character and this has gotta be yellow leak. Right?

149
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:44,265
I'm thinking.

150
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:46,499
No. It's p, obviously.

151
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:50,899
The villain and the the classic Disney building who shows up in everything.

152
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:54,988
Yeah. It isn't it weird to see pete in

153
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:56,603
in a Ducktales

154
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:59,856
story. It it really is that you fight.

155
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:08,220
I think obviously this this his first time out, i think he's gonna go to the well of okay, sure where the villains that we have and it is the

156
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:12,250
comic first and, you know, at this point, pretty much just peaked.

157
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,286
Alright. And the universal, like like, you know, it's transferred over,

158
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:17,825
even his

159
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:18,918
his

160
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:22,628
hen man you gotta think later on now just be big voice

161
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:29,714
where if you think about it, i mean, I realize, I think he's supposed to be cat, but if you look at the

162
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:33,994
part type of what pee is how he's drawn

163
00:10:34,388 --> 00:10:39,552
He can kinda see how the big boys are a little bit model off of him the big bur

164
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:42,861
or whole kind of a character who's

165
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:45,154
imposing but not always

166
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:46,035
the

167
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,654
intellectual rival if you will.

168
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:50,690
Bureau a story.

169
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,089
But I'm always just

170
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,290
connecting enough.

171
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,730
I'm a huge peak fan personally.

172
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,450
Do you know my favorite trivia about

173
00:10:59,029 --> 00:10:59,585
about pete

174
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:06,695
No. What your favorite trivia about pete? He actually pre predicts mickey mouse.

175
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:13,782
They were... They they used Him a little bit before Mickey was introduced in some very early cartoons. So

176
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:20,115
pete goes way back formerly peg like p. But yes, Black pete is one of the big characters

177
00:11:20,855 --> 00:11:29,460
in this one. And then you mentioned as hen. Do they only name one of them Al Red eye, I think. Oh, I don't even know. I can't remember. I just... Yeah.

178
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:31,055
The generic

179
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:33,894
mouse type fill

180
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,095
guys that seem like they're an archetype of

181
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:38,995
Hang on moreover.

182
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:40,149
More?

183
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:45,178
Yeah. They look a lot like I I think they had to have been modeled after mo.

184
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:48,691
So anyway, that's that's some of the background

185
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:51,143
about this story.

186
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:56,835
Are you ready to dive into the the plot of the story such as it this?

187
00:11:57,688 --> 00:11:58,786
Sure. Excellent.

188
00:12:01,796 --> 00:12:02,296
Good.

189
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:05,542
Donald Duck finds higher gold,

190
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:08,613
has donald and the Nephews used cast

191
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,088
as fishermen

192
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:11,263
at the beginning,

193
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:14,156
and they're having in a big storm

194
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,570
fishing,

195
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,130
and they're they're making their way towards land

196
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,490
and

197
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,345
they've gotta get in because a big storm coming.

198
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:26,825
I really like the little

199
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,185
site gag where he's still rowing

200
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:39,428
as they as they've come when lands on the dock. It it feels like a cold open for the comic is what it does. Right. You know, Huey, Gottfredson

201
00:12:39,428 --> 00:12:47,316
a whole bit with that, hey, but the the y week just popped up when they were there. But having the whole storm and

202
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:49,990
stuff on there feels like something very out of the cartoons

203
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:54,520
of the era. Yeah. And and I think that very much like a cold open.

204
00:12:55,014 --> 00:13:00,258
That's what we're gonna see a lot with this one. Right? Is is that it's gonna be really reminiscent of those cartoons.

205
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,465
It's the classic Barks and stormy night.

206
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,140
Including

207
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,380
the mysterious

208
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,300
stranger

209
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
that shows up.

210
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,967
They hear they hear a loud knocking on the door open the door and at first, they don't see anyone.

211
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:21,550
And then we meet yellow beak. Do you wanna describe yellow beef for us

212
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:23,188
there be the

213
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:24,107
peg

214
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:25,545
paired pirate.

215
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:26,524
Sure.

216
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:28,701
Hot and everything.

217
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:31,831
Just the very

218
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:35,783
archetype of auto pirate are I'm gonna use

219
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,216
nautical terms and throw around pirate jargon

220
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:44,265
Right. Be too excited for adventure. He demands some food

221
00:13:45,163 --> 00:13:45,663
and

222
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,981
they give him slum

223
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:50,710
Had you ever heard of Slum gu?

224
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:52,944
Don't think i have.

225
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:55,595
This is the only place I've heard that term.

226
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:01,663
I guess it's like a a a low class beef stew, like beef pepperoni or something.

227
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:11,061
Donald tries to make it fiery hot. He ends up loving it. And then we kind of fade

228
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:11,899
to

229
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:17,503
realize that he yellow beak is being followed by black pete

230
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,738
and his hen man

231
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:20,976
and

232
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:24,785
Donald ends up hiding him

233
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:27,825
from pete kind of reluctant.

234
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:32,005
Pete goes in and and into their, like,

235
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,357
c s or whatever,

236
00:14:35,134 --> 00:14:38,267
and he tries to get some intel, and it's obvious that,

237
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:40,795
you know, he's pursuing him for some

238
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:42,271
nefarious purposes.

239
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:44,342
And

240
00:14:45,993 --> 00:14:47,808
we end up learning

241
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,100
more about what

242
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,540
yellow b

243
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:52,899
motivation is.

244
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:54,939
Do you wanna mention

245
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,154
what he shares with the nephews use? You remember that well enough?

246
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:01,474
Well, it's just Al, you know, there's treasure

247
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:02,754
that there's...

248
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:10,288
They can the key to the treasure of the match the treasure is in that very room. So... Yeah. Pretty convenient.

249
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:11,763
Very well. Yeah.

250
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:15,194
Doesn't love a good adventure with this treasure involved.

251
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:18,714
Yeah. So he's got the classic treasure map

252
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:19,649
and

253
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:26,201
he tells them about Morgan the the treasure of the ghost of Henry Morgan.

254
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:28,733
And so he

255
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:31,350
convince the nephews to help him out,

256
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:38,019
and they find that clue in that very room as you said and and meanwhile black pete has been

257
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,599
ea dropping and figuring out kind of their next steps.

258
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,034
He learns that they're gonna need to hire a ship

259
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,154
So I I really liked this part. He

260
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:51,354
he races ahead

261
00:15:52,094 --> 00:15:52,594
to

262
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:56,328
disguise his ship which is the black Mariah

263
00:15:57,147 --> 00:15:59,165
as the white lily.

264
00:16:00,783 --> 00:16:01,283
And

265
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,300
the next day,

266
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:08,410
donald and the boys and yellow beak. They go to hire ship

267
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:12,660
and who is ready to rent them a ship, but

268
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:16,705
black pete in disguise as a little lady.

269
00:16:17,264 --> 00:16:17,764
And

270
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,155
he's got a whole cover story

271
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:21,324
about

272
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:26,519
why he... Why she has been left widowed

273
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:27,918
and

274
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,115
she sells a pretty good

275
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:32,445
story and they end up

276
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:34,000
renting the ship

277
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:37,090
and taking black pete into disguise.

278
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,245
You got Al lovely classics.

279
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:43,125
Throw yeah address on. No. Al little the difference.

280
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:44,145
Oh, yes.

281
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:45,865
Incredibly convincing.

282
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:51,838
And I don't know that I'm gonna get two in detail with

283
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:57,964
kind of their see voyage because I think this is kind of the part where

284
00:16:58,345 --> 00:16:58,845
the

285
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,764
the pacing of the comic really

286
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:06,155
kind of changes a lot, and it goes from, like,

287
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:11,782
setting the table and telling the story to just showing the story.

288
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:17,345
Right. You know, we've got some really good, like, visual site gag here.

289
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,419
Of

290
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:33,955
black pete sneaking around trying to figure out... Trying to get a hold of the map and yellow be trying to hide the map and the nephews kind of realizing what's going on. Any of the little

291
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,929
scenes in this that you really liked that you wanted to

292
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:39,250
mention or anything?

293
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,789
I mean, the dining the gun my tag is always fun.

294
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:47,725
But he's, like, oh, got you that then go back and then there's the nephew working and his sleep.

295
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:51,685
Like, these kids are such prank that he mother's sleep blocking,

296
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:58,710
therefore frank so they know it. I like the aspect of it's like a montage. But this one you have the artwork

297
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:01,522
That looks really good. What the pete is

298
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:03,279
backlit,

299
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:10,405
sneaking into the, open up in the door. It's just very subtle but very clear what it is. It's telling a great story.

300
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:23,880
Artistic, it takes the story takes its time It doesn't feel like he's tagging it. He's having fun going into detail showing what's going on. It's not me it's sonic well written, but it's well story board. Yeah.

301
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,580
Feels like.

302
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,180
It doesn't. Yeah.

303
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,080
And and I think it's a lot more spare.

304
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:31,194
Storytelling

305
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:32,232
then

306
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,085
and I'm used to, I think. Oh, sure.

307
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:40,155
I mean, when you tell if this... The this these are not comments that are heavy on dialogue.

308
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,510
You definitely not it's gist

309
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,910
what's going on in the story

310
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:54,125
by reading. It. I mean, if you took out all the word bubbles side of this thing probably still get the gist of story. That's true. I think a lot of kids probably learn to read

311
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:56,605
through these comics back yeah. Absolutely.

312
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,619
But... Yeah. It really goes on. This this segment goes on for pages and pages. And,

313
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,259
you know, finally,

314
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,460
pete is revealed

315
00:19:08,132 --> 00:19:10,710
His his weight comes off and

316
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:13,945
then there's a couple more pages of

317
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:16,591
honestly, a a pretty cool

318
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:28,200
kind of battle fight sequence that has some real danger or, you know, pete is wielding a knife, his hen are wielding a knife and they're really going for the kill. That's one of the things that I like about some of these

319
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:31,876
older depictions of the characters is that they weren't

320
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:36,530
afraid to kind of imply danger and violence. Right. Well, I mean,

321
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:42,812
they're cut. It's not well. They're just bad guys. Not bad district for kids the Bad guess for those.

322
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,998
They're just generally bad guys and, you know, they're bad guys for for reason.

323
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:53,711
And so at some... Eventually, they do catch Donald and you'll be become the nephews.

324
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:58,713
And they hit another of the pirate cliches, they make them walk the plank.

325
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:00,109
But

326
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:04,216
the end up tricking them, the nephews catch them in a makeshift

327
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:05,788
raft

328
00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:06,825
and

329
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:08,981
they're allowed to sail

330
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:13,131
off and then we come to learn that while

331
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:14,344
has...

332
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:17,016
He believes that he's gotten the map.

333
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:20,819
In fact, it's missing a key part

334
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:23,389
and that'll become important later.

335
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,678
They take a route.

336
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:31,278
They take the raft to the island of Henry Morgan.

337
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:41,662
Again, there's another side guy that I think Barks pretty well where Donald wakes up and they've already landed and he yells land to h. I really like that that sequence.

338
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:45,224
Yeah. The next segment of the story is them

339
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:47,101
trying to beat

340
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,177
pete to that treasure.

341
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:50,135
They

342
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:59,411
they are searching for a while. They eventually find the next part of the treasure map, but pete has arrived. They see his ship in the distance.

343
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:10,207
And then they had a plan to sneak back and where the ship so that they can get the rest that now. They do so, they encounter that he has...

344
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:16,927
Has already left ship once they get there. You he left a pretty funny note

345
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:18,802
on his bed that says

346
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:31,795
if he doesn't come back, please oblige and send his remains to my... To my old mother pitt boy. I I love how he writes that out and nice cursive script do to mind my mother

347
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:36,210
and his boy. Just feel how actually talk on. Yeah.

348
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:40,120
And so they go back to the islands

349
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:41,558
and

350
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:43,875
pick up the trail again

351
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:48,557
and they eventually find the cave mentioned in the map

352
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:54,634
and find a chest that's again can very conveniently labeled with Henry Morgan's name.

353
00:21:55,294 --> 00:22:03,014
Do you wanna talk us through what happens when they open in the chest? That's where they find the the ghost pops out who says, hey, here's the map.

354
00:22:03,668 --> 00:22:08,196
Just go take care before we go to disturb. It'll be i thought a resting place and

355
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:13,314
I'm tired of being bothered i'm like, I like being it ghost here in the cave go away. Take my Barks. Lead

356
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:14,514
And

357
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:15,674
once again,

358
00:22:15,974 --> 00:22:18,554
i I love out i'll throw a sheet on,

359
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:34,126
obviously, Have a ghost. Could be anybody else under here. Some of these cliches I have to imagine aren't weren't as beat to death and back then. But you know, hey probably that. It's it's a kid's comic. So it's it's fun. It's it's fun to have that realization. I mean...

360
00:22:35,323 --> 00:22:37,737
Yeah. Kids like to know feel that, like they're

361
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:39,788
more in the know than the characters.

362
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,624
So of course, that ghost is actually

363
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,062
heats and disguise

364
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,140
and

365
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:49,594
They're trying to track down

366
00:22:50,094 --> 00:22:52,554
the... They're trying to let them do the work.

367
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:56,682
Sure. Finding the treasure for them while they stay in the shadow.

368
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,879
There's a.

369
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:01,090
Right. There's a couple of cool segments here.

370
00:23:01,624 --> 00:23:05,764
Where yellow beak reveals that the missing part of the map is actually tattooed

371
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:20,559
right on his torso. And i thought that was cool. And you have to sight through the eye of a skull to find the the final site of the treasure. Right I thought that was really neat too. That's that's a fun that's of fun Scrooge.

372
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:24,056
Yeah. Understand how you need to score mode or something, but okay.

373
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:28,984
And so they dig up the chest, meanwhile, Keeps and his countrymen

374
00:23:29,802 --> 00:23:31,261
are waiting in the background

375
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:38,434
letting them do all the work. Mh. And they finally come out

376
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:41,015
once they've done the loop grunt work.

377
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:44,045
You wanna talk us through that

378
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:46,041
final segment where they're

379
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:48,076
revel by the

380
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:49,074
like.

381
00:23:49,532 --> 00:23:52,002
Happy we got it. You know, Donald

382
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,519
finds the treasure,

383
00:23:53,857 --> 00:23:54,357
which

384
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:59,960
nowadays me understand that if donald find something, you know, that's not the end of the story because it's gonna be

385
00:24:00,498 --> 00:24:03,373
there's resolving not foil and so there they are, and they take it from them.

386
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:08,802
But if you look Al them we have that comic guys, well it's just dog the yellow beak.

387
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,152
Yeah. There's three...

388
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:19,607
That pretty little missing. And all of a sudden, Coconut start falling from this skies. And just as simple as that the nephews

389
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,415
did typical fashion come in and saved the day

390
00:24:23,192 --> 00:24:43,523
by thanking everybody on the head. And I like to the immediate reaction of the Hen man is to celebrate that they only have to split it two ways. Mh i realized them. Like, you they all sudden knocked got the captain and gave them. Yeah. Well ish who is are where the where the really good make came from. Yep. And and, of course, two more coconut joined.

391
00:24:44,102 --> 00:24:45,841
And so they have

392
00:24:46,594 --> 00:24:50,434
they've they've done it. They've gotten the treasury. They've secured it for themselves.

393
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,614
They want a bad guys back in

394
00:24:54,449 --> 00:25:02,949
bound and they start to argue. Donald starts to get up on his high horse about who's responsible for finding the treasure

395
00:25:03,464 --> 00:25:08,435
you know, he accuses yellow beak of bundling the whole thing if not for my nephews,

396
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:09,433
and

397
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:12,746
yellow beef starts to accuse him of a mutiny,

398
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:19,103
And when they go up to the top deck after they're on the ship, there's a fun little site gag of

399
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:25,180
the Nephews have have taken command of the ship and and they're the captain now.

400
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:30,465
I in the captain Yes. And there's a really panel at the end.

401
00:25:31,078 --> 00:25:34,366
That just shows the shit failing on the distance.

402
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:34,862
Well,

403
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:41,849
yeah. That is a really cool panel. But if you look at it, it's kind of a reflection. There's another panel earlier where they get at the islands.

404
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:45,298
This ship out in the bay and it's very

405
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:48,345
similar. Oh, yeah. When they see pizza.

406
00:25:48,683 --> 00:25:55,664
When they see people let me put less... It's go farther away, but it's a very similar shot of using nail and down. The ship is

407
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,456
dark against the sun... The the the sunset,

408
00:25:58,993 --> 00:26:04,056
and it's very picturesque. But... And anyhow just a very, I think, Atmospheric ending.

409
00:26:04,828 --> 00:26:05,865
Rather than, you know,

410
00:26:06,662 --> 00:26:07,760
seeming like it's

411
00:26:08,496 --> 00:26:11,109
concluding things in end of...

412
00:26:11,845 --> 00:26:15,714
Yeah. It's not really closure. At more just an end.

413
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,514
Yeah. So

414
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:21,994
that is the story of Donald Duck finds pirate.

415
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:23,689
And again,

416
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:25,287
you know, this was

417
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:26,166
originally

418
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,044
conceived as an animated

419
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:33,333
film. It was adapted from the story board. And so I think it has a lot of limitations

420
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:35,490
because of that.

421
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:46,931
Sure. I'm I'm gonna wanna talk it. So one of my favorite things about the Barks stories is that I I feel like I learned a lot from them growing up as a kid. We talked in that first episode

422
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,453
about how, you know, you can learn a lot about mythology and history

423
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:58,809
mh and and a lot. And so I wanna take some time in these episodes to talk about kind of some of the educational aspects.

424
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:02,529
But I have to say I don't think there was really too much

425
00:27:03,764 --> 00:27:04,544
to learn

426
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:06,164
about in this one.

427
00:27:06,764 --> 00:27:10,744
You know, Barb didn't write it. He had some pretty cool illustrations

428
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:12,479
But

429
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:14,159
apart from learning the words

430
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:15,439
sku

431
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:23,403
and just some generic nautical terms i didn't really... There wasn't anything that really piqued my interest in in

432
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,935
in any of those areas. How about you?

433
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:32,249
No. Not really. I mean, it's really lane get a whole lot of the sailing,

434
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:33,649
but it doesn't

435
00:27:33,964 --> 00:27:35,944
really get into that. But you know what?

436
00:27:36,964 --> 00:27:45,075
It's fun. I i think he gives him little chance to work on, like, he was just mainly just doing in the art, and this was based off of some of, but somebody else's story.

437
00:27:45,494 --> 00:27:49,009
Right. So I mean, if you look at it from the criteria, just this artwork,

438
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:51,564
It is a very good job.

439
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:56,964
Yeah. And and here's here's the thing about the art too. Because again, this was a collaboration

440
00:27:57,264 --> 00:27:58,364
between him and Hannah

441
00:27:58,719 --> 00:27:59,219
And

442
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:05,119
I I read a lot of background in this from that graphic novel that I mentioned Gladstone published.

443
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,670
Yeah. Their editor at the time had had really cool

444
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:11,823
write ups of some stories.

445
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:14,455
So I'm gonna refer to some of that, but

446
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:17,127
Hannah was apparently responsible

447
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,617
for most of the inside

448
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:26,211
scenes. He did the art for those that took place inside and Barks focused on a lot of

449
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,502
outside natural seas and

450
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:30,621
shit.

451
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,949
Okay. So that's how they kinda divided that up. So let's talk a little bit about

452
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,381
the general consensus of this story,

453
00:28:39,838 --> 00:28:49,325
I'm gonna be referring in these episodes to the ratings on the website index that's i n d u c k s.

454
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:51,598
And that's a fan site where they aggregate

455
00:28:52,813 --> 00:28:55,666
people's thoughts and information for a lot of the

456
00:28:56,418 --> 00:28:58,356
the Disney comic stories.

457
00:28:58,775 --> 00:29:03,150
So this one has a rating of seven point three out of ten

458
00:29:03,703 --> 00:29:09,806
which is good for six hundred and forty first out of over forty thousand stories years.

459
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:15,390
So that be what in the top five percent or so. But

460
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:19,721
relative to most of the Barks stories, it's pretty well.

461
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:22,274
I would say that this

462
00:29:22,614 --> 00:29:25,194
this story is is generally regarded

463
00:29:25,654 --> 00:29:28,314
pretty well, but mostly as a notable

464
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,927
story and a little bit of a curiosity.

465
00:29:31,386 --> 00:29:33,204
I'm sure it has its fans.

466
00:29:33,703 --> 00:29:39,931
But, you know, it... It's it's the first Barks story. So it's gonna be notable for that reason.

467
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:48,691
As far as my personal opinion of this story, you know I didn't talk about my memories of, But I do remember getting this album

468
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:52,721
and being really excited because the cover looks. So

469
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:59,047
it it really grabs me. You know? Right. The parrot and the treasure chest and Donald

470
00:29:59,546 --> 00:30:06,659
and I was I enjoyed it because I enjoyed all of these comics, but I definitely remember a little bit of a sense of let down

471
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:14,514
because it was so different from the other Barks. Stories that I'd read. And I didn't realize that it was his first one

472
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:16,414
until after I'd read it.

473
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:20,700
And it it definitely made a lot more sense at that point.

474
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:24,391
I really... I think I liked the beginning

475
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:32,724
of the story, the best kind of the setup and all the table setting and the the really suspense moment where yellow beak

476
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:37,174
appears and and pete is ea driving. I thought that was

477
00:30:37,673 --> 00:30:39,571
some pretty cool mood.

478
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:41,621
I also

479
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:44,613
really like some of the kind of

480
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:48,897
geography, the little how they set up the island

481
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:56,820
itself and some of the cool landmarks. You know, I didn't talk about the skeleton tree that they had to follow, but I thought that was some really neat part.

482
00:30:57,434 --> 00:30:57,934
Yeah.

483
00:30:58,551 --> 00:31:03,242
And then, you know, the the middle sequence, it kinda runs together a bit because it's

484
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,398
it's got all that

485
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:07,449
action

486
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:17,774
without any dialogue and that's kind of a double edged sword. Right? Because it's really neat to see. But I I find it's easy to really flipped through it

487
00:31:18,234 --> 00:31:19,294
kinda of quickly.

488
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:25,949
None of it really stuck with me. I hadn't I hadn't read this one in many, many years and I

489
00:31:26,888 --> 00:31:28,627
I barely remembered,

490
00:31:28,966 --> 00:31:34,194
you know, I only really remember the beginning. I think that's what the only part that it really stuck out

491
00:31:34,534 --> 00:31:36,632
in my mind, the whole

492
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,430
going in

493
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:45,392
and all that scene. Yeah. Right sense. So I mean, in in general, I I don't think this is a great story,

494
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:46,388
but

495
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:50,471
I I appreciate it a lot. I enjoy it as, you know,

496
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:55,693
showing Carl Barks potential what he would go on to do.

497
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,544
I do like some of the art a lot.

498
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,959
How about you? What was your impression of this room? Well, logged me when I first red it, I was like, wow,

499
00:32:06,852 --> 00:32:09,565
they did the dumb like version of Treasure Island.

500
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:12,676
The whole, you know,

501
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:21,564
old pirate character that comes in. I've got a secret with people are after, you know, kind of a deal, and I need someone to take me out of shit. Oh let's go get some

502
00:32:21,904 --> 00:32:26,724
random kids fan the people involved and you'll find a ship, all of the ship is Scrooge by pirate

503
00:32:27,104 --> 00:32:35,219
who knew. We have to outs smart them and get the treasure, but then they get treasure, but then we get it back. It's like, okay. And again, you're pointing out that

504
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:38,059
call Barks just an art on this.

505
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,274
So I don't know if I mean, distant in my line as a casual fan, like, does that count as a carl

506
00:32:43,774 --> 00:32:44,274
story,

507
00:32:44,654 --> 00:32:53,596
right, air quotes, or is it just his work? Because he didn't write this and his writing especially later on because he's very different with how he does his its.

508
00:32:54,413 --> 00:32:55,831
This feels, the story

509
00:32:56,384 --> 00:32:57,363
deals formula,

510
00:32:58,022 --> 00:32:58,981
but it's still fun.

511
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:07,249
Yellow is a great character. I don't know. Do you... You tell me favorite you'll be Barks in the other form at Disney or Mickey mouse or anything

512
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:11,449
and what got. He he does come back a little bit. We'll

513
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:18,092
go talk a little bit about that. Oh. Okay. That's should year. No. I'm I'm glad you asked about that.

514
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:22,576
Because he seems like a fun character particularly you know, the question of

515
00:33:23,194 --> 00:33:25,409
how do you tattoo a parent

516
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,521
a human my like

517
00:33:29,193 --> 00:33:30,292
that's gonna be interesting.

518
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:39,879
And you know I'm sorry to interrupt you. I I forgot to mention that I I liked yellow, but I also found him in incredibly

519
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:40,839
unsettling.

520
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:42,639
Right? Because

521
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,099
he is a parent,

522
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:46,599
and and he's parent sized

523
00:33:47,913 --> 00:33:56,155
and I didn't really know how to to read him because most of these Ducktales these animal characters are not the normal size

524
00:33:56,548 --> 00:34:02,436
So, like am I supposed to read him as like being a human like character or a parent like?

525
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:08,791
Like, at first, I thought he was just a the pirates talking here. Right. Okay. Yeah. And

526
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:10,801
and by the acts like,

527
00:34:11,598 --> 00:34:16,901
just the regular quote, human character like all of them do. So I found him existential

528
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:19,696
pretty weird. And and i'm

529
00:34:20,034 --> 00:34:24,141
from the moment nick. Crew remember the restaurant captain shoulder, but it's still a crew member.

530
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:30,248
Right the the the captain's terrace, it happens to be a very essential carrier that is

531
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:35,270
there... I'm that's that's i'm Didn't think about that because with he's, you know,

532
00:34:36,427 --> 00:34:37,326
we think of

533
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:38,562
characters

534
00:34:39,314 --> 00:34:42,750
you don't usually think about them as being Ducktales.

535
00:34:43,229 --> 00:34:47,264
This story made me think about him and that that definitely brought out of it.

536
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:55,911
That that makes sense. I think sometimes he read to much Al released and very some comics, but... Yeah. No. I think but now So

537
00:34:56,464 --> 00:35:01,244
you know, this one is always gonna be a little bit different just because of the nature of the story.

538
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:10,733
Definitely a notable one. Some some reflections, I'd like to take some time in in these episodes to talk about

539
00:35:11,352 --> 00:35:26,473
how well the story holds up if there's any thing archaic or dated. And, you know, this one because it's so episodic. I I don't feel like it it it almost feels like it could be of of almost any time. You know? I mean, there's not a lot of, like, modern

540
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:36,500
indicators or anything that pulled me out. The way some stories do. But I think that might be more in effect just how spa

541
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:44,109
I mean, I would think nowadays if they're doing it, I think it would be easier to have Pete being old man.

542
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:45,109
Sure

543
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:51,587
and that kind of a thing making him a woman. Yeah gone a little bit. That definitely a little bit out of style.

544
00:35:52,522 --> 00:35:54,709
But again, that was just par for the course

545
00:35:55,248 --> 00:35:58,621
but I don't think there's anything that really needs to be kind of

546
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:03,509
explained. Oh, I was just that was just, you know, part of the time.

547
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:06,814
Yeah. I needed to disguise. It's fine.

548
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,567
And then had asked

549
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:10,918
about other appearances

550
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:18,834
So I wanna talk at this point the episode about appearances in other media. I'll jump a little bit. To okay.

551
00:36:19,412 --> 00:36:20,471
Other appearances

552
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:28,224
for yellow beak. So so the weird thing that they did is they recycled this story a lot in Disney commerce.

553
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:32,935
Oh really. No. Like this wants to? Like, they would basically

554
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:38,941
reprint this, but with different characters following this sketch, like, they used the

555
00:36:39,558 --> 00:36:45,282
Peter pan characters. I think Captain Hook basically played the black pete role in one of the

556
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,838
later four colors

557
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:54,650
I think there might have been some book adaptations of it or something. But I thought it I found it to be very

558
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,943
weird that they kept going back to this

559
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,391
very cliche, like, bare bones story.

560
00:37:02,468 --> 00:37:06,970
That's true. Yeah. Have the one had some kind of popularity that we were aware of

561
00:37:07,428 --> 00:37:12,831
Yeah. Or it is this a story that disney own. It didn't have to pay for another writer to do.

562
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:15,321
Yeah. That might be the case.

563
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:19,783
There was a sequel to this that was published.

564
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:24,208
Barks didn't do it. But I don't remember. I don't think it was a very notable.

565
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,100
Story, but they they did bring him back

566
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,380
for a follow ups story at some point

567
00:37:33,174 --> 00:37:34,074
And then

568
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:41,240
I have not seen this personally yet. You know, we... We're gonna talk at this point about if there's

569
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,360
ever been an appearance or a reference to the Ducktales,

570
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:50,214
which, you know, is it can be a little bit divisive among our fans. Some of them really appreciate

571
00:37:50,912 --> 00:37:53,170
those. Some don't, but

572
00:37:54,588 --> 00:37:55,368
he never

573
00:37:55,707 --> 00:38:02,096
appeared in the first series, but apparently, he has a pretty notable appearance in the third season.

574
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:17,900
Right. And I not seen the thirties yet. I'm waiting for to finish I can stream the whole thing. Right. I've only seen it on that what what they have on Disney plus myself. So that'll be an episode to look forward to its called the first adventure.

575
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,060
Do you mind if I

576
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,675
spoil what maybe go four of it? So

577
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:26,315
apparently, he appears as a re

578
00:38:26,815 --> 00:38:28,475
skeleton of himself.

579
00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:31,335
And he is the villain.

580
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:41,405
And and it sounds like it's a reference to, you know, Barks for a story calling that up. So the first adventure.

581
00:38:41,745 --> 00:38:42,445
And the

582
00:38:43,065 --> 00:38:49,538
people may not like them or Barks, may not appreciate or have their own opinions on them, but from what I've seen in cartoons,

583
00:38:50,196 --> 00:38:52,534
the guys who behind it are fans of

584
00:38:52,873 --> 00:39:02,225
not just the original death, but the original Barks cartoons curtail of a lot of the references back or back and what background or they have in there. Yeah. And it may devices, but

585
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:10,730
you know what if you're family trying to get it in there. I think that's good effort you can't... It's hard to things everybody all the time, but... Oh, i definitely there.

586
00:39:11,345 --> 00:39:13,885
Agree. I agree. I appreciate the Barks references.

587
00:39:14,305 --> 00:39:18,325
I sometimes feel a little bit weird about where they go with them, but

588
00:39:18,665 --> 00:39:21,377
you know, I I enjoy it as it's own thing.

589
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:23,973
The the other media

590
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:25,491
is the

591
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:37,726
parks does a lot of oil paintings. We had talked about this. I mentioned this in the previous episode. So if there's a corresponding oil painting, I'm not gonna go to in dev because this is a podcast

592
00:39:38,424 --> 00:39:39,523
and it is

593
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:41,001
not a visual media.

594
00:39:41,914 --> 00:39:47,888
There is oil painting titled return to Morgan's island that I think is really cool.

595
00:39:48,547 --> 00:39:55,828
I'm hoping to get a Facebook page up for these So so I'll i'll post a visual for that. But but look up that one,

596
00:39:56,706 --> 00:40:01,771
I think it's a really neat one It shows that cool skeleton tree. In the round of it.

597
00:40:02,508 --> 00:40:08,116
I also took a look for this episode out at the going rate for the original

598
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:10,524
print of four color number nine

599
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:17,703
just for reference right now, the the lowest ebay listing I saw was six hundred and ninety nine dollars.

600
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:19,034
And

601
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:22,742
up to twenty six hundred dollars.

602
00:40:23,877 --> 00:40:24,377
Hopefully

603
00:40:24,914 --> 00:40:25,893
depending on

604
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,568
on the condition.

605
00:40:30,035 --> 00:40:37,134
Let's see. Like, the die hard collector you pay for that. That's for sure. Oh, yeah. Well, this is definitely an an important piece of,

606
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:45,925
you know, Barks history Barks memorabilia. Look at the pricing of these, but like there's a lot. Well, when you think of the history of them and actually how old mean that's.

607
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:49,159
That's a nineteen forty two.

608
00:40:49,499 --> 00:40:52,579
That's a what a... Yeah year old almost maybe old comic,

609
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:58,550
maybe yeah. It would be worth that much. Those are that expensive It's so rare. Definitely golden age.

610
00:40:59,669 --> 00:41:03,365
So I'm trying to think I I think I covered everything that I

611
00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:07,688
looks to talk about. I'm not trying to be exhaustive, but,

612
00:41:08,504 --> 00:41:13,244
you know, any any closing thoughts that you got about Donald Duck i'm hierarchical

613
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:18,285
I mean, I I've mentioned before and I don't wanna I can I don't wanna be the the head.

614
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:19,444
The

615
00:41:19,825 --> 00:41:21,579
art in this is

616
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:22,618
tremendous.

617
00:41:23,993 --> 00:41:29,041
Even just that the minor characters, that it it's all well done, The facial reactions

618
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:33,729
but it's the big scenes that are obviously Karl marx, the codes

619
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:35,486
and some of the silhouette,

620
00:41:35,865 --> 00:41:38,579
it's just tremendously done

621
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:40,099
for that era

622
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,420
for the detail and the expressions

623
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,660
and

624
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:51,776
if you look at some of these shots, I know I'm looking at one where the boat is coming over a wave.

625
00:41:52,392 --> 00:41:57,179
The the water's moving, there's moving in the water it's coming up this the the sales are full

626
00:41:57,479 --> 00:42:03,314
and you see a pot of dolphins out ahead of the boat as the sunset said goes behind it, and these pink

627
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:07,724
the pink sunset with the yellow sky, and I look at that, and I'm like, yes.

628
00:42:08,363 --> 00:42:11,976
Obviously he's going to the oil painting slate on Al life because that is

629
00:42:12,527 --> 00:42:13,785
just not a beautiful

630
00:42:14,161 --> 00:42:14,440
scene.

631
00:42:15,038 --> 00:42:18,766
And he has several of those with the of the parish particularly

632
00:42:19,182 --> 00:42:19,881
and thinking

633
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:29,134
Barks really like pirate boats. I that. I mean this kinda seems he must have enjoyed this and had some real fun. You don't often get

634
00:42:29,887 --> 00:42:49,724
just beautiful art in a comic book. Nowadays. This this his comment has goes all over the place It's kind of experimental like you that. I think that's really cool you pointed out about the facial expressions. There's some pretty pretty great facial expressions in here. I I kinda got hung up on the lack of detail in some of the backgrounds.

635
00:42:50,223 --> 00:43:01,464
Mh. But that's fair. But I do think you're right. There's some really cool artwork. And you know, Barks famously loved to refer reference old issues of national geographic...

636
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:12,593
And I know he did that with some of the nautical stuff for this. Awesome. Well, Eric, thank you so much for joining me for this. I really Pleasure

637
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,906
I'm I'm excited to to keep going.
