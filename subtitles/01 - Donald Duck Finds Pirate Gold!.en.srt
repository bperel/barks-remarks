00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:10,544
greetings, Carl Barks fans,

2
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:14,945
You are about to listen to the very first episode of Barks remarks.

3
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:33,805
If you are new to the podcast, you should know that this first episode is pretty rough. And I have learned a lot about audio quality and sound editing since recording this one. And also the form of the show has evolved quite a bit. As I've figured out what really works in these episodes

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:59,440
So if you want to start at the beginning, that's great. Welcome aboard. But if you're if you're listening to get a taste for what the podcast is like, I really suggest starting with a slightly later episode. Maybe choose one of your personal favorite stories that we were recorded. The audio quality on this one is pretty rough and there's some background noise. Both of which are issues that I've pretty much addressed in future episodes.

5
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:04,595
That said, thank you very much for giving a podcast to try and hope you stick with us

6
00:01:21,635 --> 00:01:22,135
have

7
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:53,245

19
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:28,635
Hi. Mike experience Barks.

20
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:35,456
Well, I was familiar with Inducks stories for Al long time, Barks, houston to the Crow Barks aspect of,

21
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:41,992
but having gone read through them, and what be show because there's some of the story lines

22
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:43,311
from those

23
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:46,986
and and the arts, and I've just been really appreciative

24
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:50,157
the history and the work that you put into

25
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:51,355
creating

26
00:02:51,894 --> 00:02:52,394
the

27
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:53,992
universe

28
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:55,230
which particularly

29
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:57,605
who is one of my all time favorite

30
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:58,965
just characters,

31
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:00,885
Whether it's comics cartoons,

32
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:03,084
all around just fun

33
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:03,965
nuance

34
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:04,984
characters.

35
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,058
Right on.

36
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:06,936
And

37
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:10,605
today, we are going to be talking

38
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:15,884
about Carl Barks very first long form adventure story

39
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:19,564
called Donald Duck finds pirate gold.

40
00:03:19,944 --> 00:03:24,744
I probably didn't say the exclamation point there, but there is an exclamation point in the title.

41
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:27,733
Eric, had you read this one

42
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,770
before

43
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:31,181
we planned the podcast?

44
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,117
I don't think I did,

45
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:42,484
but I was familiar with So I I don't know. Maybe I had back in the day and read it somewhere. I don't know do you have a copy or if I saw it on a reprint? Because I know

46
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:44,657
Disney on occasion

47
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:46,794
for free home day,

48
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:49,052
the first Saturday they May

49
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,776
would always issue some old comics and rei small comments I have some. That are rei.

50
00:03:55,394 --> 00:03:59,545
Of some of the classic disney, comments stories from Barks and them from back and yesterday.

51
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:06,879
I don't know if I had this one or would, but I was reading it it all... Felt really really like, I like I know the other. I've seen him before.

52
00:04:07,574 --> 00:04:16,177
Yeah. Now that you mentioned that this one might have been one of the free common day ones. But, yeah, Let's let's dive in to a background.

53
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:20,549
On that and this story was originally

54
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:23,429
published in October of nineteen

55
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:24,989
forty two.

56
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:26,443
In

57
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:33,738
the old comic series four color, this was four color number nine. This was before

58
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:38,884
they started publishing under the imprint of, like, well Disney comics and stories,

59
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,983
And so, Eric, I've

60
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:42,541
decided to

61
00:04:43,694 --> 00:04:47,424
have a little bit of context for what was going on at the time.

62
00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:51,372
I mean, historical context or like.

63
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,017
That's right alright. So

64
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:58,211
nineteen forty two, I mean, thing is...

65
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:02,780
Me think I don't think eight is going on a little bit. It's pretty calm peaceful times.

66
00:05:03,514 --> 00:05:11,925
Yeah. We... Well, we know we're we're in the height of World War two around this time. So it's an interesting time to be enjoying a funny comic

67
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,819
story

68
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:16,785
okay funny the animal story, but people needed entertainment.

69
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:18,123
Of course.

70
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,120
So

71
00:05:19,537 --> 00:05:21,154
I looked at a couple

72
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:22,644
of be

73
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,198
other events.

74
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,376
Something that I thought was interesting, this is when the little golden books

75
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:30,707
started to publish.

76
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:39,974
A little golden but. Yes. So, who hasn't read the Hook puppy. Yeah. Well, was I I was a big fan of Tony Sc line. That

77
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:41,653
i that's good.

78
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:45,528
So I... Anyway, that's feels very, like, appropriate.

79
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:50,017
Sure, you know, goes along with the funny animal books.

80
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:51,572
Other

81
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,563
notable things in real world,

82
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:01,832
this was during the time when Roosevelt had just in... Implemented a big wage and rent freeze.

83
00:06:02,568 --> 00:06:05,817
It was the debut of the Mighty mouse Cartoon.

84
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:07,549
Not really.

85
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:13,589
And then white Christmas was topping the charts at this time. So

86
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:15,324
a little more background.

87
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:17,524
This is a very long

88
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:18,764
comic

89
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:21,184
compared to most of the bark stories.

90
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:24,729
It clocks in at sixty four pages

91
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:27,657
like most ways it's been reprinted.

92
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:29,331
Quite a few times.

93
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:33,899
I read this one as part of the Gladstone

94
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:37,135
reprint, and they they did a giant album of it.

95
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:38,609
That was

96
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:40,226
a pretty neat release.

97
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:44,522
You know, this one draws a lot of attention just because

98
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:45,840
it is

99
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:50,928
you know, this is our first step. So so this is the first of the

100
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:53,899
long adventure stories but

101
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:59,601
one of the misconceptions about it, it is not carl Barks very first comment

102
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:02,193
mh. But she might hear people

103
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:06,716
share as a fact. He actually had one other before that called

104
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:13,595
Pluto saves the ship. I've never read it. So Okay. But this was his first dot.

105
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:19,343
What was this the... Was this the first jump comment? Like, I i

106
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:20,621
his first

107
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:22,833
was it he first

108
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:23,731
Ducktales?

109
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:32,396
So I know that they did like... There was... There were newspaper comments strips before this, and I don't think they were

110
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:37,610
collected or anything beforehand. So I don't know the answer to that.

111
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:42,429
So the... This had a a bit of an unusual background

112
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:43,783
and source

113
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,349
compared to most Barks po.

114
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,149
This is actually

115
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:50,589
based on an

116
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:51,509
animated

117
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:53,444
story board for

118
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:54,604
a Disney

119
00:07:55,504 --> 00:07:56,004
feature

120
00:07:56,464 --> 00:07:57,524
that was

121
00:07:58,064 --> 00:07:58,564
abandoned

122
00:07:58,904 --> 00:07:59,544
based up.

123
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:00,437
Yeah.

124
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:07,060
At one point, Disney was going to do a feature that was gonna be called Morgan's ghost.

125
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:08,112
K.

126
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:09,728
And

127
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:19,177
they abandoned it, and at some point, they were kind of honeywell around for story ideas to include in their comme line.

128
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:20,436
And

129
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:25,650
Carl Barks was brought on because he he was working in the animation department.

130
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:27,044
At the time.

131
00:08:27,504 --> 00:08:28,004
So

132
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:29,404
they

133
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:31,204
passed him

134
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,044
along

135
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:32,964
with

136
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:34,704
Ga hannah.

137
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,179
Is the other artist who worked on this

138
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,539
to

139
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,260
adapt this story. And

140
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,915
have in the part. So,

141
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:47,874
yeah. This one definitely had

142
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:48,795
a

143
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:50,074
more unusual

144
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:55,439
background than most but it was well received enough that Mh

145
00:08:56,215 --> 00:08:56,715
publisher

146
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:04,970
would end up coming back to Barks and ask asking him to return to the well for for more stories.

147
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:07,547
And this, you know, is what became

148
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:13,839
the beginning of his his legendary career, really doing mostly these Ducktales com.

149
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:16,774
Okay. Right yeah. So

150
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:25,805
as we go into these, I'm kind of working out the structure of the podcast a little bit, but I'm thinking we'll mention if there are any notable appearances.

151
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,555
Before we actually dive into the substance of the story,

152
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:31,734
So

153
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:33,932
apart from the nephews

154
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:35,490
and Donald,

155
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,701
the the most

156
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,551
notable character and this is gotta be yellow. Right?

157
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:44,326
I'm thinking

158
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:46,459
no it's p, obviously.

159
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:51,439
The villain the the classic Disney belt who shows up and everything thing.

160
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,028
Yeah. It isn't it weird to see pee in

161
00:09:55,446 --> 00:10:08,180
in a Ducktales story. It it really is that he's like well, I think, obviously, this this his first time out, it would think he's gonna go through the well of, okay. Sure where the balance that we have that is the

162
00:10:08,694 --> 00:10:12,250
comic first and, you know, at this point pretty much just paid.

163
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,286
Alright. And Huey, universal so they like, you know once transfer over.

164
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:17,825
Even his

165
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:18,878
his

166
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:22,407
Huey,, you gotta think later on just be big boys.

167
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,040
Where if you think about it,

168
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:29,634
realize, I think he's supposed to be a cat, but we can look at the

169
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:33,874
type of what he is how he's drawn

170
00:10:34,388 --> 00:10:39,513
He kinda see how the big boys are living bit her model off of him. The big bur

171
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,595
are hoping kind of a character who's should,

172
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:45,115
but not always

173
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:46,035
the

174
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,954
intellectual rival, if you will

175
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:49,834
bureau

176
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,690
story,

177
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,890
but I always.

178
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,250
I enough?

179
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,529
I'm a huge

180
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,730
and personally.

181
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,410
Do you know my favorite trivia about

182
00:10:59,029 --> 00:10:59,585
about pete

183
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:06,655
No. What's your favorite attribute about? He actually pre dates mickey mouse.

184
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:13,782
They were... They they used Him a little bit before Mickey was introduced and some very early cartoon. So

185
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:15,514
key goes way back,

186
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:20,074
formerly peg leg p, but, yes. Black pete is one of the big characters

187
00:11:20,855 --> 00:11:29,300
in this one. And then you mentioned is Hen. Do they only name one of them as Red Eye, I think. Oh, I don't even know. I can't remember. I just... Yeah.

188
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:31,055
The generic

189
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:37,055
mouse type billing guys that seem like they're an archetype of...

190
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:38,995
Hang on. More,

191
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:40,388
more yeah.

192
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:45,038
Yeah. They look a lot like I I think they had to have been model after more.

193
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:47,494
So anyway, that's that's

194
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,011
some of the backgrounds

195
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:51,143
about this story.

196
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:56,875
Are you ready to dive into the a plot of the stories such as it is?

197
00:11:57,648 --> 00:11:58,786
Sure. Excellent.

198
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:00,222
So

199
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:02,256
lot. But

200
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:05,462
Donald Doc finds higher gold

201
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:08,533
has donald and the Nephews cast

202
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,049
as fishermen

203
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:11,343
at the beginning,

204
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,116
and they're out in a big storm

205
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,570
fishing

206
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,010
and they're they're making their way towards land,

207
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,570
and

208
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,305
they've gotta get in because a big storm coming.

209
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:29,125
I really like the little site gag where he's still rolling.

210
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:44,646
As a... As they've come when land on the dock. It it feels like a cold open for the covid is what it does. Right. You know, should done a whole bit with that, hey, the the you'll good your leak just popped up when they were there.

211
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:47,316
By having the whole storm and

212
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:49,950
stuck on there feels like something very out of the cartoons

213
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:54,440
of the era. Yeah. And and I think that's very much like a cold open.

214
00:12:55,014 --> 00:13:00,356
That's what we're gonna see a lot with this one. Right? Is is that it's gonna be really remnants reminiscent of those cartoons ins.

215
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,385
It's the classic that dark and stormy night.

216
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,060
Including

217
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,380
the mysterious

218
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,220
stranger

219
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,220
that shows up

220
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,007
They hear... They hear Al loud knocking on the door they open the door, and at first, they don't see anyone,

221
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:21,550
and then we meet yellow b. Do you wanna describe yellow for us

222
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:23,188
that be the

223
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:25,505
peg lake harry pirate

224
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:26,504
medicare.

225
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:28,701
We and everything.

226
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:31,791
Just the very

227
00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:35,743
archetype of auto part are i'm gonna use

228
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,115
not Al term some throw around pirate jargon,

229
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:44,185
right? You're too excited for adventure. He demands some food

230
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:45,703
and

231
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:48,300
they give him slim going.

232
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:50,471
Had you ever heard of S?

233
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:52,864
Don't think I have

234
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:55,555
This is the only place I've heard that term.

235
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:01,603
I guess it's like a a a low class beef stew, like, pepperoni or something.

236
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:11,740
Donald tries to make it fiery hot. He ends up loving it. And then we kind of fade to

237
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:13,630
realize that he

238
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:17,423
yellow is being followed by black pete

239
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:19,259
and his hen.

240
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:21,495
And well

241
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:24,705
Donald ends up hiding him

242
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:27,825
from pete kind of reluctant.

243
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:31,925
Pete goes in and and into there, like,

244
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,237
see s or whatever.

245
00:14:35,134 --> 00:14:38,267
And he tries to get some intel, and it's obvious that,

246
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,795
you know, he's pursuing him for some

247
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:42,271
nefarious purposes,

248
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:44,262
and

249
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:47,768
we end up learning

250
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,059
more about what

251
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:50,980
yellow

252
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:52,759
motivation is.

253
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:54,899
Do you wanna mention

254
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,154
what he shares with the nephews? Do you remember that well enough?

255
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:03,154
Well, Just that, you know, there's treasure and and that there's a...

256
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:10,248
They can the key to the treasure of the map the treasure is in that very room. So yeah. Pretty convenient,

257
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:11,723
you're well yeah.

258
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:15,154
Doesn't love a good adventure with this she involved.

259
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:18,674
Yeah. So he's got the classic treasure map,

260
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:19,634
and

261
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:26,161
He tells them about Morgan, the the treasurer of the ghost of Henry Morgan.

262
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:28,613
And so he

263
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:31,410
convince the nephews to help him out

264
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:37,939
and they find that clue in that very room as you said. And and meanwhile black pee has been

265
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,599
ea dropping and figuring out kind of their next steps.

266
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:46,034
He learns that they're gonna need to hire a ship

267
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:49,114
So I I really like this part. He...

268
00:15:49,894 --> 00:15:51,354
He races ahead

269
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:52,434
to

270
00:15:53,294 --> 00:15:56,248
disguise his ship which is the black Mara mariah

271
00:15:57,147 --> 00:15:59,125
as the white lily.

272
00:16:00,783 --> 00:16:01,283
And

273
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,340
the next day,

274
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:08,109
Donald and boys and Yellow beak. They go to higher ship.

275
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:12,660
And who is ready to rent them a ship, but

276
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:16,785
black pete and Disguise as a little old lady.

277
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:17,803
And

278
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,155
he's got a whole cover story

279
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,271
about

280
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:26,559
why he why she has been left widowed

281
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:27,958
and

282
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:32,405
she sells a pretty good socks story, and they end up

283
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,000
renting the ship

284
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:37,090
and taking black pete and the sky.

285
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,145
You gotta Al lovely bit classic.

286
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:43,024
True address on. No. Of difference.

287
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:44,024
Oh, yes.

288
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:45,865
Incredibly convincing.

289
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:51,838
And I don't know that I'm gonna get two in detail with

290
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:57,964
kind of their sea voyage because I think this is kind of the part where

291
00:16:58,345 --> 00:16:58,845
the

292
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,725
the pacing of the common really

293
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,535
kind of changes a lot, and it goes from, like

294
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:11,782
setting the table and telling the story to just showing the story.

295
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:17,367
Right. You know, we've got some really good, like visual site gag here

296
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:18,458
of

297
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:24,872
black p sneaking around trying to figure out trying to get a hold of the map

298
00:17:25,264 --> 00:17:33,955
and yellow be trying to hide the map and the nephews kind of realizing what's going on. Any of the little

299
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,929
scenes in this that you really liked that you wanted to

300
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,250
mention or anything?

301
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,789
I mean, the dining the gun white tag is always fun.

302
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:46,465
Right He's like, oh, tell you that then goes back and then there's the nephew

303
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:51,645
working Inducks sleep. Like, these kids are such prank that even want to be blocking.

304
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:58,710
They're frank so they know it. I like the aspect of. It's like a montage, But this one, you have the artwork

305
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:01,522
That looks really good. What the peak is

306
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:03,259
backlit.

307
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:10,225
Sneaking into the opening amp for the door. It's just very subtle but very clear what it is. It's having a great story.

308
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:17,332
Artistic. It takes... The store takes its time It doesn't feel like he's padding it. He's having fun

309
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:25,540
going into detail showing what's going on. It's not me it's not like, well written, but it's well story board. Yeah. And feels like.

310
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,720
Doesn't. Yeah.

311
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,080
And and I think it's a lot more spare.

312
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:31,194
Storytelling

313
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:32,192
then

314
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,125
that I'm used to, I think. Oh, sure.

315
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:40,075
I mean, when you tell that this the this these are not heavy on dialog.

316
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:42,510
Basically that is gist

317
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,910
what's going on in the story

318
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:54,085
by reading. I mean, if you took about all the word bubbles out of this thing, probably still get the gist a story. It's true. I think a lot of kids probably learn to read

319
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,585
through these comments Back... Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

320
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,619
But yeah. It really goes on. This this segment goes on for pages and pages. And,

321
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,179
you know, finally,

322
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,419
pete is revealed

323
00:19:08,132 --> 00:19:10,670
his his weight comes off and

324
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:13,945
then there's a couple more pages of

325
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:16,591
honestly a a pretty cool

326
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:28,200
kind of battle fight sequence that has some real danger, you know, pete is wielding a knife, his hen are willing a knife and they're really going for the kill. That's one of the things that I like about some of these

327
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:31,876
Al depictions of the characters is that they weren't

328
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:36,490
afraid to kind of imply danger violence. Right. But I mean,

329
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:47,817
they're cut. Not well. They're they're just bad guys bad days for kids and up I guess for those just. They're just generally bad guys and, you know, their Barks guys work for a reason.

330
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:53,711
And so at some... Eventually, they do catch donald and you'll be in the nephews.

331
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:58,633
And they hit another of the pirate cli cliches, they make them walk the plank.

332
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:00,069
But

333
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:02,422
the band up tricking, them, the

334
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,389
cashed them in a make shift

335
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:05,628
ralph,

336
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:06,905
and

337
00:20:07,283 --> 00:20:08,941
they're allowed to sail

338
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:14,264
off and then we come to learn that while p has...

339
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:16,795
He believes that he's gotten the map.

340
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:20,819
In fact, it's missing a key part

341
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:23,429
and that would become important later.

342
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,559
They take a wrap.

343
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:31,278
They take the draft to the island of Henry Morgan.

344
00:20:32,134 --> 00:20:41,622
Again, there's another side guy that I think works pretty well where donald wakes up and they've already landed and he else land a h. I really like that. That sequence.

345
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:45,211
Yeah. The next segment of the story is them

346
00:20:45,564 --> 00:20:47,022
trying to beat

347
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,077
pete to that treasure.

348
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:50,096
They

349
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:59,411
they are searching for a while. They eventually find the next part of the treasure map, but Pete has arrived. They see his ship in the distance.

350
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:10,127
And then they had Al plan to sneak back and where the ship so that they can get the rest that now, they do so, they encounter that he has

351
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:16,887
has already left the ship once they get there you he left a pretty funny note

352
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:18,802
on his bed that says,

353
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:31,795
if he doesn't come back, please oblige and send his remains to my to my old mother and pitt blake. I I love how he writes that out in nice cursive script. My my mother

354
00:21:32,214 --> 00:21:36,090
and it's boy. I'm just how actually Barks on. Yeah.

355
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:40,040
And so they go back to the islands

356
00:21:40,978 --> 00:21:41,478
and

357
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:43,615
pick up the trail again.

358
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:48,517
And they eventually find the cave mentioned in the map

359
00:21:49,094 --> 00:21:54,594
and find a chest that's, again, very conveniently labeled with Henry Morgan's name.

360
00:21:55,334 --> 00:22:03,054
You wanna talk us through what happens when they open the chest? That's when they find the ghost pops out he says, hey, here's the map.

361
00:22:03,668 --> 00:22:08,196
Just go take care before we don't disturb. It'll be... I thought a resting place and

362
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:13,314
I'm tired of being bothered. I'm, like, I like day it goes here Inducks cave go away. Take my Barks. Leave

363
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:14,514
And

364
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:15,414
once again,

365
00:22:15,974 --> 00:22:18,514
i I love how i'll a on

366
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:19,934
obviously have a ghost,

367
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:34,126
could be anybody else under here. Some of these cliches I have to imagine aren't weren't as beat to death and back then. But you know, April probably that it's it's a kid's topic. So it's it's fun it's it's fun to have that realization. I mean,

368
00:22:35,283 --> 00:22:37,697
yeah. Kids like to know feel that, like they're

369
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:39,748
more in the o than the characters.

370
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,585
So, of course, that ghost is actually

371
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,942
pete and disguise

372
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,220
and

373
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:49,514
They're trying to track down

374
00:22:50,054 --> 00:22:52,374
the... They're trying to let them do the work.

375
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:56,541
Sure finding the treasure for them while they stay in the shadow.

376
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,919
There's a.

377
00:22:58,736 --> 00:23:01,090
Right. There's a couple of cool segments here.

378
00:23:01,624 --> 00:23:05,724
Where yellow reveals that the missing part of the map is actually tattoo

379
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:19,940
right on his torso. I thought that was cool. And then they have to site through the eye of a skull to find the the final sight of the treasure. I I thought that was really neat to. That's kind that the fun. That's the fun trope.

380
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:24,016
Yeah. Understand how you need Al score or something. But okay

381
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:28,984
And so they dig got the chest meanwhile Pete and his abdomen

382
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:31,261
are waiting in the background

383
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:35,195
letting them do all the work.

384
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:38,395
And they finally come out

385
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:41,054
once they've done the the grunt work.

386
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:46,001
You wanna talk us through that final segment where they're

387
00:23:46,578 --> 00:23:51,962
rather. If i get to go like game. Have we got it. You know, donald

388
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,519
finds the treasure

389
00:23:53,897 --> 00:23:54,397
which

390
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:59,946
nowadays can understand that if doesn't find something, you know that's not of the story because it's gonna be

391
00:24:00,658 --> 00:24:03,333
resolve have foil, and so there they are and they take it from them.

392
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:08,762
But if you looking at that we have like how guys, well it's just donald and yellow.

393
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,033
Yeah. There's three...

394
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:13,585
That pretty little.

395
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,815
And all of a sudden, coconut start falling from the guys.

396
00:24:17,193 --> 00:24:19,567
And just simple that the net

397
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,415
a typical batch come in and saves the day

398
00:24:23,192 --> 00:24:31,488
by bunk everybody on the head. And I like the the immediate reaction of the hen is to celebrate that they only have to split it two ways.

399
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:33,165
You realized.

400
00:24:33,582 --> 00:24:34,801
Like you they also

401
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:43,483
not got the captain and gave them Yeah. Rich is over where the where doesn't it came from? Yep. And and, of course, two more coconut joined.

402
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,800
And so they have

403
00:24:46,594 --> 00:24:50,354
They've they've done it. They've gotten the treasure. They've secured it for themselves.

404
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,654
They want the bad guys back in

405
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:54,869
bound

406
00:24:55,209 --> 00:25:02,869
and they start to argue Donald starts to get up on his high horse about who's responsible for finding the treasure

407
00:25:03,464 --> 00:25:08,395
you know, he accuses yellow of bundling the whole thing, if not for my nephews,

408
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:09,433
and

409
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:12,706
Yellow beef starts to accuse him of a mutiny

410
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:19,103
And when they go up to the top deck after they're on the ship, there's a fun little site gag of

411
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,999
the nephews have have taken the command of the ship and and they're the captain now.

412
00:25:25,717 --> 00:25:30,465
I and they captain the yes. And there's a really panel at the end.

413
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,326
That just shows the ship failing on the distance.

414
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:34,862
Well...

415
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:41,810
Yeah. That is a really power. But if you look at it, it's kind of a reflection. There's another panel earlier when they get at the island.

416
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:45,258
They ship out in the bay, and it's very

417
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:48,244
similar. Oh, yeah. When they see pee.

418
00:25:48,683 --> 00:25:55,470
When they see me put less... It's still farther away, but it's a very similar shot of using money down service.

419
00:25:56,043 --> 00:25:58,417
Dark against the sun... The the the sunset

420
00:25:58,993 --> 00:26:01,088
and it's very picture picturesque. But

421
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:04,077
just a very, I think, Al atmospheric ending

422
00:26:04,788 --> 00:26:05,865
rather than, you know,

423
00:26:06,622 --> 00:26:07,760
seeming like it's

424
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:11,070
concluding things in kind of...

425
00:26:11,845 --> 00:26:13,581
Yeah. It's not really closure

426
00:26:14,014 --> 00:26:15,674
more just an end.

427
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,474
Yeah. So

428
00:26:17,854 --> 00:26:21,954
that is the story of donald duck finds pirate.

429
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:23,648
And again,

430
00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:25,327
you know, this was

431
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:26,166
originally

432
00:26:26,505 --> 00:26:28,044
conceived as an animated

433
00:26:28,423 --> 00:26:33,333
film. It was adapted from the story board, and so I think it has a lot of limitations

434
00:26:33,832 --> 00:26:35,410
because of that.

435
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:46,931
Sure. I'm I'm gonna wanna talk So one of my favorite things about the Barks stories is that I I feel like I learned a lot from them growing up as a kid. We talked to that first step episode

436
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:58,809
about how, you know, you can learn a lot about mythology and history. Mh. And and a lot. And so I wanna take some time in these episodes to talk about kind of some of the educational aspects.

437
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:02,489
But I have to say I don't think that was really too much

438
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:04,464
to learn

439
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:05,964
about in this one.

440
00:27:06,764 --> 00:27:09,944
You know, Barb didn't write it. He had some pretty cool

441
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:10,744
illustrations.

442
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:12,479
But

443
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:15,399
apart from learning the words stun come

444
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:23,403
and just some generic nautical terms I didn't really... There wasn't anything that really piqued my interest in in

445
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,935
in any of those areas. How about you?

446
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:32,229
No. Not really. I mean, it really anyway it get a whole lot of a sailing,

447
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:33,609
but it doesn't

448
00:27:33,964 --> 00:27:35,944
really get into that. But i know what?

449
00:27:36,964 --> 00:27:45,075
It's fun. And I think he gives him little chance to work on, like, he was mainly he's doing in the art, and this was based off of some other, but somebody else's the story.

450
00:27:45,494 --> 00:27:49,049
Right. So I mean, if you look at it from the criteria, just as our work.

451
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:51,484
Here's has a very good job.

452
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:58,184
Yeah. And and here's here's the thing about the art too. Because, again, this was a collaboration between him and Hannah.

453
00:27:58,759 --> 00:27:59,259
And

454
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:05,119
I I read a lot of background in this from that graphic novel that I mentioned the Gladstone published.

455
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,551
And their editor at the time had had really cool

456
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:11,823
write ups of some of stories.

457
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:14,415
So I'm gonna refer to some of that, but

458
00:28:14,872 --> 00:28:17,127
Hannah was apparently responsible

459
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,578
for most of the inside

460
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:26,171
scenes. He did the art for those that took place inside and Barks focused on a lot of

461
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,581
outside natural c's and the shit.

462
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,949
Okay. That's how they kinda divided that up. So let's talk a little bit about

463
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,240
the general consensus of this story,

464
00:28:39,838 --> 00:28:48,807
I'm gonna be referring in these episodes to the ratings on the website index. That's i n d u c k.

465
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:51,598
And that's a fan site where they aggregate

466
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,666
people's thoughts and information for a lot of the

467
00:28:56,418 --> 00:28:58,176
the Disney comic stories.

468
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:03,030
So this one has a rating of seven point three out of ten

469
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:09,726
which is good for six hundred and forty first out of over forty thousand worries.

470
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:15,350
So that'd be what in the top five percent or so. But

471
00:29:16,527 --> 00:29:19,840
relative to most of the Barks stories, it's pretty low.

472
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:22,234
I would say that this

473
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:25,154
this story is is generally regarded

474
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:28,314
pretty well, but mostly as a notable

475
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,887
story and a little bit of a curiosity.

476
00:29:31,386 --> 00:29:33,125
I'm sure it has its fans.

477
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:39,871
But, you know, it... It's it's the first Barks story. So it's gonna be notable for that reason.

478
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:48,652
As far as my personal opinion of this story, you know, I didn't talk about my memories up. But I do remember getting this album

479
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:52,681
and being really excited because the cover looks. So

480
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:59,007
It it really grabs me, you know? Right the pair and the treasure chest and Donald

481
00:29:59,586 --> 00:30:06,579
and I was I enjoyed it because I enjoyed all of these comments, but I definitely remember a little bit of a sense of let down

482
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:14,474
because it was so different from the other Barks stories that I'd read. And I didn't realize that it was his first one

483
00:30:14,894 --> 00:30:16,454
until after I'd had read it.

484
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:20,700
And it it definitely made a lot more sense at that point.

485
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:24,351
I really... I think I liked the beginning

486
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:32,324
of the story the best kind of the setup and all the table setting and the the really suspense moment where Yellow

487
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,174
appears and and pete is Ea drop. I thought that was

488
00:30:37,673 --> 00:30:39,470
some pretty cool mood.

489
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:41,581
I also

490
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,573
really like some of the kind of

491
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:48,857
geography the little how they set up the island

492
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:56,860
itself and some of the cool landmarks. You know, I didn't talk about the skeleton tree that they had to follow, but I thought that was some really neat part.

493
00:30:57,434 --> 00:30:57,513
Yeah.

494
00:30:58,551 --> 00:31:03,242
And then, you know, the the middle sequence, it kinda runs together a bit because it's...

495
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,358
It's got all that

496
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:07,369
action

497
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:13,802
without any dialogue, and that's kind of a double edged sword. Right? Because it's really neat to see

498
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:17,774
but I I find it's easy to really flipped through it

499
00:31:18,154 --> 00:31:19,294
kinda quickly

500
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:22,414
None of it really stuck with me. I hadn't...

501
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,949
I hadn't read this one in many many years and I

502
00:31:26,888 --> 00:31:28,587
I barely remembered,

503
00:31:28,966 --> 00:31:34,180
you know, I only really remember the beginning. I think that's what had the only part that it really stuck out

504
00:31:34,534 --> 00:31:36,592
in my mind, the whole

505
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,190
from Going

506
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:45,392
and Al that senior. Makes sense. So I mean in in general, I I don't think this is a great story,

507
00:31:45,848 --> 00:31:46,348
but

508
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:50,471
I I appreciate it a lot. I enjoy it as, you know,

509
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:55,393
showing Carl Barks potential what he would go on to do.

510
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,659
I do like some of the art a lot

511
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,999
How about what was your impression of this? Well, logged me when I first I was like, wow,

512
00:32:06,852 --> 00:32:09,604
they did the dumb like version of Treasure island.

513
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:12,676
The whole, you know,

514
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:26,684
old pirate that comes in. I've got a secret with people are after, you know, kind of a deal and I need someone to take me out of shit, let's go get some random kid and of people involved and you'll find a ship. All of the shit is by pirate

515
00:32:27,104 --> 00:32:35,179
who. We have now smart them and get the treasure, but then they give treasure, but then we get it back. It's like, okay. And again, you're pointing out that

516
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:38,059
call Barks just in part on this.

517
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,274
So I don't know if... I mean, just my line as a capital fan, because that count as a Carl war story

518
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:53,756
right, quotes? Or is it just his work? Because he didn't write this and his writing especially later on because he's very different with how he does as as its adventures.

519
00:32:54,413 --> 00:32:55,791
This deals... The story

520
00:32:56,344 --> 00:32:57,363
people's formula,

521
00:32:58,022 --> 00:32:59,021
but it's still fun.

522
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:06,989
Yellow a big is a great character. I don't know. Do know... You tell me favor friday? You'll be Barks any other form? A Disney or Mickey mouse or anything?

523
00:33:07,749 --> 00:33:08,249
What.

524
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:11,369
He he does come back a little bit. We'll

525
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:17,672
we'll talk a little bit about that. Oh Okay. Should be here. No. I'm I'm glad you asked about that.

526
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:22,576
Because he seems like a fun character particularly you know, the question of...

527
00:33:23,154 --> 00:33:23,893
How do you

528
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:25,189
tattoo to a pair?

529
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,521
The i came to mind mind am my.

530
00:33:29,153 --> 00:33:30,292
That's gonna be interesting.

531
00:33:30,828 --> 00:33:39,839
Oh. And you know, I'm sorry to interrupt you. I I forgot to mention that I I liked Yellow, but I also found him in incredibly

532
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:40,819
unsettling.

533
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,139
Right? Because he is a parent.

534
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:46,519
And and he's parent sized

535
00:33:47,953 --> 00:33:56,015
And I didn't really know how to to read him because most of these Ducktales. These animal characters are not the normal size.

536
00:33:56,548 --> 00:34:02,396
So, like, am I supposed to read him as, like, being a human like character or a parent like

537
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:06,400
Like, at first, I thought Huey, was just a but the pirates talking.

538
00:34:06,936 --> 00:34:08,830
Right. Okay. Yeah. And

539
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:09,707
and

540
00:34:10,203 --> 00:34:10,761
acts, like,

541
00:34:11,558 --> 00:34:16,183
just the regular quote human character like all of them do. So i I found him

542
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:18,317
pretty weird.

543
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:24,081
And and like from the moment. Remember the Red cactus this shoulder, but it's still a crew member.

544
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,248
We, the the the cactus there, it happens to be a very essential period that is

545
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:35,230
there. And... That's that's on saturday and think about that because with these, you know,

546
00:34:36,387 --> 00:34:37,326
we think it

547
00:34:37,982 --> 00:34:38,482
changes

548
00:34:39,274 --> 00:34:42,171
you don't usually think about them as being done.

549
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:47,264
Yes. This story made me think about him, and that that definitely brought me out of it.

550
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:55,871
That that makes sense. I think sometimes he was much the least in various economics. But... Yeah. No. I i think that head now... So

551
00:34:56,464 --> 00:35:01,244
you know, this one was always gonna be a little bit different just because of the nature of the story.

552
00:35:02,744 --> 00:35:10,693
Definitely a notable one. Some some reflections, I'd like to take some time in in these episodes to talk about

553
00:35:11,312 --> 00:35:26,433
how well the story holds up if there's any thing archaic or dated. And you know, this one because it's so episodic, I I don't feel like you. It it almost feels like it could be of of almost any time, you know? I mean, there's not a lot of, like, modern

554
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:29,644
indicators or anything that pulled me out

555
00:35:30,142 --> 00:35:36,500
the way some stories do. But I think that might be more Al effective just how how spa.

556
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:43,929
I mean, I would think nowadays if they're doing it, I think you'll be easier to have pee being old man.

557
00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:51,507
Sure and and that kind of a thing instead of making him a woman. Yeah gone a little bit. That definitely a little bit out of style.

558
00:35:52,522 --> 00:35:54,709
But, again, that was just par for the course

559
00:35:55,248 --> 00:35:58,621
But I don't think there's anything that really needs to be kind of

560
00:35:59,918 --> 00:36:00,418
explained

561
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:03,470
That was just... That was just, you know, part of the time.

562
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:06,593
Yeah. I needed to disguise it's it's fine.

563
00:36:07,868 --> 00:36:08,567
Had asked

564
00:36:08,984 --> 00:36:09,484
about

565
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,838
other appearances

566
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:18,374
So I wanna talk at this point in the episode about appearances and other media. I'll jump a little bit to okay.

567
00:36:19,412 --> 00:36:20,391
Other appearances

568
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:28,164
for Yellow beak. So so the weird thing that they did is they recycled this story a lot in Disney economists.

569
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:29,079
Oh, really?

570
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:32,935
This wants to? Like, they would basically

571
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:37,070
reprint this but with different characters following this sketch. Like,

572
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:38,941
They used the

573
00:36:39,518 --> 00:36:40,776
peter pan characters.

574
00:36:41,113 --> 00:36:45,242
I think Captain Hook basically played the black p role and one of the

575
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,798
later four colors

576
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:54,610
I think there might have been some book adaptations of it or something. But I thought it I found it to be very

577
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,943
weird that they kept going back to this

578
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,272
very cliche shade like, bare bones story.

579
00:37:02,468 --> 00:37:06,815
That's true. Yeah. Yep the one had some kind of popularity that we weren't aware of.

580
00:37:07,428 --> 00:37:12,610
Yeah. Or it did this a story that Disney owned, and didn't have to pay for another rider to do.

581
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:15,361
Yeah. That might be the case.

582
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:19,743
There was a sequel to this that was published

583
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:24,208
Barks didn't do it. I don't remember. I don't think it was a very notable

584
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,020
story, but they they did bring him back

585
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,280
for a follow ups story at some point.

586
00:37:33,214 --> 00:37:33,994
And then

587
00:37:34,493 --> 00:37:41,240
I have not seen this personally yet You know, we we're gonna talk at this point about if there's

588
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,960
ever been Al appearance

589
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,780
a reference to the Ducktales,

590
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:50,214
which, you know, is it can be a little bit divisive among Barks and some of them really appreciate

591
00:37:50,912 --> 00:37:53,170
those some don't, but

592
00:37:54,508 --> 00:38:02,056
he never appeared in the first series. But apparently, he has a pretty notable appearance in the third season.

593
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:12,654
Right. And I Seen the thirties yet. I'm waiting for it to finish I can stream the whole thing. Right. I've only seen it on what what they have on Disney Plus myself.

594
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:17,860
So that'll be Al episode to look forward to. It's called the first adventure.

595
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,060
Do you mind if I

596
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,780
what

597
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,675
four part of it? So

598
00:38:24,175 --> 00:38:26,315
apparently, he appears as a re

599
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:28,475
skeleton of himself.

600
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:31,335
And he is the villain.

601
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:42,445
And and it sounds like it's a reference to, you know, Barks for a story calling that up. So first adventure sure. The

602
00:38:43,025 --> 00:38:49,498
people may not like them or barton do had appreciate or it have their own opinions on them, but from what I've seen in that cartoons,

603
00:38:50,196 --> 00:38:54,931
the guys behind it, are fans of not just the original that, but the original

604
00:38:55,765 --> 00:39:02,225
of a lot of the references. The Barks our spectrum background are they have in there. And. And and maybe devices, but

605
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:07,075
you know what if you're family you're trying to get it in there? I think that's good after you can't

606
00:39:07,534 --> 00:39:13,845
hard to things everybody all the time. But... Oh, I definitely there. Agree. I agree. I appreciate the Barks references.

607
00:39:14,305 --> 00:39:18,285
I sometimes feel a little bit weird about where they go with them. But

608
00:39:18,665 --> 00:39:21,337
you know, I I enjoy it as it's own thing.

609
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,973
The the other media

610
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:25,451
is the

611
00:39:26,204 --> 00:39:38,005
Barks does a lot of oil paintings. We have talked about this. I'd mentioned this in the previous episode. So if there's a corresponding oil painting, I'm not gonna go to in because this is a podcast

612
00:39:38,464 --> 00:39:40,961
and is not a visual media.

613
00:39:41,874 --> 00:39:47,708
There is an oil painting titled returned to Morgan's Islands that I think is really cool.

614
00:39:48,507 --> 00:39:55,869
I'm hoping to get a Facebook page up for these So so I'll post a visual for that. But but look up that one.

615
00:39:56,706 --> 00:40:01,731
I think it's a really neat one. It shows that cool skeleton tree. In the round of it.

616
00:40:02,508 --> 00:40:08,116
I also took a look for this episode out at the going rate for the original

617
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:10,444
print four color number nine.

618
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:17,703
Just for reference right now, the the lowest ebay listing I saw was six hundred and ninety nine dollars.

619
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:19,034
And

620
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:22,703
up to twenty six hundred dollars.

621
00:40:24,874 --> 00:40:25,893
Depending on

622
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,568
on the condition.

623
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:38,189
Let's see. Like the d collectors you gotta pay for that. That's sure. Oh, yeah. Well, this is definitely an an important piece of, you know, Barks

624
00:40:38,907 --> 00:40:46,066
history, Barks more yeah. Look at the pricing of these, but like, there's a lot. Well when you think of the history of them and actually, how well Mean that's

625
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:49,119
That's a nineteen forty two.

626
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:52,579
That's the what... Yeah. Year old almost made go to comic.

627
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:58,550
Maybe yeah. Shouldn't would be worth that much. Those are that expensive and so rare. Definitely golden age.

628
00:40:59,669 --> 00:41:03,365
So I'm trying to think I I think I covered everything that I

629
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,648
looks to talk about. I'm not trying to be exhaustive, but,

630
00:41:08,504 --> 00:41:13,170
you know, any any closing thoughts that you got about Donald Duck name's Clerical.

631
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:18,025
I mean, as I've mentioned before, and I don't want... I can know what that do in the head.

632
00:41:18,865 --> 00:41:19,365
The

633
00:41:19,785 --> 00:41:21,579
art in this is

634
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:22,618
tremendous.

635
00:41:23,993 --> 00:41:29,001
Even just the the minor characters, that it it's all well done. The facial reactions

636
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:33,729
but it's the big scenes that are obviously Karl Barks the codes

637
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:38,539
and some of the silhouette, it's just tremendously done

638
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:40,059
for that error

639
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,380
for the detail and expressions

640
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,660
and

641
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:51,776
if you look at some of these shots, I don't... I'm looking at one where the boat is coming over a wave

642
00:41:52,392 --> 00:41:57,179
The the water's moving. There's moving the water. It's coming up as the. The sales are full

643
00:41:57,479 --> 00:42:03,314
and you see a pot of dolphins out ahead of the boat as the sunset goes behind it these pink

644
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:07,525
the pink sunset out the yellow scott, and I look at that, and I'm like, yes.

645
00:42:08,363 --> 00:42:11,715
Obviously, he's going to the oil painting slate on Al light because that is.

646
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:13,745
Just not a beautiful

647
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:14,480
scene.

648
00:42:15,078 --> 00:42:18,766
And he has several of those with the of the irish particularly

649
00:42:19,182 --> 00:42:19,881
I'm thinking

650
00:42:20,234 --> 00:42:27,154
think Barks really like higher boats. I that. This kinda seems he must have enjoyed this and had some real fun.

651
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:29,134
You don't often get

652
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,817
just beautiful arc Inducks con book Nowadays it

653
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:37,932
this his comic has goes all over the place it's kind of experimental

654
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:49,784
like you said, I I think that's really cool you pointed out about the facial expressions. There's some pretty pretty great facial expressions in here. I I kinda got hung up on the lack of detail on some of the backgrounds.

655
00:42:50,583 --> 00:43:01,464
But that's very. But I do think you're right. There's some really cool artwork. And you know, Barks famously loved to refer reference old issues of National geographic.

656
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:12,593
And I know he did that with some of the nautical stuff for this. Awesome. Well, Eric, thank you so much for joining me for this. I really pleasure.

657
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,866
I'm I'm excited to to keep going.

658
00:43:17,402 --> 00:43:17,902
Our...

659
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,379
Our next

660
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,789
episode is going to

661
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:25,501
talk about Donald Duck and the mum ring

662
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:41,897
So please join us for that one. And if you have any thoughts or comments, you can drop us Al line at Barks remarks at g mail dot com. Mh Good email. Yeah. Fancy. Right. Well, thank you again. You're welcome, Barks and we'll stay next time.
