Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever a Grown man who loves comics, and I'm joined by a couple of other grown men

4
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:58,687
we're gonna talk today about

5
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:03,365
what I consider to be a great classic Barks story.

6
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,720
We'll be talking about the seasonally appropriate cold bargain, at least pretty cold where I am. And

7
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:18,748
I am joined by a returning guest who is a comet book fan, but a Carl Barks newbie,

8
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:26,015
and that's Ryan. Say hello, Ryan. Hello, everyone. And then as as a new guest, I'm joined by Va

9
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:28,249
Who is

10
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:34,848
joining us by way of from Poland, but by way of Finland. Right? You are a finish fan bay? Yes.

11
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:36,760
Room. Excellent.

12
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,015
So so, Ryan, I was wondering have you ever gotten over extended in an off.

13
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:50,354
Probably not the extent that he did. I... I've never spent a trillion dollars on anything. I do

14
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:52,986
collect auto graphs, and sometimes

15
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:58,767
If you're keeping an eye out for the good pieces, sometimes you see a good piece that you know you're not gonna see again.

16
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:01,941
And I remember there was one in one

17
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:20,540
collector group. I was in... Someone was selling his pieces that had already been dedicated, meaning it said two so sell, But they said to Ryan, and and so there was a a hands drawn picture by matt Grain of Lisa Simpson saying hi, Ryan and then signed by Matt Gran and david, and then another one

18
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:30,874
Edna mo from the incredibles drawn by Brad Bird and signed right bad Bradford that also said Hi Ryan No cape. And both of those were so choice.

19
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:37,932
Pretty. And they were both of those guys are pretty expensive on their own, like, what would be probably a few hundred

20
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:40,343
depending on the circumstances, but

21
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:49,982
they were little cheaper because who would want one that's already dedicated to someone else, you know, that has someone else's name on them. So Sure So it was a very good deal for me, but also

22
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:53,549
a little more than I would usually spend, but they were so excellent.

23
00:02:54,347 --> 00:03:02,415
Are hard to pass up. Right? Awesome. And how about you waco, this is your first time joining me on the podcast.

24
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:12,769
When people join me for the first time, I like to learn a a little bit about them as as Carl Barks fans and and you know, your own perspectives. So, you know, tell us about how long you've been reading Barks.

25
00:03:13,662 --> 00:03:17,391
Well, I've been reading Barks as long as I can remember because

26
00:03:18,206 --> 00:03:22,987
Al a lot of finished to learn of my generation and also for generation,

27
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:24,343
reasons I

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,018
grew up reading

29
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:41,120
down magazine or first having it read to me and then learning could rate course from it. Pretty much as far I again, I can remember, I was also aware of car Barks as as this guy who who with the best double

30
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,640
clinics. When I was growing up in the mid eighty was a

31
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,135
period for the fish downtime

32
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:49,133
magazine

33
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:50,689
they they had this

34
00:03:51,785 --> 00:03:52,285
editorial

35
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:56,808
column sort of similar to the one that that that was the American

36
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:00,319
issues Al at at the time and they was often feature

37
00:04:00,856 --> 00:04:01,556
articles there

38
00:04:02,213 --> 00:04:03,364
about car Barks

39
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:04,805
Car was

40
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:12,934
after time I I think the only are still they mentioned by name. I mean all the the already in the in the the comic book we're still

41
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,723
not credited even even Barks.

42
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,320
But

43
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:19,644
it was sort of an open secret that that this

44
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:26,595
we could come we're probably by white Barks and and and his name last was mentioned there. And and and they they also

45
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:27,608
answered

46
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:33,004
letters from the from the Burritos. Yeah. He's always been like the the good Ducktales artist.

47
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:53,126
Yeah. It's it's so fun hearing to me. It's so fun hearing about European readers who had this experience that I I wish I'd had, you know, being read to karl Barks to me. I was just... I was lucky to find it. They revive the the series back when Ducktales was was launched. But, yeah, it's great. A lot of a lot of Scandinavian

48
00:04:53,702 --> 00:04:55,597
and european readers have similar

49
00:04:56,094 --> 00:05:00,359
experiences to you. Do you... Do you have any favorites stories that are, like, really

50
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,139
significant to you maker.

51
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:03,059
Well,

52
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:10,212
since we are getting here the Christmas or or in the christmas season and I I I would like to mention one of my

53
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:11,251
stories

54
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,889
a little to stan

55
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:29,275
that must be my favorites of the birth Christmas stories and and it's it's also one of the earliest that I can remember from my childhood because it it was first published in finished on like magazine in the day, this when I when it was tried. So I I and remember it coming out in this

56
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:30,134
installations.

57
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:36,071
Just before Christmas I nineteen eighty five or or nine eighty six. So there's not that's one of the

58
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:50,557
recent and still one of my every stories Oh, yeah. A big fan of letters to Santa. That's that's a great Barks Christmas story. So eighty five eighty six. I think you started reading just the brown the same time I did. It was probably lady...

59
00:05:50,997 --> 00:06:27,461
Probably early eighty seven for me. I'm gonna guess. Donald Duck and Magazine is Ak An. Is that how you say it? Oh, yes. Yep. Okay. I've I've I've never actually heard it settle out, so I was kinda curious. Awesome. Thank you so much for joining us. Faith go Alright. So gentlemen, I'm really excited to talk about this. This is a long time favorite of mine. I I came across like, a a list on one of my old computers that I had made of some of my favorite Carl Barks stories a couple of decades ago. And I did mention this on, like, my top ten list. I don't know that I'd put it quite up that high these days, but I I have...

60
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,960
There's like, Al place in my heart for this story. I think there's a lot about it that works really well.

61
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:51,595
Kind of the the unspoken premise of this series that I guess I'm staying out loud is that all of these stories are worth talking about But I think this one is is more worth talking about than than a lot of them. Because we've got like this really neat cold war in intrigued

62
00:06:52,815 --> 00:07:28,730
in in a cold bargain. I mean, you know, right in the title, it's kind of a evo of of the thing of the cold war and the United States is like nuclear stand with the Soviet Union. And Bark is gonna... You know, the the comics came out of the second world War Barks was he started doing them when the Us was in the midst of it. And so a lot of the stories were informed by that. Ryan, you were you with me in some of the... Those earlier stories I I imagine even if it's not over, you can probably see a lot of the undertone

63
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:41,769
Right? How can you escape it? I'm thinking especially of, like, when we did tear of the river, and you know, what the c sharpen bent that one felt very informed. By World War two. And this is the other great geo

64
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:50,441
political conflict that's gonna kind of... That's gonna kind of under occurred what Barks is doing and he doesn't often go as, like

65
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,955
obvious into it as he does in this story. But but for that reason, it's really

66
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,607
historically interesting to me.

67
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:03,401
Ryan, were you kinda thinking about about that history as you read this one?

68
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:11,074
A little bit. Yeah. I thought It actually seemed a lot more focused on those kinds of things than the other ones were. The other one seemed more

69
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,267
kind of more like

70
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:14,917
national geographic,

71
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:23,869
explore the world, kind of these are interesting cultures and exploring the bottom of the sea and finding the lost night and Right. All these other things

72
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:36,710
that could happen in in any time any kind of adventure story, it could been an edgar categorized burrows apple you know. Yeah. A lot of the ones that I had you joined for were were kinda more of those early, like, almost travel log stories that Barks did.

73
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:51,705
I guess you could kinda call them post colonial in a lot of ways. But... Yeah. What what about you waco? You know, someone who grew up kind of on the edge of the eastern block. I imagine that that to you the the cold war

74
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:59,425
elements really stand out in this one. Well, yes. I mean, especially when I was re reread it now, I I was

75
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,440
taking off the cold war aspect.

76
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,300
I would say,

77
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,000
even even more than when I originally

78
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,200
already. I I I don't have any very

79
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:18,561
strong recollection of actually first reading this this this story, but I remember they will when I got the

80
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:21,650
publication waived was first published in

81
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,330
in in in finland

82
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,610
because it very unusual in that it

83
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,581
appear in the actual downtime magazine

84
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:33,055
instead it was published in this

85
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:34,970
paper Barks series that

86
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:36,567
I'm sure all the

87
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,365
Al notes are are very familiar with. And probably some Al and German

88
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:43,482
well because

89
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,255
they the same series was published in

90
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:47,295
conditions.

91
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,335
This series of paper Barks about

92
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,270
two hundred pages each

93
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,230
that usually, feature said this

94
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,470
very weird italian

95
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,910
doctor and and

96
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,030
our stories

97
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,150
there

98
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:04,202
they can be pretty surreal and rendering

99
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:06,000
end. And

100
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,118
that's fair. Yeah. Yeah. And

101
00:10:08,577 --> 00:10:10,895
get a little odd. Right right. And then they yes.

102
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,328
To have

103
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:14,084
value

104
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:17,754
more bit than

105
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:23,876
done done right weird. And so so this this the series generally

106
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:26,989
bit of like a bargain basement quality

107
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:33,463
only the... Every second page or base was colors. So so that the

108
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,705
like a white pages. I'll do with the experiments. But but suddenly in the fiftieth

109
00:10:40,365 --> 00:10:45,905
installment of this series, which came out in nineteen eighty. But but but in this fifty is

110
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,520
suddenly published,

111
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:55,852
not only this this story I called Bargain, but two other Barks stories well the secret of the is and

112
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:57,610
the city of golden groups.

113
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:02,580
And and none of those service have had had come out in in in finish

114
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:19,597
before... So so so this this really certain event. And and usually, this story I called Barks is is is one that finish Barks fans remember. From that the paper remember that this was the book very could finally published. Because of course,

115
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:20,690
when the

116
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:29,222
when it was originally published in the United States in ninety fifty seven, the this this was a very very difficult time for

117
00:11:30,212 --> 00:11:32,187
finland and and the ob Union,

118
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,972
especially the late and Oracle early when this could

119
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:38,860
come out in.

120
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:41,377
So so

121
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:43,774
it wasn't published in in

122
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:48,661
and in fact it wasn't published in any of the and that

123
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:55,401
that published don't coming Al the time. So not in denmark. Sweden or norway way. And I...

124
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:56,877
But I imagine

125
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:01,875
Sorry to... Sorry to interrupt like, like as you're saying here it would have been especially

126
00:12:02,611 --> 00:12:07,410
sensitive probably to publish it in finland that that time. Right? Yes. Yes,

127
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:16,380
especially since in in in those years, that and the unit did have this crisis where the so but

128
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,620
withdraw their ambassadors from Finland and

129
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,540
there all these

130
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,312
negotiations And if even even

131
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,829
cartoons were,

132
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:27,785
I mean, I mean, political

133
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:32,096
were sometimes been involved in in all this because there was

134
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,230
one

135
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,550
political cartoon particular

136
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:41,405
who room for the biggest finish daily paper and he often had to care yourself

137
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:42,842
any nikita

138
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:44,755
shop with also

139
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:55,019
in this in Barks. Sorry or Al least. That's that's what some people say And he got to the point in ninety fifty nine that actually the finished

140
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:59,063
at the time. We're okay. And had to apologize for this

141
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,494
carlton that were have published in this.

142
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,327
They use newspaper.

143
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:07,288
Some representative And it's

144
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:10,082
important for Contact transactions because

145
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:15,711
the magazine was part of this same publishing house that that also published is

146
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:35,691
this daily newspaper and and that was also the finished publisher of reader tires, I guess. Oh so so they would have been... They would have been paying attention by then. Yes. I I think I very very that that you might have actually had had the situation where the president has to Al for. Yeah. Is it fair to say,

147
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:36,968
do you think

148
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:43,568
do you think it's fair to say that this story had it been published could Barks the geopolitical crisis? Oh yes. Absolutely

149
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:45,142
or these being.

150
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,397
Or at least some friction.

151
00:13:48,173 --> 00:14:04,702
Yeah. Yeah. Right. It would it would have probably sparked an international apology. That's that's really fascinating to me. And and to be clear, you know, I think this is a great story in its own regard. I'm not just interested in talking about it. As as a cold were terrible

152
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,082
or or whatever. But I think this is a really fun... No. I saw someone

153
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:18,815
somewhere say that it's almost unfair to call this Al adventure story because it's like, it's it's a pretty slaps stick wrong. It's it's very funny.

154
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,887
It definitely has, like, the tone and the trapping

155
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:32,924
or the setting of an adventure story, but it's it's it's very far too in a way that I really like Yes. Yes. I I I agree with that, and that's also the reason why it's one of my favorites

156
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:33,962
of this

157
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:35,239
late fifties

158
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:41,196
Scrooge stories. I'm I'm not such great fan of the more adventure type

159
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:43,030
stories. The the ones that take

160
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:48,486
places on exotic places and and whether hunting pictures or ryan.

161
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:49,085
Yeah.

162
00:14:49,962 --> 00:15:16,114
Yeah something that I'm observing as I do the series is that, like, the real Barks fans, you know, they they kinda think more highly of a lot of the ten pages Oh For my part, you know, the podcast, it's just more interesting to talk about the adventure price. But I do loved talking about that, you know, we've got the ten page podcast for that. I have a new question. Yeah. I love I love new questions. What part of what I've got you on here for, you know So

163
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:31,740
the first episode, probably the first few episodes, I was on, The comic was called Donald Inducks Adventures. And this comic is called Uncle Scrooge, and I was wondering if this is like a sql series or if there are multiple series running parallel, that is a good quest.

164
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:32,819
So

165
00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:55,098
the these have been reprinted so many times. Right? That the scans that I would have sent you, they'd have been from titles that only existed later on, you know, the Donald Duck Adventures and uncle Scrooge adventures series. Most of the ones you were originally on for would have been published in a series called four color or one shot where it

166
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:56,573
every

167
00:15:57,244 --> 00:16:01,061
issue, it might have been like bugs bunny one issue and then little lulu,

168
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,418
And eventually, Western Publishing,

169
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,895
if they had, like a breakout issue,

170
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:09,801
they might spin that off into its own title.

171
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,070
You know? So that that happens for both uncle Scrooge,

172
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:20,145
and and Donald duck, the the on the strength of the Carl Barks stories. Western

173
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:22,065
spun them off into

174
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:30,240
uncle Scrooge you know, only a poor man was was basically his trial. That was a big deal that he got his own character

175
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,060
spun off into its own.

176
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:33,054
Lined.

177
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:45,682
And he was the Uncle Scrooge comments line. It was a bim monthly comic, I believe, for the most part. And they only published it for the first. Many years of its existence when there was new Barks content.

178
00:16:46,020 --> 00:17:01,180
But but it's safe to say that Barks career is kinda split into the Donald focused stuff. And then the Scrooge focus stuff. Right? So so I'll kinda transition here into the the comic itself. Right? Because we're up to uncle Scrooge number seventeen

179
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,260
at this point. It's only been around for a a few years

180
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,520
as a title.

181
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,675
As Said this one was... It had a cover date at least to early nineteen fifty seven.

182
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:15,755
And this one's been reprinted nine times.

183
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,135
So, Ryan, you know,

184
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:24,650
the first printing would have been is the uncle Scrooge title. But then it it'll... It'll it might be published in whatever.

185
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:29,205
You know, kind of lineup up, they think that they're running at the time,

186
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:38,434
basically in in Disney Comics hay for a while. There was enough material to support Al uncle Scrooge and an uncle Scrooge Adventures

187
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:52,797
And and that that nice golden age when when V and I started reading. Yeah. So let's see. This one is page length wise, this one is kind of a... It's a longer story. It's almost twenty seven pages.

188
00:17:53,135 --> 00:18:03,175
We've already talked a little bit about some of the kind of culture and the history behind and this one, which is I think very interesting. But They, you mentioned Scrooge

189
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,475
shove, is russian one of your languages?

190
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:06,215
Yes.

191
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:10,086
Russian, actually, my first foreign language

192
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:16,134
nice in in the is school. So how should we all be pronouncing his name? K shift? Gru

193
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,047
well, I I think the

194
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:19,084
standard

195
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,080
English

196
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:24,200
or or the other way of writing it is full ship

197
00:18:24,778 --> 00:18:29,146
However, in Russian, be pronounced first job oh crucial.

198
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:30,202
Okay. With the.

199
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:34,051
Yeah. So Ryan, did you did you catch

200
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:43,606
that... Oh, I'm I'm spacing on the word for a carrier that that kara couture, did you recognize him as a whoo shove character?

201
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:45,139
The B

202
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:48,535
ambassador? No. But, definitely not. I could probably...

203
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:54,222
I could probably recognize the stall analog, but I I actually don't know what cruise job looks like.

204
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,455
Yeah. So I think I think he kinda famously

205
00:18:58,032 --> 00:19:02,660
has that sort of ball dome and that slightly a regular

206
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:12,937
shape to his head I think most people who who know what what the but that the Premier. Right? They were premier back then? Yeah. From

207
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:14,052
so up

208
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,324
the chairman would probably have recognized him as being a.

209
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:25,203
However, I did... I'm so glad that I looked Al my glad

210
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:36,117
reprint because there's a quote from barb at the end. You know, it ends with that weird, like, cutoff off page where it's three fourth of a page. And Gladstone chose to put a small

211
00:19:36,736 --> 00:19:39,652
exchange that Barks made. I think it was in one of his letters.

212
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:41,530
Called the trillion dollar ball.

213
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:48,518
And and in it, he said he poses this question that fans have asked him was the B

214
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:49,336
ambassador,

215
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:50,895
anybody in particular?

216
00:19:51,590 --> 00:20:06,049
No He was a composite of power hungry arms spiders from many nations with no. I should probably have given him the face of one of my sn pig villains that appeared a lot in later years. But I wanted to make him look

217
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:11,729
international. So that's what he officially says, but I'm I'm gonna call Bs.

218
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:14,122
I'm gonna say that he is clearly

219
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:19,936
intended to my eye to be a a cruise shove. Kara could show. What what do you think there?

220
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:25,629
Yes. Mean I I also read that statement from Barks and it's it's a it's a bit

221
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,701
but puzzling. I I I like to know what

222
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:31,133
exactly what's the behind I. I

223
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,467
Gladstone

224
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:34,654
right to Barks and and asking through

225
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,373
write something and

226
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:46,774
they did birth maybe right, just kind of a tom cheek notes to go because he basically this allows any cold war connections for the already also says that it it's...

227
00:20:47,553 --> 00:20:52,700
Such suggest that is complete coincidence that the elements that after called.

228
00:20:54,036 --> 00:21:13,470
Just that... Yeah. Do you wanna read us? The the other part I left out that here, you know what? Let me... I'll just mention the ask jim, and then I'll have you read that that quote in just a moment. Because this is the other element to the the story that I find really cool. It it's one of the many many pieces of pop culture

229
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:27,603
where the creator has to, like, make up an invented element. And and I love that. And in this case, it's called... It's called Ba. And I think that it's one of the best names of these, like fake elements.

230
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:35,297
You guys we we can all probably think of a few, you know, other movies and shows that have used pretend elements

231
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:37,508
do do either of you guys have

232
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:47,810
have a a favorite that comes to mind? You know, like, I think people would probably commonly think of, like, una titanium. Is that is that what Avatar called it? Yeah.

233
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:54,718
Possibly. I've never seen movies. So... Yeah. It's it's a it's a pretty on the nose one. Marvel

234
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:59,032
themselves have a couple of different ones, right? Like Adam

235
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:01,685
and by, is the,

236
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:04,505
the one from pond Al

237
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,845
and the black hand.

238
00:22:06,265 --> 00:22:06,345
Yeah.

239
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:18,590
My one of my favorite series dis world has oc iron that there's just so many of these, and they're always a lot of fun. And So, you wanna tell us the the quote that Barks has in that about

240
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:28,016
Jim. I just remembered. Yes. I'm looking. No. Now. I'm looking Al a a a list of fictional elements. One of which is Bombastic on the on the Wikipedia.

241
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:34,249
But I was just reminded of element zero from Mass effect. Nice from back in the day,

242
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:37,197
Mass effect has really, really Ducktales,

243
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:37,737
like

244
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:44,645
history and everything I kind of explain everything in the game if you're willing to learn it all. And they... In this

245
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:52,282
fictional future, they've discovered element zero, which if you run a current through it, it makes something have no mass,

246
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:59,640
which then... And under under the laws of relativity, now you can fire that thing past the speed of light because it's not breaking any rules. And

247
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:13,948
so they kind of came up with this can t the reason why we're allowed to travel the galaxy in this game. And the charts like Yeah cool. It's neat when they'll actually try justification and and some of these elements are just, like really valuable,

248
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:22,179
where some of them do something very specific like in the case of this story. They go Why don't tell us what what Barks says about Mom.

249
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:25,774
Yes. So so here's the quote Barks.

250
00:23:26,194 --> 00:23:27,434
Back in the nineteen fifties,

251
00:23:27,794 --> 00:23:31,334
the financial news and most scientific publications

252
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:52,266
we're servicing with tongue twisting names of new elements that signed were recently shifting from rare or sputtering on the walls of cycle phones. I don't find boom yet in the table of elements but I won't be app surprised if it suddenly appears. Scientists will surely run up letters at some point. And have to use b

253
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:59,573
sooner or later. So so there is a sort of suggesting that if it was, you know, just a going is study having to have this

254
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,889
b o n

255
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:03,441
sure the name of the. But... Yeah, it's

256
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:09,397
it's it's it's contact that. And it make let me suspect maybe maybe

257
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:11,312
part, you know, purpose

258
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:15,000
maybe this the statement as over the top as as possible.

259
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:17,072
Huey, can

260
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:18,590
and it's gonna be taken

261
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:19,988
face feedback about.

262
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:22,045
That's... That's how say.

263
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:23,557
It it's

264
00:24:24,014 --> 00:24:26,070
definitely wondering if they... If last

265
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:28,343
order to steady statement

266
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,104
from Barks with the with the exact purpose that that if they had is kind of

267
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,744
from from Inducks to probably

268
00:24:36,445 --> 00:24:37,864
because some possible

269
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:38,445
Al.

270
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:43,777
Exactly. I said we could... Because this was the first time that these I've been in the... Yeah.

271
00:24:44,895 --> 00:24:50,283
United that as well. It it it did appear in the heart color Barks library

272
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:57,960
to use papers about every day they that never were been in the comic book for me. And and even so they they have to make some slight

273
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:02,399
the operations three to... Right. Because this one's been a little bit

274
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,320
controversial. Right? Do you wanna? Do you wanna tell us faye a little bit about the

275
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:06,980
the art?

276
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:12,924
And the and other changes that they made for this? Yeah. So so apparently, in the

277
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:17,090
glad reprint, they chased the official features of the

278
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:23,631
k off character rocket. So that he he he appear. So they typically Russian, they

279
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:27,075
removed the high cheap ones and and also made

280
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:32,978
lives less less prominent. I I I think those only to change that I I I I think he

281
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:34,972
came out with rather

282
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,338
with with the new version. And then they also

283
00:25:38,716 --> 00:25:46,002
changed the dialogue a bit so that one of the repeat advice in these stories that that is always saying to

284
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:46,740
Scrooge

285
00:25:47,393 --> 00:25:55,667
reach big of Inducks and in the glass on, they change the word did to dog. So so they they they did sort of an

286
00:25:56,218 --> 00:26:06,423
change in the other direction than what and but what the bugs would have wanted to do. And it's it's also interesting that Barks that it it it would've been better if he had actually connected to

287
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:07,422
the

288
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:14,508
leader as as a as a as a... I I I would imagine that be even even more commercial. But the

289
00:26:14,886 --> 00:26:17,779
right because, like pig is a classic criticism

290
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:19,694
of of American capitalism.

291
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:36,714
Right? So... Yes. Yeah. So he probably wasn't thinking about that when he... When he kinda tossed that off. I imagine. Yeah. Right. And I didn't tell you about this, but this one's been fairly mildly altered, I would say as far as some of the Barks stories goes, I'm not accustomed to there being like, censorship

292
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:38,271
over, you know, technically

293
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:39,567
European features.

294
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:49,625
But, of course, you know, there's a there's a history of kara characterizing your your wartime components even if cold were never turned high. Yep. So for the listeners, his head is

295
00:26:49,964 --> 00:27:00,554
extremely pointy. It's kind of an egg shape head and then he has a big big shoulders he has got a big body inside his suit that you can see there. I was I was trying to think of who it reminds me If I realized it's say

296
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:16,777
It would be the Barks bald bowl from Mike Tyson punch out. Look Al look at him again, Mark and tell me if that's not both from Mike tyson bunch of. I need the lift out ball bold because now I don't remember him Okay. All but. Yeah. You're right. Al the same the same shape. Yeah. That's funny.

297
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:18,755
And I've another

298
00:27:19,414 --> 00:27:23,164
probably in this statement from Barks that that he identifies this guy has

299
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:30,697
ambassador. But in in the help, he never no recorded. It's it's the never made clear

300
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:32,666
what... What is he Huey, he

301
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:38,571
referred to by any other title was well, but he was... You know, I think he was probably

302
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:47,036
he was probably mixing him up with the the later story swamp of no return. Because he gonna use... He's gonna use the element

303
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:56,940
you fictional country of B To, which is an obvious stand for the Soviet Union, a couple more times. He doesn't always do this. But he does have a b

304
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:12,512
ambassador in the swamp of no return. Yes. And of course you know, R help is is a clear Port tow of... I saw everyone saying brute and Utopia, but I I think it's gotta actually be brutal. And Utopia are are probably

305
00:28:12,944 --> 00:28:19,124
the true words. Right? Yeah. It's it's a great fictional country name. And and yeah. Bombastic,

306
00:28:19,704 --> 00:28:32,654
obvious, it's the word bombastic for fantastic or over the top, but but we're also evo the bomb of the of the Adam Bomb. So lots lots to talk about, so you guys

307
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:34,594
so gentlemen before we...

308
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:38,983
Before we launch into story itself. I do like to take a moment to panda

309
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:43,811
to our international listeners by talking about some of the translations

310
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:46,638
of the different titles from around the world.

311
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:58,101
So, you know, Ryan, why don't you and I each tackle one and then Va, I think they're two of them that you had wanted to mention. Alright. Ryan let's let's hear from the Italian.

312
00:28:58,818 --> 00:29:01,232
The italians called this one Z papa,

313
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:14,459
Scrooge, the sub zero treasure. So you know, Va, you didn't mention wanting to do the finish one. To me, it's kinda funny if I do the finish one and you can, like, react to mine.

314
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:17,951
So, you know, I've I've gotta a finish

315
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:26,348
guests today. So why don't I go ahead. I'll I'll try... I... I've mentioned this before. Finish. I find one of the most

316
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:27,226
intimidating

317
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:33,753
languages to try to do these for. So you you let me know how poorly I do. It is called Q.

318
00:29:34,812 --> 00:29:37,125
A cold trade in most of the finish

319
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,164
translations.

320
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,160
Yes. That's a very very good very good

321
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:45,415
pronunciation. Alright. Wow. What would it sound like if you said it.

322
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,429
I I think there's also Al

323
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,170
also title,

324
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,490
which a bit longer

325
00:29:53,482 --> 00:29:59,510
which is, you know, just the sending but with the hugo Scrooge. Right. In in in france of uncle Scrooge

326
00:30:00,428 --> 00:30:07,285
called by or called Bargain. Nice. Excellent. So they, which which two interested you? Right. So

327
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:12,683
well in keeping with the cold team of this story, I I I thought that a couple of

328
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,746
languages. Yeah So in in Russian this store is called Ia Pac.

329
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:20,914
Which is a pretty straightforward

330
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:21,949
translation

331
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:24,579
some like Icy bargain or

332
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:26,252
I buy and

333
00:30:26,604 --> 00:30:27,641
and then in Polish,

334
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:32,368
polish is kind of be interesting. It's cool fruit lot And

335
00:30:32,745 --> 00:30:35,120
I I think here the translator

336
00:30:35,657 --> 00:30:39,005
may been gone for a kind of a pun because,

337
00:30:39,622 --> 00:30:41,839
well, the primary meaning of this

338
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:43,236
study would be

339
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:52,296
ball among the ice But yeah, you can also also understand it as the wall among the ice cream because the the same words polish.

340
00:30:52,856 --> 00:31:02,664
Loading means size I in in in the plural or ice cream. I'm I'm I'm not quite sure if if if it's meant to be a pan but but at least has that.

341
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:22,622
Right. Well it works. I I like it when they kinda get get something they go a little bit of an extra mile in in translation. A good translator will do that. You yourself are in translation. Right? Yes. Yeah. Although, you don't you don't do, like, fun comic book translation and you do the more technical stuff.

342
00:31:23,621 --> 00:31:25,999
Yeah. I I I haven't done any

343
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:30,408
session. It's it's mainly taking look up for also some sub for

344
00:31:32,901 --> 00:31:34,997
something I've done in the past and then

345
00:31:35,654 --> 00:31:35,694
okay.

346
00:31:36,492 --> 00:31:47,835
Excellent. Thank you guys. Let's go ahead and talk about this this excellent story. So this story opens up with kind of a classic trope. Right? The character

347
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:49,509
unexpectedly

348
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:51,143
happening

349
00:31:51,758 --> 00:31:52,896
on an auction.

350
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:57,980
We we saw this Ryan in tear of the river, it opens with Donald Wandering

351
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,669
into an auction. And that much older Barks story

352
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:14,761
but this is a Scrooge story. And right away, we see that this auction is a big deal because as he gets in he sees that it's attended by bankers and ty cones from all over the world,

353
00:32:15,217 --> 00:32:17,788
and they all look very serious

354
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,839
And and the auction Huey,, you know, he brings in the consignment

355
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:31,147
with with kind of a lot of Sarah. Right? We can see... Ryan, do you wanna tell us about the consignment itself and how it's brought in? Well,

356
00:32:32,225 --> 00:32:32,725
there's

357
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,215
some armed guards with rifles

358
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,449
bringing in a block of ice

359
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:50,365
with a strange orange ball inside. Yeah It's suspended the ice clear so you can see the the orange bowl is suspended inside. Right. And and and the neat trick here is that Scrooge has no idea what it is.

360
00:32:51,458 --> 00:33:03,386
Nor does the reader, but everyone else there clearly does and is excited about it. So it's a really good way to build suspense. And scratch is just pla commenting that it looks like She as the auction year,

361
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:05,857
you know, starts to explain

362
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:21,237
that the ball is a compressed wall of the rarest element known to man. And Barb does actually make make a point of calling out the color is reddish. He doesn't usually... You know, he's never responsible, Ryan for the coloring.

363
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:25,437
So it's it's important that he mentions it here so that the colors

364
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:28,028
will actually keep consistent

365
00:33:28,444 --> 00:33:29,321
on this one. Yeah.

366
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:30,573
Makeup?

367
00:33:31,012 --> 00:33:32,071
Yes. I I

368
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:37,320
I I hadn't know before that for reddish. I mean, that also be a cold war coke. Yeah.

369
00:33:39,036 --> 00:33:39,829
Red. But

370
00:33:40,606 --> 00:33:43,975
platform from exactly that it's kind of comic that they they this

371
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:48,014
global advised that that's already melting there on the on the

372
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,851
cable. We right. Raven

373
00:33:51,310 --> 00:34:02,264
see the streets streams of water pouring off the sides. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's... It it wasn't like had read the whole story and read it again that I caught the full shadowing of. It looks like She. Yeah.

374
00:34:03,102 --> 00:34:03,602
Exactly.

375
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:12,107
Gonna end up being a good little book ended element. I guess it's worth noting too that it comes from the minds of the belgian

376
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:12,919
congo,

377
00:34:13,337 --> 00:34:17,149
which has kind of a a bloody and mysterious

378
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:19,902
history, I guess. So the the auction

379
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:31,589
itself starts, and and I think the auction seen is great because all these ty cones are super impatient to just get on with it It's clear that there's like this desperate clam to bid on whatever

380
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:32,769
this thing is.

381
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:42,789
And and so Scrooge, basically while he's wondering about this, he gets tram by all these other desperate ty who start bidding

382
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,303
immediately in fantastic numbers.

383
00:34:45,920 --> 00:35:00,032
And there's this great panel where he's asking this random like other victim of the the stampede from under their feet just what is that stuff? And he gets you guys the explanation that is the world's known supply of bomb ba.

384
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:10,292
But the guy He doesn't know. Tell us Ryan, what what's the only thing that this anonymous sky knows about it. It has to be kept frozen or it will evaporate

385
00:35:10,684 --> 00:35:23,246
on its own. Right. So so we're setting that up this important detail while the auction is going on, And and we're really only meant to focus on two of the auction...

386
00:35:23,584 --> 00:35:25,100
The the participants. Right?

387
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:30,649
They're they're clearly the only serious ones. They, do you wanna tell us about those two

388
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:31,428
participants?

389
00:35:32,107 --> 00:35:34,125
Yes. Well, one of them is the

390
00:35:35,874 --> 00:35:43,311
And ambassador or or... A representative. I. Yes. Yes. And the other one is the

391
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,524
director of

392
00:35:45,462 --> 00:35:46,482
general kudos,

393
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,437
which I I presume this Al is a on on

394
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:59,222
general motors. Right? Right. Yeah. Yeah. So the these two men are immediately like, they're they're both desperate. They're sc Al each other.

395
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:01,840
We can tell they're the only serious

396
00:36:02,274 --> 00:36:05,327
bidder pretty quickly because they bid it up to

397
00:36:05,824 --> 00:36:07,002
two hundred million

398
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:12,207
and then three Al bill excuse me. Two hundred billion and three hundred billion

399
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:13,445
respectively.

400
00:36:15,262 --> 00:36:16,921
We get this great panel

401
00:36:17,354 --> 00:36:18,510
of Scrooge

402
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:26,925
pondering. Ryan do you wanna to read his bit of dialogue on the bottom of page too. Says fan my feathers. If the stuff is that good, perhaps I should buy it.

403
00:36:27,658 --> 00:36:28,837
I I love it.

404
00:36:29,335 --> 00:36:40,744
And he leaves up and he says general scooters can't put my scooter factory out of business, and that known for B top too. And he immediately jumps the bidding up to one trillion

405
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:43,296
dollars. But you guys think of his

406
00:36:43,673 --> 00:36:46,425
his reckless bid there? It did seem a little loud of Character.

407
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:52,679
The the one later on where he where he raises the man by one sink seems more character.

408
00:36:53,255 --> 00:37:01,915
Right. Just a few paddle away. But... Yeah. But it it's you would think you would go, oh, it's three hundred billion and one cent. Seems seems the difficult screw Ducktales

409
00:37:02,409 --> 00:37:24,289
Yeah. Sc usually has the patience to do that, but but the purpose, the point it's important for Barks. Right? That Scrooge is gonna really over extend himself so that he feels really desperate for the rest of this story, because that's a big element of the story his desperation that his regret. And Ryan, you mentioned the kitchen sink bit. That this is one of the famous

410
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:27,002
elements of this story, the funny gag

411
00:37:27,354 --> 00:37:33,271
I love it. Screws bid knocks the general scooters guy out, but the Utopian

412
00:37:33,648 --> 00:37:34,148
representative

413
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,460
says that he's not through.

414
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,660
My country B top,

415
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:45,014
bids one trillion dollars and all of the kitchen syncs of its happy people.

416
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:50,327
And and when Scrooge inquire how many that is, the representative

417
00:37:50,706 --> 00:37:52,220
tells him five.

418
00:37:52,760 --> 00:38:04,283
And so of course, he does the predictable and... And yet still to me hilarious thing. Of bidding one trillion dollars and six kitchen, sinks. I love this seems so much you guys.

419
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:12,650
It is it is fantastic. Yeah. And yeah. At we should keep in mind that this is back in the fifties when a trillion dollars was a lot of money.

420
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:26,285
Yeah. Yeah We didn't have anyone who could realistically claim to be racing as they are right now to become the world's first trillion. Right. Right. Well the other with the kind of sums that bar usually

421
00:38:26,822 --> 00:38:27,641
has a,

422
00:38:28,178 --> 00:38:32,227
you know, pro claim. It's it's kind of surprising that he... Yeah To get almost closer

423
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,583
bankrupt after

424
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,915
this wondering.

425
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,275
You you would think that that that's

426
00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:39,555
money for for transcription.

427
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:50,550
This story ends up causing... It's it's a common question for Barks fans of, like, it's one of those ridiculous back of the napkin things of trying to think about how much money does Scrooge

428
00:38:51,045 --> 00:39:03,080
actually have, and it's a fool game. Right? Because number one, that's not the point of any of these stories. Number two, Barks has, like, ten to twenty stories where he'll name a different amount every time.

429
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:16,028
But but it's still kind of something that people like to about. But this one really makes it difficult because you can see how much it diminishes this fortune by. I like to imagine that's just his, like, kind of his

430
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:20,133
nostalgic money. It doesn't count for his treasures and

431
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,463
etcetera. But anyway, Scrooge

432
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:26,615
he escalate the bid and he does win it.

433
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:34,383
I I love the auction here. Do you mind reading that dialogue Ryan? Sold to the little Ducktales the many sinks and the big bank rule.

434
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:37,176
And of course get

435
00:39:37,554 --> 00:39:38,870
introduction if you don't have enough sinks.

436
00:39:39,804 --> 00:39:40,304
Just

437
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:42,142
the old knowledge. And

438
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:59,615
I would be remiss if I didn't mention the old saying. Right? This is, like, This is the... Everything, but the kitchen sink. So the the the B has bid the entire value of his country and its kitchen sink. That's a a famous idiom in English.

439
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:00,195
Yes.

440
00:40:01,275 --> 00:40:04,895
I don't I don't know if he if it's because of of that idiom, but

441
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:08,307
this one that I been remember being translated

442
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:13,793
a bit differently in the in the finish edition. Yeah. Curious.

443
00:40:14,928 --> 00:40:15,667
They're the

444
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:17,281
Ducktales,

445
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:18,978
he will

446
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:25,390
bit one three dollars and all the color television sets of these happy people and

447
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,550
out that

448
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:27,830
we have

449
00:40:28,185 --> 00:40:28,685
five.

450
00:40:30,223 --> 00:40:37,270
Nice. That seems like a good substitution if you don't have that that specific that very particular idiom Yeah. Yeah.

451
00:40:38,388 --> 00:40:50,564
Alright. So when Scrooge wins it, of course, now he's gotta figure out what you actually do with that. The general scooters guy hope that it power his factories for all eternity, but he is

452
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:53,316
dismay to find out that nobody

453
00:40:53,773 --> 00:40:56,880
knows it's just this very rare element

454
00:40:57,379 --> 00:40:59,197
that everyone supposed

455
00:40:59,776 --> 00:41:02,314
must have a lot of power in its adams

456
00:41:03,012 --> 00:41:08,122
But Scrooge, you know, he... He's a set he says he's been took. And the next

457
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:12,437
the next page is basically about screws buyer's

458
00:41:12,776 --> 00:41:13,095
remorse.

459
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:21,210
We see him... We see him lock it away in in his very nineteen fifties ice box and we see him watching

460
00:41:22,205 --> 00:41:29,258
This Con v of armor trucks hauling out Tell us about the specifics ryan of the Con envoy.

461
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,830
Well, we just see a a con of armored

462
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:41,917
trucks, you can see the rivets in the sides. They're all named Blink Money express and for days, truckload of of money are moving out of his money been

463
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:49,548
ten truck loads Severino day for ten weeks. So again, we could kind of calculate it if we were that kind of obsessive nerd.

464
00:41:50,527 --> 00:41:53,184
But but I mean, the point of we are. Right?

465
00:41:54,922 --> 00:41:56,600
I'm not quite that caliber.

466
00:41:57,255 --> 00:42:24,462
But I know that people have done done the math before But but the point of this is to make Scrooge watch. Right, and and despair. Mh I suspect too that these trucks are kind of like blinking it's gone. Is is what it's supposed to evo there. Yeah. We see him looking at the seventy foot mark on his money gauge, which is usually at the ninety nine foot mark. And and you know, you really feel for the

467
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,460
the me

468
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:27,354
trillion error there.

469
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:39,290
I didn't know Huey, usually at the ninety nine foot mark. Yeah. I I didn't know what the what the what the comparison scale was there. I do see the crane in the background where he that he uses just scoop

470
00:42:39,668 --> 00:42:40,465
scoop money out.

471
00:42:41,263 --> 00:42:46,030
But, yeah, that would apply. You should have probably a little over two twilio left in there if it's all

472
00:42:46,487 --> 00:42:46,987
fairly

473
00:42:48,122 --> 00:42:48,622
much

474
00:42:49,255 --> 00:42:49,755
Exactly.

475
00:42:50,454 --> 00:43:03,502
Exactly. This is why this, like throws such a monkey wrench into people's efforts to to into nerds efforts to calculate it. So at this point in the story, Barks is gonna bring in Donald and the nephews

476
00:43:04,397 --> 00:43:11,412
to get another percent of. And they just... They wanna see the bomb ba. It's it's clearly become a famous

477
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:13,007
thing in the papers.

478
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:14,560
And when Scrooge

479
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:18,421
screws opens the fridge, they see an ominous

480
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,380
trail

481
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,340
of

482
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,701
the puddle pooling of water

483
00:43:23,135 --> 00:43:24,315
showing that it's melted.

484
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:27,671
There there is still a crust of ice

485
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:31,846
around it, but but the ice block is nearly melted Scrooge just horror.

486
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,233
Because apparently, the motor has stopped

487
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:41,869
they do you wanna tell us about why the motor is stopped? Yes. So in the next panel

488
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:51,860
sc, I I remember now, I got in a hassle with the electric company about my bill and they've turned the power off. This is one of those classic bark bits where he

489
00:43:52,441 --> 00:43:55,461
he's gonna show Scrooge just like penny pinching

490
00:43:55,761 --> 00:44:16,634
causing him. These these kinds of problems. It's very funny. To make And this next sequence is one of the most slaps that Barks has done in an in a while file, I think this sequence is great. Your mileage may vary, but but basically, the whole the whole span is devoted to the docks taking that

491
00:44:17,053 --> 00:44:18,112
rapidly melting

492
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,710
ball of bombastic

493
00:44:20,288 --> 00:44:40,838
to a special freezer plant And you guys, I'm not gonna go through every chronic beat of this sequence, but do either of you have a favorite moment from this, like slaps part I could tell... I could tell where it was going as soon as they dropped it down the stairs and it bounces off the stairs and then rolls up a a wooden plank, who knows why the wooden plank is in there.

494
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:50,390
But it rolls up the wooden plank up to a a, like, a drum of hot tar that's being fired up right now to to work on the street to make asphalt.

495
00:44:50,885 --> 00:44:56,826
And I was like, okay. It's time to Ducktales in. We're gonna. We're gonna see how how crazy we can take this and

496
00:44:57,126 --> 00:45:04,996
he he came up with some pretty good pretty good good. Probably the one that should be mentioned is that when it goes into the hot springs, you know, Scrooge

497
00:45:05,713 --> 00:45:06,351
it down,

498
00:45:07,244 --> 00:45:08,940
down, like, into a ge

499
00:45:09,437 --> 00:45:09,915
spout,

500
00:45:10,713 --> 00:45:16,376
and and as Donald warned him you'll be drenched. He says who cares about a little dr.

501
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,825
I caught it, and that's gonna be a repeated element later in the story.

502
00:45:21,784 --> 00:45:29,475
It's it's wonderful. It's slaps stick, so I won't you know, we can't talk too much about it because it's very visual. But ultimately the Inducks,

503
00:45:30,116 --> 00:45:35,466
they do make it with a very thin crust device to the freezer plant.

504
00:45:36,082 --> 00:45:40,804
Aren't aren't guys boiling hot. I mean, wouldn't he surely have been killed?

505
00:45:41,593 --> 00:45:42,093
Spinning

506
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:48,868
right in the middle of... Okay. I think they can vary in in house scouting. They are or aren't

507
00:45:49,221 --> 00:45:53,661
Okay. But but... Yeah. I'm... I would just be glad it's not my trillion dollars.

508
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:55,560
Yeah. That's true.

509
00:45:56,675 --> 00:46:00,495
One thing we'll never have to worry about until this podcast really takes off.

510
00:46:01,035 --> 00:46:02,755
That's alright. Mh. That's right.

511
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:04,269
This

512
00:46:04,608 --> 00:46:07,945
episode sponsored by the Leaky Kona ice cream company.

513
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:10,921
So next Barks

514
00:46:11,454 --> 00:46:18,335
pulls it out, kinda kinda literally. Right? He pulls back as the duct kind of pond or what else could go wrong

515
00:46:18,673 --> 00:46:19,332
for this

516
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,808
ball of ice

517
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:22,961
and and they realized that, you know,

518
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:24,780
what if lightning

519
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:26,681
struck and Ducktales

520
00:46:26,721 --> 00:46:29,360
had a a black had a power outage.

521
00:46:30,056 --> 00:46:39,450
Sp is just escalating the word and the dread for screws at this point. And I think any of us could problem solve, you know, bad up generators,

522
00:46:41,188 --> 00:46:42,287
blah blah blah.

523
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:48,415
It it's easy enough to be like, alright. You know, for a million bucks a year, I can be certain

524
00:46:48,793 --> 00:46:53,724
that I can keep this safe. But but for the point of the comment, it makes sense

525
00:46:54,901 --> 00:46:56,558
what the boys

526
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:06,055
proposed as the solution. They, you wanna tell us about the proposed solution here? Yes. So of course, the nephews so their

527
00:47:06,394 --> 00:47:07,193
junior Inducks

528
00:47:07,713 --> 00:47:15,020
checks guide book, and they read that the first subscription says, what am I going to do three dollar wall of Boom

529
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:27,056
could note anywhere. And then Huey, or where this says oh, no. It couldn't. According to the junior Wood guide book there is a place where it would stay frozen forever the great ice mountains

530
00:47:27,395 --> 00:47:30,490
around the south pole and the after dot Scrooge

531
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:33,246
boys. We're going to the south pole.

532
00:47:33,925 --> 00:47:37,381
He's he's pretty hasty there. Even that his

533
00:47:37,935 --> 00:47:41,036
is is a nice character beat. Right? Because

534
00:47:41,415 --> 00:47:49,211
Donald is like, Huey,, hold your horses. You don't just buy a ticket. You know, this is obviously an expedition. But I really like the panel.

535
00:47:49,671 --> 00:47:53,350
At the bottom of this page gentlemen, where where Scrooge says,

536
00:47:53,830 --> 00:48:05,358
don't blame me if I don't think of those Angles boys, I've been a in a state of shock ever since I saw my trillion dollars, go over the hill. That's a really nice character moment. Right? Because

537
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:14,190
it invest this sense of, like, the spare and disappointment Inducks screws and it's gonna go a long way towards explaining some of the, like,

538
00:48:15,004 --> 00:48:15,504
un

539
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:24,437
bad decisions that he's making throughout this story. So the next sequence really is all about the preparations for the journey

540
00:48:25,229 --> 00:48:28,985
There's nothing too interesting about it except we do get to watch Scrooge

541
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:30,443
despair

542
00:48:30,902 --> 00:48:32,161
as his scientists

543
00:48:33,471 --> 00:48:38,552
grind out like a little... I don't know like, a thumbnail. What's a good comparison

544
00:48:39,247 --> 00:48:39,720
for that

545
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:43,110
that amount, like a Him worth

546
00:48:43,886 --> 00:48:48,333
yeah. Of the bombastic to do, like, to do further testing

547
00:48:49,605 --> 00:48:52,925
Ryan, did you notice the random little background gag at the top right?

548
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:55,925
One of Barks random background art.

549
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,860
Is it his curtains that have dollar sons on them? They're green buttons?

550
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:10,505
I wasn't even noticing that, but that's in fun one too. I just noticing the picture that's just z fast buck. Yeah. With the a coin that has legs and it's clearly running very quickly,

551
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:12,576
Right. Just one of those little

552
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:13,453
surreal

553
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:15,048
background elements.

554
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:23,605
But, yeah, the scientists are gonna be running experiments while they're on the x expedition. And and so we see them launch

555
00:49:24,105 --> 00:49:31,309
from a a vessel that's pretty well out for. It's an ice it's an x navy ice break or a some nice detail.

556
00:49:32,466 --> 00:49:37,313
But Scrooge towels tells the docks in a great bit of fore foreshadowing.

557
00:49:37,785 --> 00:49:54,050
He says, Ryan, do you wanna read what he says the bottom on the page there? It's not the ship nor the crew that worries me now Donald. It's that B utopian guy. He said he'd see me again, and I'm beginning to wonder when. Yeah. If not as reader had completely forgotten about him, and I don't think we'll be seeing him anymore.

558
00:49:55,825 --> 00:50:12,345
And and whether you did or didn't, it's a it's a good little reminder. And and you know, it's thing to me as we continue on the journey, as we embark on the journey, the tone is, like, boredom. Right? We're gonna we're gonna transition now to the Nephews

559
00:50:12,725 --> 00:50:15,625
point of view. This is obviously a long journey

560
00:50:16,365 --> 00:50:19,345
It is the first time that Barks has set an adventure

561
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,118
or any story as far as I know in

562
00:50:22,457 --> 00:50:24,755
any hard, so this is exciting.

563
00:50:25,174 --> 00:50:31,325
But but the nephews are so bored that they're not even interested did in the whales that are, like fro

564
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:36,805
all around the ice breaker. And you know, they're despair that they don't have

565
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,900
any game aboard

566
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,340
to play with.

567
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,300
And and so they make a decision

568
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:50,901
to play a frank. I really like the element of the story. It's very whim, but it feels it feels

569
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:51,779
very

570
00:50:52,556 --> 00:51:01,327
natural. The way Barks is introduced to. Vehicle, do you wanna tell us about the prank that they're gonna play? Yes. So they're going to gonna make Al another

571
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:02,324
ball

572
00:51:03,514 --> 00:51:05,253
that resembles the

573
00:51:05,592 --> 00:51:06,092
well...

574
00:51:06,911 --> 00:51:14,254
Well, they say that they they can freeze Al block of colored eyes and have the wall from it that that they have some flavoring

575
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,762
to it to to give color. They they start with

576
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:22,885
strawberry flavoring then put some orange extract to tow it down and

577
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:24,205
some

578
00:51:24,545 --> 00:51:25,365
to to give

579
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:26,285
etcetera

580
00:51:26,745 --> 00:51:31,853
and so on. And and and then then finally, they come up with it with this school that that that that's

581
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:38,611
exactly the same shape for. Right. I I like this because it really feels like the kind of thing that, like,

582
00:51:39,345 --> 00:51:46,005
I would have done as a kid where I like to just randomly them like kinda mix flavors and stuff together. But Having think its neat,

583
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:57,573
and we haven't seen too much of the nephews in the story so far. So, you know, once they have this matching block of ice, they talk about how they're gonna

584
00:51:59,151 --> 00:52:00,909
use it to print Gun Scrooge.

585
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:11,413
What do you think, Ryan? Also, I I I was just thinking as they're as they're talking their way through of how to make it look right. This is another kind of instructions to the color.

586
00:52:11,792 --> 00:52:11,872
Yeah.

587
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,945
Almost like color going

588
00:52:14,524 --> 00:52:17,781
Nope. That's to red. I need to put a little orange in there to tone it down.

589
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:24,069
Yeah. This is one of the very few stories where every coloring of it should technically

590
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:32,440
Al least this element of the story. Every coloring should look pretty much the same. You know, I recently got to release land beneath the grounds.

591
00:52:32,814 --> 00:52:42,225
Which is like a real landmark Scrooge story, one of his most famous ones and the creatures in that are like these rock ball creatures, the cherries and the Fermi.

592
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:43,099
And

593
00:52:43,436 --> 00:52:44,176
it just

594
00:52:44,513 --> 00:52:45,691
varies widely

595
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:49,161
whether the call made them, like, super colorful,

596
00:52:49,937 --> 00:52:52,130
made them look like actual rocks.

597
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:56,005
So it's it's interesting to see what where he's like

598
00:52:56,385 --> 00:53:00,285
okay. Color really matters here. So we're gonna we're gonna actually

599
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:04,713
name it, even even even bolts the... That's too red.

600
00:53:05,472 --> 00:53:06,970
Well burn some orange

601
00:53:07,348 --> 00:53:22,070
extract. I guess, technically, the album that I'm looking at right now yes. It's orange, kind of Al orange just brown, to be honest. So... So, anyway, they're debating what they're gonna do with the ice or they're just gonna play catch with it, roll it back and forth

602
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:26,830
when all of a sudden, their thoughts are interrupted

603
00:53:27,223 --> 00:53:30,432
by a quote, large black something.

604
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:31,667
Surfacing

605
00:53:32,203 --> 00:53:39,491
off of their star. And so here, this is where Barks is gonna bring back that Utopian

606
00:53:40,107 --> 00:53:40,607
threat

607
00:53:41,023 --> 00:53:41,975
because we've got

608
00:53:42,473 --> 00:53:51,205
Ryan, you wanna tell us about what we've got. At first, it looks almost exactly like the the sperm whales that have been, like, leap out of the water and incredibly dramatic ways.

609
00:53:51,779 --> 00:53:54,273
Right. Around the ship for the this whole journey.

610
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:58,555
But then it then it has a tower and a gun on the top, and it's

611
00:53:59,415 --> 00:54:01,195
clear that it's a a submarine

612
00:54:01,615 --> 00:54:02,735
Al attack submarine.

613
00:54:03,415 --> 00:54:03,495
Right.

614
00:54:04,415 --> 00:54:07,495
And screws recognizes the the flag as his old friend.

615
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:13,170
Yeah. The black course the, of course as we see on the bottom just has a knife. It's just a

616
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:15,130
a big un knife.

617
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:21,627
Right Right, yeah. I was wondering what you guys think about, You know, it's not a hammer and simple.

618
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:25,450
Yeah. Although although I think I think that in in one of the later

619
00:54:25,868 --> 00:54:28,322
resolved stories. Barks does have this

620
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,436
flag that it kind of look like the

621
00:54:30,773 --> 00:54:36,632
Am and Sequel. Yeah. But but I I I did Huey, here give be that. Too much because

622
00:54:37,648 --> 00:54:38,347
already has.

623
00:54:38,684 --> 00:54:46,778
Has so many much of these called wardrobe workshops here. Right. It's some pretty clear It's some pretty clear signaling they are a threat.

624
00:54:47,156 --> 00:54:49,551
And, of course, and nephews are very excited. Yes.

625
00:54:50,469 --> 00:54:52,286
Because they are bored out of their right.

626
00:54:52,664 --> 00:55:04,010
Yeah. Tell us about Ryan what they do in their excitement. They... Instead of playing with the ice ball as part of their print, they just put it in the freezer with the real one right next to it and the two of them appear identical to my ass

627
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:09,836
which I think is an important part of the plot here. And then they run out onto the deck saying. Oh, boy oh boy boy.

628
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:11,610
Right.

629
00:55:12,503 --> 00:55:22,399
And and so we do indeed see the b top now dressed up and kind of some like military ga. Coming out of the submarine

630
00:55:23,058 --> 00:55:27,274
and say, I I love his line here. He says my country, B top,

631
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:29,012
bids you greetings,

632
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:38,575
rich, pay dot or, you know, dog of Inducks depending on what you're looking at. I'm gotta say dog of the Ducktales doesn't work too badly.

633
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:41,730
As far as changes, they both sound like pe,

634
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:43,730
dog of a doc

635
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:56,224
is, you know, little at least. So... Right. So that works okay. And and, you know, there's no there's no time wasted. Va didn't... Did it strike you then in other stories

636
00:55:56,659 --> 00:56:00,056
Sk would have made some efforts to hide the ball. Right?

637
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:04,192
Yeah. Probably, probably. I mean, yeah you're right there.

638
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:05,445
There's no no

639
00:56:06,422 --> 00:56:24,627
generally in this in the store. It's it's very fast moving and and... Yeah. That's it That's kind of one of the things I I like about yeah. I agree. And I think the the reason Barks is able to do this to kinda gloss over Scrooge just efforts at, like, safeguard regarding it is is because he's so broken

640
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:28,018
from that, you know, earlier experience.

641
00:56:28,556 --> 00:56:38,000
Right. And the timing is so important in this next sequence here. Right Barks does such a nice job of of Scrooge

642
00:56:39,134 --> 00:56:40,273
The the

643
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:48,455
the representative gives... Does Al literal shake down. Right? He grabs him and by by his coat. And tells him what

644
00:56:49,412 --> 00:56:51,468
Wants B top takes.

645
00:56:51,964 --> 00:56:54,099
You're giving me that bombastic.

646
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:55,872
And so Scrooge

647
00:56:56,231 --> 00:57:00,625
Barks to the freezer, and he's just crying and despair

648
00:57:01,005 --> 00:57:02,905
as he's gonna grab the ball

649
00:57:03,445 --> 00:57:08,359
and And you know, it's only him approaching the freezer. One of the nephews

650
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:14,527
wants to offer. He makes used to get it, but the B hope pulls him back. And by the time

651
00:57:14,905 --> 00:57:16,083
he approaches

652
00:57:16,581 --> 00:57:28,240
the the freezer with the airs sa ball. He's so blinded by tears that he doesn't notice that there are two of them. But do you guys think of that perspective shot, you know, where the reader sees him?

653
00:57:28,893 --> 00:57:30,588
I think it's pretty cool. Yeah. It's...

654
00:57:31,403 --> 00:57:34,134
Especially if, you know, if you're really really wee

655
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:35,249
like he

656
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:43,770
things might appear double anyway. Like, he he probably doesn't even seem suspicious. Right. Yeah. I... I really like how this is staged.

657
00:57:45,364 --> 00:57:54,158
And the whole time, the reader is like, really tense and wondering, you know, are we gonna get... Are we gonna give him the real ball or not is he gonna notice.

658
00:57:54,934 --> 00:58:25,869
And I like the... I like the quick thinking nephews. I like that Hue has already like done all the math, and he's like, no. No. I can I can fix this problem? I know exactly what to do for this. Yeah. And and it's Al that's a good point too because Barks trust says readers enough not to give us a panel where they're like confirming with each other though hey, if you if we can convince him, then maybe he can take the wrong one. We just... We just know. Yeah. We're also clever little boy they know. We're all clever little boys together with you we do Louis.

659
00:58:26,326 --> 00:58:27,663
Yes. That's right.

660
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:38,415
So the the next part It's it's very predictable. Right? We know it's gonna happen. The nephews are gonna reveal that there's still a ball, but Barks,

661
00:58:38,989 --> 00:58:43,264
He un roles it. He lays it out in a in a very neat way.

662
00:58:44,143 --> 00:58:44,803
The nephews

663
00:58:45,462 --> 00:58:49,092
show him once the route left look So the nephews

664
00:58:49,508 --> 00:58:59,335
are they're kind of like caution him. They're telling him basically, we we did this joke we don't know if this is real bomb ba or not.

665
00:59:00,214 --> 00:59:14,507
And there's this really tense moment where they are staring at it and they decide that the only way to figure it out is by giving it a look and seeing if it tastes like any of those flavoring agents that they use and unfortunately,

666
00:59:15,005 --> 00:59:19,657
the first nephew gives it a lick and says, oh, I taste strawberry.

667
00:59:20,274 --> 00:59:23,424
And then the next nephew tries it again and says,

668
00:59:23,843 --> 00:59:25,901
I taste orange and

669
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,140
Vanilla,

670
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:46,016
and and then they just spare that it it would be the ice ball and they in frustration they get ready to throw throw it into the ocean. And and then at that moment, Donald decides that he needs to have a taste of something sweet after the days bad luck, and he

671
00:59:46,593 --> 00:59:48,927
detects a taste of peppermint.

672
00:59:51,076 --> 00:59:55,387
And and as the nephews are puzzled because they didn't put in any peppermint,

673
00:59:55,906 --> 00:59:58,980
Scrooge gets ready to chuck it into the ocean.

674
00:59:59,593 --> 01:00:01,926
And just before he does,

675
01:00:02,302 --> 01:00:04,236
he sees that tell

676
01:00:04,652 --> 01:00:06,308
little dent where the scientist

677
01:00:07,098 --> 01:00:09,551
Scrooge out all that testing material.

678
01:00:09,888 --> 01:00:17,122
And real... And they realized they've got this... The ball of ba still safe and and with them on board.

679
01:00:17,761 --> 01:00:23,195
I I love that sequence you guys. I think it's... I think it's great. I think it's a wonderful payoff.

680
01:00:24,247 --> 01:00:28,297
Any thoughts they go? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's it's it's great great

681
01:00:28,714 --> 01:00:29,573
sequence really.

682
01:00:31,283 --> 01:00:32,301
Click hang moment

683
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,812
because the panel wear Scrooge notice the

684
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:37,969
notice that

685
01:00:39,066 --> 01:00:39,779
the very

686
01:00:40,479 --> 01:00:44,659
of and end of page, and we're not sure if you if you actually

687
01:00:44,999 --> 01:00:46,099
we'll throw it. But,

688
01:00:47,213 --> 01:00:48,331
Of course, it doesn't want he.

689
01:00:49,089 --> 01:00:50,028
Realizes that it's

690
01:00:50,486 --> 01:00:53,221
sebastian. And I almost threw it overboard And

691
01:00:53,598 --> 01:01:21,123
Yeah. It's here. That's this out. It's very well time with, like, the architecture of the Com page. Any comments, ryan? It it also does seem a little unscrew. Yeah. I think I think it depends on him being just just at the end of his rope and he's been completely emotionally burned out by this whole experience and... Because I think I think your usual screwed your clever Scrooge would have he would gotten tested. And then maybe even if it is just she, maybe still try and sell it as bombastic and

692
01:01:21,462 --> 01:01:22,581
recoup some of that money, you know?

693
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,599
Right. Pretty convincing looking.

694
01:01:26,178 --> 01:01:31,845
I guess, it's worth noting too that we've got a little bit of cartoon logic here where they can, like, kinda taste

695
01:01:32,781 --> 01:01:33,281
different

696
01:01:33,859 --> 01:01:34,877
distinct flavors.

697
01:01:36,053 --> 01:01:43,724
But but, you know, that's fine. I I also really like where the sequence continues on the next page as they all kinda take turns

698
01:01:44,104 --> 01:01:47,699
licking at again and and they they alternate

699
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:48,819
from the different...

700
01:01:49,159 --> 01:01:52,759
Ryan, do you wanna tell us the different flavors they alternate through rapid fire.

701
01:01:53,479 --> 01:01:58,154
We get Banana peach, cherry, winter green, gu chocolate, tamarind,

702
01:01:58,734 --> 01:02:00,274
lime, butters scotch.

703
01:02:01,534 --> 01:02:02,554
And like there's

704
01:02:03,414 --> 01:02:11,241
enough to recognize Tamarind. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe they... Maybe that's one of their favorite favorite treats. Right. And this this

705
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:14,094
this waste full licking

706
01:02:14,434 --> 01:02:16,514
is enough to revive Scrooge

707
01:02:17,114 --> 01:02:25,141
because as he says, you letters slip up a million dollars worth of mom ba them. Every time you lick a flavor

708
01:02:25,518 --> 01:02:26,536
and he sn

709
01:02:26,992 --> 01:02:30,499
And and just at that moment, Vac, you wanna tell us what happens?

710
01:02:31,034 --> 01:02:37,214
Yeah. So we we have the sound of it bump and and see that something has bumped into the boat

711
01:02:37,794 --> 01:02:44,997
group christ. What now and we see the... Well as chrome Barks and it's it's a way the has come.

712
01:02:45,716 --> 01:02:49,029
Come up under the sheet. And they they got the one best.

713
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:58,565
Something. That way. Yeah. Why don't you tell us about the the the sequence this quick little whale sequence. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's is it's one of the most

714
01:02:59,158 --> 01:03:01,650
exciting sequences in this story. So

715
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:03,980
so, of course, Scrooge

716
01:03:04,737 --> 01:03:05,237
immediately

717
01:03:05,574 --> 01:03:10,517
jumps our board on the whale and it's chasing this telephone

718
01:03:10,896 --> 01:03:20,809
and it goes down way from this old the that wells on on their back, but I don't know what's Oh, english. It's it's a blow hole. Global. Right. Right. This is...

719
01:03:21,447 --> 01:03:24,980
Went in there and the nephews or or maybe donald is

720
01:03:25,453 --> 01:03:30,948
crying get back and goes screw get back, he'll be drenched. But what happens is that the whale

721
01:03:31,727 --> 01:03:33,626
blows the the the wall... The

722
01:03:34,124 --> 01:03:34,759
back with

723
01:03:35,418 --> 01:03:36,557
ro and and then

724
01:03:37,136 --> 01:03:45,481
Scrooge replace this line. Barks Al about a little french. I called it. It's it's a very goofy few little slaps stick bit, but but it works for the repetition.

725
01:03:45,978 --> 01:03:48,192
And I love that panel of him

726
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:51,979
expanding the length of the whale in pursuit of the Mom.

727
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,989
When Disney, when Disney finally gets around to making the live action

728
01:03:57,289 --> 01:04:04,444
movies of all of these comics, this is gonna be the the key action set piece of this this feature. Yeah. That'll will be a real show.

729
01:04:05,104 --> 01:04:12,059
So let's see. We're pretty or pretty far into the story at this point you guys, and we have just arrived

730
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:13,779
to an antarctica.

731
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:23,541
The last continent that the du have not have yet to to explorer of yet to be on in the Barks stories. And being an antarctica,

732
01:04:24,038 --> 01:04:25,734
there's not too much interesting

733
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:27,766
about the the continent

734
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:31,852
from a a comment book artist perspective. So

735
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:43,193
so he... He's gonna really do what he can with this part of the story art wise, you know? But but I think most of the the interest of the rest of the story is gonna lie in

736
01:04:43,769 --> 01:04:49,790
in who he meets there. We're gonna encounter and antarctica most famous inhabitants, the penguins.

737
01:04:50,488 --> 01:04:53,801
I do like the panel of seeing the ice breaker at work, you know,

738
01:04:55,614 --> 01:05:04,354
tearing through the the ice shelf there making their way in because they do still reference wanting to be hidden from the Utopian.

739
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:07,969
And the next part of the story, you know, it's pretty straightforward.

740
01:05:08,429 --> 01:05:11,989
Basically, they they need to walk inland towards those mountains.

741
01:05:12,524 --> 01:05:19,016
They need to... Where they're gonna bury the bomb ba and carefully documented it and

742
01:05:19,395 --> 01:05:23,309
and that's it. Then it doesn't... It's not gonna go as planned

743
01:05:23,609 --> 01:05:28,509
because as they land, they have... They have a fun little and encounter

744
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:29,829
with the penguin.

745
01:05:30,542 --> 01:05:32,638
Does one of you is one of you particularly?

746
01:05:33,015 --> 01:05:37,622
Yeah. Tell us the encounter. We we get them... The artist, you'll notice

747
01:05:38,399 --> 01:05:45,855
introduces them as we see the the bigger shot, the wide shot of the ice breaker cracking through the ice, you see the tiny penguins

748
01:05:46,312 --> 01:05:49,820
watching from a cliff. As comes in. And then

749
01:05:50,317 --> 01:05:52,973
as as our hike have all their

750
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:56,104
expedition gear and they're walking through the the ice and snow,

751
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:59,379
they come across kind of a line of penguins

752
01:05:59,959 --> 01:06:03,259
and the screws start speculating how he could make money from penguins.

753
01:06:04,479 --> 01:06:05,154
Then go to

754
01:06:05,573 --> 01:06:10,748
that the Bombastic must have rolled out of his Map act, and then he spots it being sat upon by

755
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,464
by one of one of the penguins

756
01:06:13,778 --> 01:06:21,104
And then and then for the rest of the issue, we are almost certainly mis gender this penguin because the male penguins are almost always the ones

757
01:06:21,642 --> 01:06:47,729
sitting on the eggs, especially an egg that they just encounter. So... But we call... We call... We call him a her the rest of the issue, which I thought was interesting. Yeah. That's a good point. I didn't I didn't catch that. I didn't think of that. You're right. It's the it's the female penguin generally that lays the eggs, then goes off to find food as the meal. Stays with the check. And I... And the egg is usually like, on their feet. It's it's it's a... It's only awesome. Is anyone... They do show like his stomach

758
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:57,864
feathers kind of going over the top of it like a real penguin would do though. So it's it's it's not exactly right, but it's in the right direction. Yeah. And I think the the penguins are all drawn

759
01:06:58,324 --> 01:07:05,197
very, like I'd say they're very realistic slash Huey,. You know, these these are not like cartoon pain they definitely

760
01:07:05,854 --> 01:07:16,700
evo Real Penguins like he was using one of his national geographic references or something. Yeah. And I I love the element of the the penguin in the story. I think it's very cute

761
01:07:17,397 --> 01:07:28,295
We see as as Scrooge recover the egg and says get off of that, you moon idle setting him. That's no egg as as he recovers the bomb bathroom.

762
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:42,147
We we see them walk off and she's got a thought balloon that is just, like, a little hard heartbreaking as she imagine. A little check emerging from from what he or she supposed

763
01:07:43,046 --> 01:07:44,843
is an... Is a Penguin.

764
01:07:45,523 --> 01:07:46,481
Any comments makeup?

765
01:07:47,161 --> 01:07:48,380
Yeah. Well, I I

766
01:07:48,734 --> 01:08:04,040
like ping in in in general. So so so this is definitely one of my sequences in this in this story. Yeah. I I think it's still delightful I like penguins as well. And Barb has a narrator box tell us the cold miles pass swiftly.

767
01:08:04,953 --> 01:08:06,791
And the docs are stuck in a blizzard,

768
01:08:07,231 --> 01:08:11,587
which, I guess, would be would be quite a surprise. Right? Because, like

769
01:08:12,306 --> 01:08:14,085
Famously is a whole desert

770
01:08:15,434 --> 01:08:21,251
So I wonder if it's a wind storm rather than a blizzard, but but that's just a little pedantic thing point out.

771
01:08:22,222 --> 01:08:24,518
That it's very rare that it actually

772
01:08:24,856 --> 01:08:26,832
snows there. But but rather

773
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:27,710
accumulated

774
01:08:28,087 --> 01:08:54,462
snow over millions of years. So the docs can't see each other the point of the sequence, and they kinda go down the line, making sure that everyone is still there. And when we get to the end of the line, Scrooge says, well, if I am behind all of you, who is this behind me. I'm sure enough. It is Va. Do you wanna read his... His bit of dialogue there? It's... That that the god happy ping win.

775
01:08:55,538 --> 01:08:56,038
Talk

776
01:08:56,574 --> 01:08:57,274
with the

777
01:08:58,169 --> 01:08:59,205
We're getting out of the again.

778
01:09:00,377 --> 01:09:02,952
She's very determined to get that egg.

779
01:09:03,769 --> 01:09:07,541
And and I really like this very funny panel of him

780
01:09:08,214 --> 01:09:08,714
doing

781
01:09:09,094 --> 01:09:16,034
as they laugh about how you've made a friend for life. She's gonna follow you to the south pole to get that quote egg

782
01:09:16,468 --> 01:09:22,393
And we get a great silhouette panel where he's saying I've never been so embarrassed in all of my life.

783
01:09:23,209 --> 01:09:28,803
Let's see Ryan, do you wanna tell us about the next sequence when they arrive at a likely spot to bury yet?

784
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,786
So they they find a spot on this slopes of the ice mountains

785
01:09:33,124 --> 01:09:34,223
of Antarctica.

786
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,829
And I I I assume it was chosen for being in the middle of nowhere.

787
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:39,743
And

788
01:09:40,044 --> 01:09:46,044
for never getting warm enough to melt anything. So they start kind of just digging a a hole in the ice.

789
01:09:46,976 --> 01:09:48,712
In the snow and

790
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:52,258
slowly lower it in while the penguin looks on

791
01:09:52,913 --> 01:09:53,909
with some distress.

792
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:55,884
Scrooge

793
01:09:56,324 --> 01:10:05,347
screw notes that he can't put a marker there to show where it's been hidden because then it wouldn't be hidden anymore. He just has to write down the precise latitude,

794
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,096
which he does in a notebook,

795
01:10:08,592 --> 01:10:15,211
and everybody's pushing Donald is pushing the the penguin back trying to explain to the penguin in English

796
01:10:16,108 --> 01:10:17,225
that this is not an egg.

797
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:21,155
It's it's just a a weird ball of some new elements. You know.

798
01:10:21,994 --> 01:10:23,752
For some reason, the penguin doesn't seem to understand.

799
01:10:24,951 --> 01:10:33,203
And the penguin one is for Lauren. And sits on the spot now that has been re varied, and they're concerned that the payment will try to dig it back up so they

800
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:38,389
put a leash on it and and start hauling it back as part of the the con v back to society.

801
01:10:39,149 --> 01:10:40,749
Right. Yeah. Exactly.

802
01:10:41,389 --> 01:10:42,889
I like seeing screws

803
01:10:43,244 --> 01:10:48,158
siding the the coordinates using an actual substance, always a nice touch.

804
01:10:48,718 --> 01:10:56,456
I really you gotta really feel for that penguin in the sea months. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Even in the last frame, he's he's walking off

805
01:10:56,793 --> 01:11:10,109
looking at his notebook. So pleased do himself and pulling the leash with the penguin. And the penguin is still looking back with an obviously very worried look on its face. Right. And she's supposed to very Al egg. And that's supposed to be an egg in the snow not a good thing to do.

806
01:11:10,448 --> 01:11:12,908
Yeah. Yeah. The penguin knows what's up.

807
01:11:13,729 --> 01:11:15,689
And and even into the next sequence,

808
01:11:16,262 --> 01:11:19,556
even into the next sequence, you know, she's there su

809
01:11:20,054 --> 01:11:21,432
as the Bra utopian

810
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:22,350
representative

811
01:11:22,887 --> 01:11:27,955
returns for the last time he's He's taken what I assume must be a pretty risky

812
01:11:28,374 --> 01:11:37,723
journey and helicopter down to the south pole, and he gets set out very angry saying my country B top bids you no greetings

813
01:11:38,223 --> 01:11:39,603
rich pick a dot

814
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:40,963
because

815
01:11:42,239 --> 01:12:02,453
Happy people are angry at you for fooling them with a ball of flavored ice. I do like these repeated references to the happy people of B who only has five kitchen sinks. But that really tells us we don't need to, like, state the obvious about what Barks how is describing

816
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,291
the Soviet union's

817
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:05,270
analog here.

818
01:12:05,949 --> 01:12:06,449
So

819
01:12:06,762 --> 01:12:08,859
You know, he runs at them,

820
01:12:09,237 --> 01:12:20,326
but he is tripped up by the penguin. And and finally, he resorts to a little trick with his helicopter So, you know, the the B has his pilot basically

821
01:12:20,983 --> 01:12:24,793
hover above them and and blow them back using the helicopters,

822
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:26,563
you know, force

823
01:12:27,461 --> 01:12:28,441
and is finally

824
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:32,396
able to grab that. He finds Scrooge notebook.

825
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:37,368
He immediately figures out that it must be important. He spots the notation

826
01:12:37,828 --> 01:12:38,808
about the coordinates.

827
01:12:40,028 --> 01:12:52,435
Latitude Omni down, longitudinal Dd, you know, it's Barks will sometimes use real coordinates in these stories, but doesn't really matter for this one. And as the Bra is about to tell the pilot

828
01:12:53,149 --> 01:12:55,968
where they're gonna go, they get a message

829
01:12:56,549 --> 01:13:01,448
from their short waive radio from Scrooge Du scientists.

830
01:13:02,283 --> 01:13:08,145
Trying to contact him. Do you want Va to tell us about the message that they get from home?

831
01:13:08,743 --> 01:13:09,961
Right. So the big

832
01:13:10,777 --> 01:13:12,729
saying org clock

833
01:13:13,229 --> 01:13:22,463
station x k two dot trying to contact Scrooge dot somewhere at South Pole. It's it's measured from Uncle Cruisers scientist is and

834
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:23,660
donald

835
01:13:24,277 --> 01:13:32,018
here to give it... Give them a single to read. And then they tell that they have probably used program boom one best you. They found only it was per.

836
01:13:33,518 --> 01:13:34,018
And...

837
01:13:34,718 --> 01:13:37,018
Yeah. And and I guess it's a really obvious

838
01:13:37,798 --> 01:13:41,593
what what this was is, but Scrooge says that

839
01:13:42,813 --> 01:13:46,248
he he he just wants to turn off who cares because he he doesn't have this

840
01:13:47,385 --> 01:13:48,802
anyway, but the

841
01:13:49,577 --> 01:13:50,077
comes

842
01:13:50,454 --> 01:13:51,712
comes Barks eye

843
01:13:52,169 --> 01:13:52,669
this

844
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,473
years experiments. So then they tend designs say that

845
01:13:59,453 --> 01:14:07,868
makes ice cream. One item of investing properties are barrel barrel water makes a barrel of ice screen and every barrel is a different flavor.

846
01:14:08,268 --> 01:14:09,508
Pistachio, p,

847
01:14:10,548 --> 01:14:13,503
pineapple, Cherry, Covid. And course the

848
01:14:14,443 --> 01:14:15,463
won't of this.

849
01:14:15,763 --> 01:14:17,543
But what use is that of.

850
01:14:18,364 --> 01:14:21,003
In, the happy people do not meet ice cream.

851
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:26,039
We should by not more on, I think. Yeah. Yeah.

852
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:39,453
This is one detail but Barks got wrong about the union because at least when not been in in Russia in times they it it lot ice Scrooge even in the winter. Have this products

853
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:47,243
sending it to the people in the space. So Wow. Ice like, ice cream traps even during the winter. Oh, yes. Yes. That's cool

854
01:14:47,823 --> 01:14:49,743
baby. Yeah. Right. That's interesting.

855
01:14:50,303 --> 01:14:56,616
So you guys... This is a definitely like a comic book moment you know, this is a very Disney moment

856
01:14:57,235 --> 01:14:59,492
because for one, it's a very whim

857
01:14:59,991 --> 01:15:02,369
outcome, you know, bomb ba,

858
01:15:02,803 --> 01:15:10,183
is not gonna be an analog for any kind of atomic bomb. It's it's all about ice cream It's obviously very silly.

859
01:15:10,843 --> 01:15:15,319
It's it's a it's a leap but I do find it very funny and very satisfying.

860
01:15:15,658 --> 01:15:19,399
What do you think Ryan? And he thoughts about the ultimate use for Ba?

861
01:15:19,819 --> 01:15:19,899
Yeah.

862
01:15:20,753 --> 01:15:32,646
I like it. I like... I like that there's a twist. I like that it's not actually a an endless power supply or or some other kind of thing that for them to fight over. I like the Big oven is is just ice cream just

863
01:15:33,065 --> 01:15:34,564
a trillion Al of ice.

864
01:15:35,103 --> 01:15:35,603
Right.

865
01:15:36,181 --> 01:15:38,239
Right. Right. And every adam.

866
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:44,727
Right? So I guess like I guess technically, if you like really, you could probably figure out a way to generate

867
01:15:45,266 --> 01:15:49,934
electricity if you're getting a a whole barrel of some thing from something the size of an adam.

868
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:57,032
But... But anyway, we're we're not meant to think too much about it. We're we're just supposed to know that

869
01:15:57,449 --> 01:16:09,113
that that there is an outcome and it's something that they'll that the young kids reading this are gonna really relate to, and they're gonna find it really delight. Fault. But because the Utopian,

870
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:14,935
you know, is definitely not interested in the joy that ice cream can bring, he takes the

871
01:16:15,312 --> 01:16:21,498
unforgivable step of burning the note so that no one can have it. How mad

872
01:16:21,838 --> 01:16:26,108
were you guys at the B and and is the answer so mad.

873
01:16:26,804 --> 01:16:43,774
I was super super bad. Yeah. It seemed it seemed so petty. Just so spite. It it benefits him nothing. It's not even, like, he spent any money on the thing. He just chased it, you know? And and well, he you know, resent it like he's been... He's been fleece somehow.

874
01:16:44,634 --> 01:16:46,549
Right. Yeah. I was I was pretty much

875
01:16:47,049 --> 01:16:50,429
as well, but I was also mad at Scrooge because

876
01:16:51,689 --> 01:16:53,589
before in the story, I get always said

877
01:16:54,023 --> 01:17:13,172
when it was reading reading his notes, even if you need it his on mind let it do so and so let me do so much such. So he he didn't say it the numbers himself and maybe that way he he could've have actually memorized them. He's instead setting them know I'm just on side. Yeah. This is another example. Of him being very careless,

878
01:17:13,871 --> 01:17:17,787
probably not quite in his in his, you know, at his best.

879
01:17:18,546 --> 01:17:34,204
Hopefully, Barks has done a good job of just find that. Because, yeah, we can all say that load, he should have had all the Inducks chanting the numbers together so that they memorized it etcetera, etcetera. If I had one hundred dollars buried somewhere, I would memorize its location so well.

880
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:35,584
Right.

881
01:17:36,244 --> 01:17:36,644
Right.

882
01:17:37,818 --> 01:17:40,356
So I like... I like that in this

883
01:17:41,214 --> 01:17:44,031
almost closing sequence. You know, he gets to

884
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:45,429
in his misery

885
01:17:45,984 --> 01:17:46,923
with peggy

886
01:17:47,302 --> 01:17:50,158
as he calls the penguin at this point,

887
01:17:50,657 --> 01:17:55,204
and then they check to see if there's any follow up information from Doctor.

888
01:17:55,861 --> 01:18:02,861
And they learned that our episodes sponsor the leaky Kona ice cream company would like to provide

889
01:18:03,254 --> 01:18:04,353
Al of Bombastic

890
01:18:04,892 --> 01:18:05,392
offering...

891
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:09,267
Now you know, business one zero one, I'm thinking says

892
01:18:09,846 --> 01:18:11,684
cost plus ten percent.

893
01:18:12,338 --> 01:18:12,498
Right?

894
01:18:13,177 --> 01:18:13,677
Probably

895
01:18:14,414 --> 01:18:21,360
a good good ballpark. But for little kids reading it, we're just gonna double it. They're offering two trillion dollars for the ball.

896
01:18:22,412 --> 01:18:24,587
So sc could even have turned

897
01:18:24,965 --> 01:18:46,785
boy. Not just a profit Quite a profit. Yeah. And and the doctor you know, they're gonna give it the old try. They're gonna see if they can remember or he can't remember, but they're gonna see if they can find it And at this point, you know, they turn the penguin loose to let her a head back to the coast, having no doubt forgotten all about the quote egg by now. But predictably,

898
01:18:47,483 --> 01:18:53,411
you know, this is an arctic. It's it's all ice. There's a few mountains, but there... There's nothing

899
01:18:53,924 --> 01:18:54,664
to reference,

900
01:18:55,602 --> 01:18:58,558
and there's no way that they're gonna find it.

901
01:18:59,357 --> 01:19:04,269
And and then this story wraps up it the resolution is excellent,

902
01:19:04,729 --> 01:19:06,189
I think. Because,

903
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:17,585
of course, we've all read stories about animals doing incredible things that are, like, physically impossible for humans that they have some kind of an innate sense.

904
01:19:18,145 --> 01:19:18,645
Indeed

905
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:20,637
One of the Inducks

906
01:19:20,677 --> 01:19:23,454
buys something on the horizon and through the,

907
01:19:23,993 --> 01:19:26,810
they see that it is that devoted

908
01:19:27,443 --> 01:19:30,457
adorable penguin, and she is t

909
01:19:30,835 --> 01:19:37,977
to a spot that she seems to know where she's going. I'm sure enough. She she leads them to

910
01:19:38,316 --> 01:19:40,873
the ball of ba thinking it's an egg.

911
01:19:41,832 --> 01:19:43,869
Brian, what does Scrooge say?

912
01:19:44,961 --> 01:19:45,461
So

913
01:19:46,834 --> 01:19:56,684
when she finds the Barks ass sits on it. This old girl can sit on the best Bump him for a while. She can even melt off a few billion dollars worth she's earned this.

914
01:19:58,101 --> 01:19:59,600
It's it's pretty un,

915
01:20:00,354 --> 01:20:14,330
but it's also it does feel very earned for peggy there. Yeah. And then it wraps up with a a fun little book ending vic code. Do you wanna tell us the how the story wraps up? Yes. So so they were back in an auction

916
01:20:14,947 --> 01:20:16,286
with the testing that...

917
01:20:17,263 --> 01:20:23,214
So now whenever on Scrooge goes goes to the auction, people think he's a little clear. And then then there are people

918
01:20:23,914 --> 01:20:26,154
whispering Scrooge. That's the people's Scrooge

919
01:20:27,049 --> 01:20:44,384
indeed. I've heard of him. They say he always makes one brother's Scrooge purchase. Yes. A ping with. But he buys one every time a new shipment comes come from the from Barks. Does even anyone know what he does with the egg Yes. He ships it back to the and thirty to be given to a certain big ping.

920
01:20:44,918 --> 01:20:47,853
Certain thing. Can see that. And then and then we see

921
01:20:48,551 --> 01:20:52,084
manning is very there bid a dollar high dollar for.

922
01:20:52,582 --> 01:21:05,675
Right. It's very cute. I like it. I think it's a nice... It's a pretty abrupt ending, but but I think it's a nice way to book and it with the auction and and wrap it up to to show that that gratitude. That very un

923
01:21:06,331 --> 01:21:06,831
gratitude

924
01:21:07,327 --> 01:21:26,880
that he shows for the penguin. And that is that is a cold bargain gentleman. I I really enjoyed talking about this one. Let's let's go ahead and share, you know, our our overall thoughts about the story. Ryan, do you wanna go first? Sure. I like it a lot. I like... You know, we go somewhere new. Again, we're

925
01:21:27,194 --> 01:21:28,610
kind of facing off against

926
01:21:29,147 --> 01:21:29,885
a real

927
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:33,632
villain which we don't always get in these stories. And

928
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:41,272
and then the penguins are very cute. The penguin one is the hear of the story, and like, everybody kind of gets a happy ending except for the happy people of B help.

929
01:21:42,729 --> 01:21:42,849
Right.

930
01:21:43,544 --> 01:22:07,816
Yeah. As someone who... I haven't had you do a ton of the Scrooge adventures. I know you got to do the secret of Lan, which is a very famous one. What did you think of this is just like a it has a Barks screwed story as someone who's... Who hasn't read a ton of these over many decades. Yeah. I mean, it seemed it's seemed very Scrooge to me. You know, some circumstances come up, and he sees opportunity to make a lot of money and

931
01:22:08,208 --> 01:22:12,018
things get pretty crazy, and then he's walking on a whale. And and...

932
01:22:12,435 --> 01:22:18,513
Yeah. There's some... There's some adventure. There's a little bit of payroll. There's a little bit of quick thinking. Right now a little bit of luck Yeah.

933
01:22:19,513 --> 01:22:19,593
Yes.

934
01:22:20,634 --> 01:22:21,134
Excellent.

935
01:22:21,754 --> 01:22:30,144
How what about You waco? What what are your... What's... Where are you on this? Well, yes, sir I mean, as Mentioned, it it is it is one of my favorites of the late

936
01:22:30,802 --> 01:22:34,394
which stories. I I of, like the cold war

937
01:22:35,171 --> 01:22:35,870
team that's.

938
01:22:36,445 --> 01:22:36,945
I

939
01:22:37,362 --> 01:22:47,119
like the fact that it's it's so task moving as as as I mentioned And also since I generally tend to like the ten pages more than the long,

940
01:22:47,735 --> 01:22:50,844
I I I like factor that the beginning of the stories

941
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,164
sort of like a...

942
01:22:52,504 --> 01:22:53,484
Or almost a

943
01:22:54,224 --> 01:23:03,235
dent or of the adding for online just when they're funding the both capacity still Barks in in in Barks. And and then then since I'm

944
01:23:03,731 --> 01:23:06,524
bit animal lover, I I always like these

945
01:23:07,304 --> 01:23:08,084
stories with

946
01:23:08,385 --> 01:23:10,204
with with some other animals and

947
01:23:11,184 --> 01:23:12,764
especially this stories where

948
01:23:13,398 --> 01:23:14,696
Sk has this

949
01:23:15,753 --> 01:23:26,837
phone that's for for animal yeah for the team win and I I think there's there's not not story where. Yeah. Yeah Al also set up somewhere in a snowy way the location where where he has

950
01:23:27,374 --> 01:23:30,159
gets we gets friendly with with some some dog I

951
01:23:31,057 --> 01:23:32,135
which started. Oh, yeah.

952
01:23:32,893 --> 01:23:35,708
North north of the Yukon with Yeah.

953
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:43,714
With old Barks, the the ba. Hey. Yeah. That's that's a fun one. That's probably Scrooge at his softest.

954
01:23:44,454 --> 01:23:58,691
Interesting seen this kind soft version of sp. You know, you mentioned that this one kinda opens like a ten page I think you're right, and and it kind of feels like a good complement to that secret of Atlanta to story I did with you, Ryan, how that one opens

955
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:06,776
as a ten pager and then it kind of expands into an adventure. Although, this one never really loses that kind of semi.

956
01:24:07,874 --> 01:24:20,637
Tone. It is nice. I think it's nice that the B does feel like like a threat. Right? Because the story is otherwise, so light hard. That's true. I point you missed the point where where

957
01:24:21,229 --> 01:24:27,669
the representative from Bert when he's taking control of the situation into Antarctica, and Donald is trying to get the notebook.

958
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:44,029
The Says, must I do Bro hope and folk dance on your thick head to teach you that I boss here? Right. Yeah. That's a good thing to point out because he... He's a heavy. Right? And he... He pulls a gun on them, Does he? I don't remember the gun. Why do I... Why am I visualizing him with a gun?

959
01:24:44,909 --> 01:24:51,629
Maybe I'm mis remembering. I know that they've got the guns shit pointed hot. Yeah. The submarine does have its tour. Yeah.

960
01:24:52,625 --> 01:24:55,055
Right. Well, just twice there's nice. Yes.

961
01:24:55,788 --> 01:24:58,520
Yeah. He... He's he is a genuine threat.

962
01:24:59,574 --> 01:25:19,729
I think this is a great story. I think it... I think it lands really well. I think it holds up really. Well, definitely a bit of a cold war artifact. But but in in the best way. For the same reasons you said they you know, it's a neat... Look. It's it's nice that it it kinda soften and Scrooge, but he's never like, overly

963
01:25:20,107 --> 01:25:22,402
soft. Right? He's still definitely

964
01:25:22,794 --> 01:25:24,810
ru Inducks in this one.

965
01:25:25,228 --> 01:25:49,424
And the penguin is just adorable. It's it's a lot of fun all around. I I remember reading this one a lot. As a kid over and over. So you guys I mentioned that, you know, I really like this story. This is a a favorite of mine. It's maybe not like a all time favorite, but it's it's pretty close. It's it's pretty high up there for me. And we like to check in on the Ducktales community

966
01:25:49,924 --> 01:25:55,719
as seen through the website Inducks, which is a great resource for all Disney comics

967
01:25:56,739 --> 01:25:58,399
and has a nice ranking

968
01:25:58,794 --> 01:26:01,254
system where people will will assign

969
01:26:01,674 --> 01:26:23,690
a value to it. So it's it's it's a good if imp precise way to get a feel for the community So this one does rank very highly. This has an eight point zero out of ten. As of today, you know, these do change a bit over the time, but they generally stay pretty consistent. And that's good for number thirty five out of all like roughly forty two thousand

970
01:26:24,028 --> 01:26:46,777
Disney comics that are ranked on the site. And it... So if you pull out just the Barks ones, I don't know exactly where it lands, but that's probably roughly the top twenty five or so story. So so this is a very well remembered very well regarded story. Al as far as how this as far as follow ups or other Disney comics or other media,

971
01:26:47,553 --> 01:26:47,712
you know,

972
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:53,011
I don't think there's ever been a lot of big sql from big name artist.

973
01:26:53,947 --> 01:26:55,723
A number of other Disney

974
01:26:56,061 --> 01:27:09,749
comments, Barks writers have used, like, root top as a setting or like, a fictional country. I know that Don Rose and one of his stories briefly, like, I think he'll use the representative as, like, a just a background character.

975
01:27:10,444 --> 01:27:17,576
Occasionally but he never did any of his sequels or follow ups. To this. Ryan, do you remember back in the eighties, duck

976
01:27:17,915 --> 01:27:25,704
had a big five episode arc where they went back in time, and they encountered the cave... The cave Ducktales.

977
01:27:27,871 --> 01:27:35,667
Baba Duck, he... He's a... He's a recurring character and the Ducktales series that a lot of bark stands. And and I guess a lot of Ducktales fans

978
01:27:36,059 --> 01:27:45,314
don't like... He's a pretty annoying character, but the kids tend to delight him. So they they used him Anyway, the time machine that Ji Gear loose

979
01:27:45,814 --> 01:27:46,314
built

980
01:27:46,653 --> 01:27:48,551
that takes them back to the past

981
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:51,108
in this episode, which is called

982
01:27:51,447 --> 01:27:58,684
this five episode arc, which is called time is money. That time machine was powered by Bombastic. Naturally. Yes.

983
01:27:59,442 --> 01:27:59,942
So

984
01:28:01,037 --> 01:28:03,491
second use. We found the second use for mom.

985
01:28:04,043 --> 01:28:07,295
This the ice cream thing and also time travel. Roughly,

986
01:28:07,752 --> 01:28:18,796
I would say in this. Yeah So so dale never really tackle the story, but they use they just use Ba as this throw away element, I think it rolls off the tongue nicely.

987
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:26,284
So other than that, again, other artists have used B Help, and I think the b being representative has appeared occasionally

988
01:28:26,824 --> 01:28:38,854
Alright. So you guys were about ready to wrap up I'm I'm really glad to have covered this one, but before we go, are there any handles that, like, really stood out to you that we didn't already get to highlight.

989
01:28:39,274 --> 01:28:40,334
My favorite was

990
01:28:40,834 --> 01:28:43,014
at the auction after

991
01:28:43,514 --> 01:28:53,641
Scrooge and another guy who is not a duck, he has a appoint beak have been pushed over and and now they're just like under the feet of the other of the other auction attendees,

992
01:28:54,560 --> 01:29:20,502
and they're just chatting with each. And so I just like the shot of the two of them just just down on the ground, and then you see all the legs and shoes behind them as they're talking with each other about what's going on in this same and It's just... I mean, it's just exposition. You have to you have to deduct the position here at the beginning, and he just found a really interesting way of framing that in individual medium. Yeah. I think that's a great one to highlight. Mostly because that entire auction

993
01:29:20,839 --> 01:29:22,416
just panel by panel.

994
01:29:23,209 --> 01:29:24,789
Is is very funny,

995
01:29:25,169 --> 01:29:29,684
very well drawn. I especially like the one where the B is just

996
01:29:30,304 --> 01:29:34,404
staring dagger at the general scooters guy, Scrooge is just

997
01:29:35,184 --> 01:29:39,204
considering them still still on the floor from that tram

998
01:29:39,678 --> 01:29:47,502
So so, yeah, I would encourage readers to really take a look at that whole auction sequence because it is is white. What about you waco?

999
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:51,291
Yeah. I mean, this story doesn't really have any of these

1000
01:29:51,830 --> 01:29:53,569
flash panels that that

1001
01:29:53,988 --> 01:29:57,859
Barks was famous for there's one oversized panel

1002
01:29:58,197 --> 01:29:58,856
on the

1003
01:29:59,194 --> 01:30:01,449
various page, but it just the shows

1004
01:30:01,907 --> 01:30:05,094
score to go and going into the the auction. So it's from like a

1005
01:30:05,914 --> 01:30:11,094
spectacular panel anything. So I I I think I I will have to name this very last

1006
01:30:11,474 --> 01:30:11,974
panel

1007
01:30:12,274 --> 01:30:15,788
with the scotia test and the team my that's my favorite

1008
01:30:16,407 --> 01:30:19,503
it it's just so funny and hard the way

1009
01:30:20,921 --> 01:30:22,154
smiling and and

1010
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:31,025
so happy. You're so happy so it is. And it's adorable. It's a great one. Awesome. Well, you guys thank you so much.

1011
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:48,474

1012
01:30:48,989 --> 01:30:50,329

story land of the p.

1014
