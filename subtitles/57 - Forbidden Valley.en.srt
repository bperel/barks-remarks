1
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,495
We can have

2
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:37,825
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Mc Ducktales writer Al artist of the greatest donald and Scrooge comments of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological

3
00:00:38,163 --> 00:01:19,066
publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Just a quick technical note. I had a few audio issues with this one. I had a Mike cord that unbeknownst to me was popping in and out a little bit, and so sometimes my nice microphone was my audio source, and sometimes, my lap top, not so ice microphone was my audio source. I I went and adjusted. I could, I think it came out pretty fine. Unfortunately, it's mostly the mic, but But here and there, just bear with it as the audio

4
00:01:19,643 --> 00:01:24,428
does its thing and know that it should go back for the most part. And enjoy the app episode?

5
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:39,406
Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever, a Grown man who enjoys com and I'm joined by a couple of other grown men. To talk about a later Donald Inducks adventure, I'm really excited gentlemen because this is one of the

6
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:48,792
where I get to pair a long time fan with newbie and my newbie today is my brother, Dan Sever. Dan, thank you so much for coming back. Yeah. Absolutely.

7
00:01:49,184 --> 00:01:54,078
So I had you on some time ago for a big top Bed, which

8
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,435
it has some wonderful

9
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:03,150
mid century art. But other than that, it's kind of a weird one to start out when reading Barks.

10
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:30,930
So I'm I'm glad to bring you back to one that has more of a traditional narrative. Yeah. I I did enjoy Big talk Battle it was a fun one. It is a fun one. But it's it's kind of a strange almost after thought of a story. But I'm glad you did enjoy it. If I already to be honest, I would say I actually kinda like bit Big Bed. Better. It's... I found a little more action packed, but this one was good too. Excellent. Well, I'm curious to hear what you have to hear about it

11
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,127
and my long time

12
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:34,505
returning Ducktales

13
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:36,244
is Warren Harmon.

14
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:39,055
And warren you and I were just talking about

15
00:02:39,752 --> 00:03:10,400
about how many of these episodes I've gotten to have you on. You're definitely one of my frequent flyers. But... That's great. I've had a a lot of fun and being a long time Barks fan and and Donald duct collector and Disney fan. I mean, I'd say, this is a natural fit for me, and I just enjoyed the conversations and the the research and the the education that you're giving, everybody in the duct community, I mean, with from your Facebook site to the podcast everything it's been it's a lot of fun. So thank you, and it's happy to do it. So it's been great ride. And

16
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:19,477
and, you know, for Dan too, this this story as Mark said, this this is more familiar territory for Barks. The the worldwide adventure with the nephews,

17
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:26,238
it it may lack Scrooge Inducks, but... Yeah. That's okay. Right. Yeah. This is kind of a classic iteration.

18
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:32,877
You you watch Ducktales when you were a kid dan does this kind of feel like it's in the same vein as that? I...

19
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:34,993
I don't know if you even remember watching.

20
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:36,289
We were a lot younger.

21
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:37,986
We had tennessee

22
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:40,477
Yeah. I absolutely remember watching it.

23
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:41,835
A lot of the

24
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:45,111
episodes. I I have trouble calling, but

25
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:48,236
this one did seem to follow a

26
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:51,225
kind that classic format of

27
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:53,195
one thing leading to the next.

28
00:03:53,689 --> 00:04:05,025
I would say. Yeah, it's definitely less slaps stick mayhem ham than the when I previously had you on for. So again, to be official, we are here today to talk about Forbidden Valley, which is a fairly

29
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:28,730
late Donald Inducks adventure. We don't have a lot of them left to do. So I'm gonna mention a little bit of the Barks around about this story, and then we'll get the narrative for it. But this one was published in the year nineteen fifty seven with a July cover date. It was in donald dot number fifty four. Warren in the thing that struck me about this one when I checked it on index is that has an unusually small number of reprint. I noticed that two mark

30
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:38,262
you know, if I think the next was almost what ten years later or maybe maybe I'm even mistaken in there, but very small number.

31
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,727
It it it came out at a time nineteen fifty seven. I'm proud to say that's the year I was born. So

32
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:54,220
that it was created in December of nineteen fifty six, and then finally published in July, I believe a fifty seven. And like you said, and

33
00:04:54,694 --> 00:05:01,457
Yeah. I I think this is one of Barks is returned to form And, again, I'm gonna say it's familiar territory,

34
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:09,210
I'm kinda of glad he did it and we'll we'll talk a little bit about what works and what doesn't work in my opinion too. Yeah. Yeah. There's definitely a lot to cover.

35
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:15,566
You're you're right Warren. There was a a big thirty year gap on thirty thirty year. Yeah.

36
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:19,949
Yeah. Between donald dot number fifty four and the first

37
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:34,227
reprint and glad stones run. Yeah Yep. I have that one. Yeah. Nineteen eighty six. It's got a pretty cool done yet this cover. So it's rate cover. Yeah, it looks like those were the only two new stand collections. The rest of them were like Carl Barks library and

38
00:05:34,686 --> 00:05:37,119
collection publications. This this a weirdly...

39
00:05:37,697 --> 00:05:56,306
This one just Barks exposure for whatever reason. So So, Dan, I'm curious this one falls into a classic story archetype, the the lost world archetype. Is that something that you are familiar with? Is that something you you enjoy that you're gonna kick out? Yeah. Yeah. It was it was definitely...

40
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:58,181
It it it wasn't

41
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:15,836
expected from the beginning that that it would end up that way. So it was it was enjoyable to see without giving any way, how they would... How they ended up Al this lost world and and right. The details of the lost world. Like we said earlier, Dan, you said that there's one one one scene

42
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:22,315
strangely leads to another seat, and then it leads to another scene and what begins as this sort of quest

43
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,715
to read a neighborhood of a pest

44
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:37,050
becomes this incredible, but we'll find out journey to the Forbidden Valley. Yeah. Conan doyle lost world cup still life again. So yes. Warren. I'm glad you referenced that classic.

45
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:51,393
Do you you wanna tell us that our Arthur Conan doyle. Right? Well arthur Conan and Doyle, everybody knows from Sherlock Holmes fame, but also a a the literary genius it his time and came up with a fan full about

46
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,510
beautiful story

47
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:56,918
of discovery a lost world where ancient

48
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,391
rep reptile existed in modern world. And...

49
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,485
Yeah. It's a it's a great story.

50
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:05,991
On several movie adaptations have been made. And

51
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:15,298
we'll get to this, but you know, when we look at nineteen fifty seven when this was created, fifty six fifty seven, and he was probably thinking about it in fifty six.

52
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:19,805
You're not looking at a lot of movies we're starting to play around with these themes.

53
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:27,560
There was signs fiction was coming of age the bob with Steve Mc mcqueen was was there. But these adventures to far off lands

54
00:07:27,938 --> 00:07:32,010
were also there now lost Horizon was about two twenty years earlier,

55
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:35,601
but this is this is in that vein of the great

56
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,435
movies of the of the fifties and maybe even the bible that that were

57
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:41,727
dry.

58
00:07:42,183 --> 00:08:01,076
Right. And and if you're reading this story decades later, I think that's the important take. That that's the thing to know about it. That's what you're getting is this take on the Her Arthur conan Doyle story? He he is the first guy rather the the first, you know, person who famously wrote about this this archetype, a group of outsiders

59
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:02,913
journey to a

60
00:08:03,452 --> 00:08:12,307
lost Al where time has stood still for for whatever reason or another. And and and consequently, we're gonna have a story that features dinosaurs.

61
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:20,058
This is pretty unique warren. This is the only Barks story. Is is that right? This is the only... We had Al

62
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:27,327
trail of the unicorn that's not quite the same. But we were they stumbled on this incorrectly. But this is the only one that oh with dinosaurs.

63
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:37,345
Yeah. And so, Dan, the thing about this is this came about obviously a lot long before you and I were kids watching jurassic park for the fiftieth time

64
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:39,300
This is the like earlier

65
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:43,665
iteration of pop culture dinosaurs, you know, before Al

66
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:47,077
had advanced a little bit before Steven Spielberg

67
00:08:47,669 --> 00:09:01,007
kinda of popularized the more accurate or early Al least somewhat more accurate modern take on them. Yeah So what what did you think of the depiction of Dinosaurs in this one dan. I thought they were really cool, actually. I I love the one

68
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:02,165
that was

69
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,440
giving them a ride. That one was...

70
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:06,095
I did two.

71
00:09:06,788 --> 00:09:08,285
List the giant

72
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:13,391
really cool. I I really like that. Yeah. Almost wishing

73
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:17,600
that it became sort of like a sub character within the story or something,

74
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:27,602
you know, like a little bit of personality or or Also found myself wanting to see more of that particular dinosaur. Yeah. It's a bummer that it meets a pretty quick

75
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:28,881
end there.

76
00:09:29,473 --> 00:09:42,063
Yeah, I think that's really important. To keep in mind that this is that archetype of the lost world. And Warren, the other kinda notable bit of Barks trivia about this one is that... I I didn't realize this until I was checking into it, but

77
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,020
we have a pretty significant first appearance here. Right? You do. We do nineteen fifty seven

78
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:51,531
from the research I've done and and looking back at some of the other

79
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,739
stories of Angus mix Wine

80
00:09:55,156 --> 00:10:14,683
makes his debut in this story. Love the name. E isn't Angus Mc wine in the story is the the pic character is Barks has created as appeared in many stories. Yeah. The pig faced villain, but probably one of our favorite was dialed the milk man and of course, we did that one together and boy, he's a main character Is he dan. Right.

81
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:20,035
Yeah. Yeah. He's just perfectly emblem of a greedy

82
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:22,194
do whatever it takes

83
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:29,085
to to to get ahead. Yeah. That's about him He's always really cut throat nasty ambitious.

84
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:33,415
It's kind of weird to me how Huey, used him. Right warren. Be because,

85
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:43,526
he's kind of an anonymous villain. He changes the name frequently. All the time. We're calling him wine here because that's the name that he has the most. Mh.

86
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:46,343
But like, Barb was totally

87
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:54,987
inconsistent he would use like, in this one, his first name is connected to the, like the whole guy with pickles clearly. But.

88
00:10:56,125 --> 00:11:00,150
Yeah. He... He's he's not... He's never the same character.

89
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:07,944
He's just drawn the same. He's his bark like generic papers face to vi. And he's just so nasty.

90
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:19,665
And when Barks didn't wanna use, like, flint Guam gold or, you know, the the story didn't call for magic. So we didn't wanna magic to spell the other ones to be almost. He just had his go to

91
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,221
generic nasty.

92
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:33,412
You know, we talked about this being the debut, and I and I and I just want ask you, mark, didn't the great steamboat race with Horseshoe hog come before this though, or am I am I mistaken? Well, I did. But I mean I don't.

93
00:11:33,868 --> 00:11:35,922
Yeah. Worst july is like

94
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:37,374
very friends

95
00:11:37,992 --> 00:11:41,389
That's he was he was more of the southern gentleman. Yeah. Yeah Yeah.

96
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:59,465
I'm looking in my mine's memory here looking at what what I I thought I saw Right but I... But I do know the mix line appears later and one of my favorite all time favorite Inducks stories in nineteen sixty six. So call the micro doctor outer space that's my favorite depiction of it. Nice. Yeah. That's a fun one.

97
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:09,173
I'm gonna I'm gonna run through some of his different names. What sure. I wanted to verify this on index that he was the first appearance.

98
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:19,077
That this was the first appearance you you can use Inducks to sort by the first appearance. And so this does tell me that here he is as p j Brian,

99
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:20,974
but he's also been Poor Man.

100
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:25,760
He's been he's been des sw.

101
00:12:26,257 --> 00:12:29,149
He's been foul Scrooge in crown me.

102
00:12:29,726 --> 00:12:32,977
Scouts nick. John the khan his his micro.

103
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:34,149
Appearance.

104
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:39,463
Yes to make the library. He's had a ton of them. I I guess that arguably

105
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:40,761
in old

106
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,355
California, did have, like, a a flashback

107
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:46,675
version of this character

108
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:51,005
I don't know if he's... I don't know if he's similar enough. He's obviously,

109
00:12:51,461 --> 00:13:10,702
like an earlier, you know, Al flash version. So yeah. Inducks doesn't count. So so I'm gonna call it. This is his first official appearance. Office official. That's right. Yeah. And I think Barks played around with the an pig figure too. I mean, he really wanted to see what he could do with another animal. And like you said be the foil

110
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:29,081
and billing, but I think what he has going for him angus is Mc wine is he's probably one of the minus feelings I've ever met in my life. Sometimes he's said the bigger boys work with him very rarely, but I think But this solo act and what he's doing here, we'll get into the story and maybe comment on some of his

111
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,885
his way would you call it? I don't... I'm

112
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:35,121
is is vicious tactics to get the

113
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:39,095
office very under hand you you love to hate. That's right. Alright.

114
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:46,620
And the other notable thing that I've gotta mention before we get into this is that this is one of the situations where Barks

115
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:56,319
kind of remake... This is one of his pseudo remakes. He used this story structure once before and his older story called in Barks Africa,

116
00:13:56,738 --> 00:13:57,238
which

117
00:13:57,657 --> 00:14:01,233
you you can probably guess by the title Dan is a pretty

118
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:22,010
problematic story. We know we've bought I I want you to feel... I'm very curious when we get to that part to get your impression of of how how those you know, depictions have not aged. Have not aged well. Sure. I don't know. Did you find it jarring like, did you just kinda think of, this is part for the course with, you know, a comment look this.

119
00:14:22,347 --> 00:14:27,353
Yeah. I I saw as a product of its time and just

120
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,638
maybe a little bit of just ignorance

121
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:35,182
in attitudes that people can tend to have

122
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:36,537
until they

123
00:14:36,914 --> 00:14:55,800
become less ignorant about the world and more more educated about the world. Right. And and you know, we talked pretty about this, how these are just kind of like the the tropes that were just widespread and employment world. It doesn't use it. It's just it's something that we we understand it we don't excuse it.

124
00:14:56,732 --> 00:15:09,770
Barks was born in nineteen o one was he born at nineteen hundred and nineteen o one. I always forget more. But he it Huey, to ninety nine. Yeah. He died in in in August of two thousand. So he was

125
00:15:10,306 --> 00:15:30,324
one to two yeah. Correct. Yeah. So like warren, I think this must have been kind of a period for him that was a little bit. I think he must have had a little bit of of a struggle with creativity me around this time. You've got my three stories. They're pretty close to each other where he does this, he goes back to the well.

126
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:34,790
I pretty recently recorded an episode for land of the Picnic Inducks.

127
00:15:35,124 --> 00:15:45,020
Which is, like, very close to this one and that that's like a a soft remake of because early storing mystery of the swan. And then, you know, he's got

128
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:56,715
city of golden and roofs, which is like. Is it coming up very soon, which is again, kind of remake of the land of the tone pole. So he does a lot of this story recycling,

129
00:15:57,215 --> 00:15:59,795
which, you know, I think he makes them different

130
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:00,375
emails.

131
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:03,163
But it's it's definitely something you noticed.

132
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:14,586
I would agree. I I my comment earlier when They mentioned. I he went back to familiar territory it's the same thing you saying, and And, you know, the reader might say, and, like Dan said earlier,

133
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:32,323
yeah, It was a good story maybe not a great story. But I will we'll we'll we can move through it, but I really think he he struggled a little bit with finding some really out there new ideas. And so I think introducing the loss world element was one way to do that. And certainly, Mc Brian, the character

134
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:36,088
brought a new dimension to it too. But for me it was

135
00:16:36,626 --> 00:16:43,711
it it was certainly past what you would call the golden era of of Barks. Right. Now. We're still gonna got some classic

136
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:44,843
not.

137
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:53,106
Gentlemen, I wanted to I wanna dive into the store itself, but before we do on a pan to our International

138
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:54,358
international.

139
00:16:55,454 --> 00:17:02,593
Dan, I am just pasting into the chats the with two of the German titles. Would you mind

140
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,305
presenting the German titles after I have lauren

141
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:12,028
do? Let's see. Warren and why don't I give you the Brazilian title just because it's

142
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:18,201
geographically the closest to the story setting. There we go. Yeah. We're in the Amazon. Right? So it's appropriate. Yeah. Yeah.

143
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:27,369
We... We're at the eastern part of South America, and I was at Dan doesn't know this Marked does, but I returned from the Amazon Rainforest and

144
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:33,270
October, I was up in Ecuador and beautiful and some of the jungle depictions are very familiar. So

145
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:34,944
absolutely

146
00:17:37,295 --> 00:17:39,015
Al. I'm sorry. Yeah.

147
00:17:40,295 --> 00:17:43,675
Start So here's the Brazilian title. Ave ventura

148
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:44,569
No,

149
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:45,446
Roy

150
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:51,845
Ave ventura, No Valley Pro, sort of venture in the the for the prohibited Valley. A pretty...

151
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:55,034
For the most part, they were pretty great translations.

152
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:56,432
What right...

153
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,305
Mind give the german? No. Not at all. I Hope the native German speakers

154
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:04,435
are too put off by it. But

155
00:18:04,853 --> 00:18:18,205
and crystal, which is the cucumber crisis. So that one cracks me up. Right? It's the the cucumber prices are really the pickle crisis. Right? Because I think we can must be pickle. Mh. Right thirteen.

156
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:25,120
Which is a great title. It doesn't tell you anything that the story except the the goofy part.

157
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:30,249
And then I I gave myself french title, which is Mcdonald's

158
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:32,484
Plural,

159
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,975
and it's mcdonald's war for pickles.

160
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:49,020
Again, a pretty off one. So so I gotta a kick got it. I gotta kick out of looking account that. Alright, Gentlemen. Are you guys ready to file into the forbidden valley here. We are. All set.

161
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:50,518
Alright. So

162
00:18:50,857 --> 00:18:52,755
this one has an interesting

163
00:18:53,309 --> 00:19:02,750
start. It's... To be honest, it's kind of a stretch to you guys because it's got donald reading an issue of the doctorate times for the deck Google, I guess.

164
00:19:03,564 --> 00:19:14,501
He's not looking where he's going, and he is wandering through, like, a pretty rural area, where he doesn't seem to have any reason to be just like, I'm mostly reading a news newspaper, to be honest,

165
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:20,495
and he is reading about how the government is spending another billion dollars to knock out the fruit fly

166
00:19:21,112 --> 00:19:25,041
It's just reading all these Ducktales of, like, the Us government finding

167
00:19:25,696 --> 00:19:28,987
insects in fast infestation, which is definitely something

168
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:34,674
that, you know, is truthful. Right? This this is something that's constantly happening

169
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:43,347
Any answer up, he's wandering through either, like, field of prompts or garden and he ends up tripping over one of his nephews,

170
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:54,510
and he gives off the the head How didn't you let where I'm don? And he asks is matthew what he's up to, he explains that he's looking in the bind for author nose

171
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:57,795
which are a dreadful

172
00:19:58,252 --> 00:19:59,230
south American

173
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:03,136
cucumber board that is destroying the Ducktales pickle

174
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:19,506
prompt. So I usually say you guys that we've got them... I usually call the openings pretty strong. Know that this is the strongest opening he's ever had. It's kinda of per performed to me the it is very funny. Dan your mind reading the little

175
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:28,460
the little narrator box before the very beginning by far the fiercest battle ever wage is man's battle with Bugs.

176
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:50,807
And and got this little ferocious looking bug hissing and snorkeling. But I don't know. I... It's it's a fine opening. It's very funny donald trips, but I do feel like this one might be a little force. It seems force, but we have to somehow get to the pickles and get to the cucumbers, I guess it's one way. The other thing is that I feel like Barks has used the bug

177
00:20:51,305 --> 00:21:15,046
theme in other stories too, and he's got one coming up just a year later in gigantic gan and you've got others that he's done, but I... Yeah. I think it's it's it's it's to me, it's a fun way to introduce it. I love. I love that line you said about him wanted to look where Going. I think that's fantastic. I mean, I just backed up when I read that. But... Yeah. It's... Yeah. We have to get there and this is how we get there. And he also

178
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,219
to see Donald

179
00:21:16,638 --> 00:21:20,694
embroiled in reading about the Us government just seems a little far fetched to me, but

180
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:21,613
Right.

181
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:31,367
Right. It's a classic dry you in character listening to a reading about the news... Yeah. It was news to me that the the fruit fly was bad enough to warrant

182
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:59,074
getting rid of. I thought it was good. I thought because he caught... I don't know which were the triplets it is. Him also surprised that for a moment, I thought they were telling Donald like, hey, why don't you look out where you're going? But it turned out to be Donald saying about you look at where I'm going. So Right. I thought that was pretty good. Yeah. It's it's a very funny simple. So we we got the stories from the Matthews pretty quickly what they're up to. They have been commissioned by some local sciences to

183
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:01,614
catch some of these pickle haters,

184
00:22:01,974 --> 00:22:10,014
and they're gonna get five cents for each one of them, which is, you know, probably fifty five or sixty cents in modern denominator

185
00:22:10,552 --> 00:22:23,718
so not not too bad. And, you know, Donald is is very supportive of this. He decides that he wants to help there there aren't too many of them around because they're just in the early stages of the investigation.

186
00:22:24,396 --> 00:22:26,092
And they allude to how experience

187
00:22:26,524 --> 00:22:31,945
mysterious oh the the pickle orders. I love the name by the way of those

188
00:22:32,404 --> 00:22:35,264
you guys. How they got there and They eventually

189
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:48,216
do and counter one that's getting ready to drill a acute pump. Dan you Mind telling us about, like, what kind of the bugs, like the what's the bugs specific track. How does that intent?

190
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,970
They basically

191
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:53,237
drill into it, like, as if it were or

192
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:59,362
like a modern drill kinda spiking through the crop. And, yeah, this one particular,

193
00:23:00,021 --> 00:23:00,720
when he

194
00:23:01,153 --> 00:23:08,069
when the bug drills into it, he pulls out, like, what looks to be almost like a cork that was keeping in what

195
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:20,367
some gas from escaping or so. Maybe maybe the the odor from the pickle. It just completely deflate. It's it's very hard to modern. But I I found it very funny.

196
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:24,714
And I also really like the feature design and Al little, like...

197
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:26,011
Threatening

198
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:27,168
in the

199
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:27,819
the

200
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:28,818
insects

201
00:23:29,156 --> 00:23:37,934
face. What did you guys think of the Barks itself? I love the bug. I I I and I'd love. I'd love the way it works. So I'd love the look on its face is determined.

202
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:54,281
It's got the cork Scrooge nose, which it like, Dan said it it... Looks like it's pulling out of court, but the the funny part of it, just not pickle juice. It's it's air or something because it inflate like a balloon and that's that ga logic. I mean, I I like the bug. Yeah. I like it too. I I I think it's kinda cute.

203
00:23:55,494 --> 00:24:22,615
There is. It's it's very threatening working, but it's very funny. So so you guys, they are they've been looking in the vicinity of this old crap building it's called the Nick O'brien can't canon. Yeah. It must be the Mc mcbride Can comp. And there was there's an illusion at some point to have this is where they were first spot and they do start to find more and we get this little taste of some men

204
00:24:23,168 --> 00:24:32,380
Warren, do you wanna tell us about what the mysterious figure the old building does? Right. As the Inducks are are collecting more and more bugs they get closer to the building,

205
00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:36,411
a mysterious arm reaches out or hand reaches out with this cane

206
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,726
and and cracks the box open releasing all of the bugs

207
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:46,883
back into the patch. Right. And and the man, the unseen seen man acts like it was

208
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:49,512
mistake, like it was the accident.

209
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:53,632
Right? Mh And and will you see him looking on

210
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:57,715
as the docs go try and recover there insects.

211
00:24:58,567 --> 00:25:00,720
And we get this view of him.

212
00:25:01,517 --> 00:25:06,180
We we got a little set up for... We're we're gonna learn that this is Pj o'brien.

213
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:13,031
I don't know that we get his... Yeah. And he he mentions. It is I. Pj came Provide. Does he

214
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:14,739
Yeah.

215
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:22,654
Yep And we got we had reveal from his thought bloom balloon that he is the one who released these

216
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:23,730
terrible.

217
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:31,645
And and his plan, his home... His character Barks is motivation hearing you guys it's very silly.

218
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:37,434
Dan, do you do you wanna tell us what his plan is, he reveals oh, yeah. He

219
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:38,713
has a...

220
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:41,590
His Camry, he would pickle

221
00:25:42,064 --> 00:25:49,755
omega, but frankly, I I don't know if I've heard of before. I I don't know that I've Severino worn myself. Yeah. And it... It's it's really

222
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,724
he he really... It it's almost like

223
00:25:53,182 --> 00:25:56,435
mister Barks trying to block out the sun. You know, he wants to

224
00:25:56,813 --> 00:26:00,364
leash an army of bugs to just destroy all of the local pickles

225
00:26:00,664 --> 00:26:01,884
so that he can...

226
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:07,618
There will be no alternative, but for people to eat his root vegas. Right yeah. That's

227
00:26:08,037 --> 00:26:12,492
clear. That's the whole... That's the whole reason. He's unleashed this

228
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:13,789
play.

229
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:22,255
Supply there too does... You know he's got how many how many Barks? Twenty three three million four fifty years.

230
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:26,459
Huey, lose to having hands them back in nineteen

231
00:26:26,797 --> 00:26:29,689
twenty seven and you can't give them a away.

232
00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:38,928
So you know, the stakes in this one are are are both very high because it's like deadly

233
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:40,167
a deadly

234
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:51,869
infestation but also we wheels well. So so eventually, the kids do recover a lot of those bugs and they're on their way to give them to the scientist to sent them to this task.

235
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:54,860
And and again, out of nowhere,

236
00:26:55,238 --> 00:27:00,339
that man it it was he used his pain, which is gonna be kind of his signature.

237
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:06,611
Right? He wax the box of bugs out with his chain and

238
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:13,624
you know, it's very clear that it's on purpose to the that's this point. So Donald pursue them.

239
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:18,115
The Nephews kinda figuring out he's probably the smuggle

240
00:27:18,652 --> 00:27:19,152
himself

241
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,994
and that they need to go to the sciences and tell them, you know, what happened. But

242
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:31,114
They do have a little painful Scrooge of luck who warren you wanna tell us about it. Yeah. Yeah. It turns out that the

243
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:35,954
they wanna go back into the lab until the scientists what happened. And then bug... Actually,

244
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:44,777
the loan bug takes a stab at donald speak and they take that as an opportunity to box it up and, you know, bring it back to the scientists.

245
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:53,320
Right. So they've have this... They they've been success even it's just the single. And we we transitioned to the laboratory

246
00:27:53,696 --> 00:27:54,913
for bunch of serious

247
00:27:56,663 --> 00:27:58,641
there is a scientist who is

248
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:03,089
like, communicating it. He's he's spraying a pest side, and they're

249
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:18,267
indicating that their worse concern... Your worst Barks are met no known bug sprays will phase him They've got these great nineteen fifties masks on. You know? From that and it... It's in the Department of pathology. I I love the wall. Yeah.

250
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,617
The wall the

251
00:28:21,194 --> 00:28:21,694
fantastic.

252
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,620
Does does anyone know what the actual term is for the study Inducks?

253
00:28:27,114 --> 00:28:29,050
Off of the top your head and.

254
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,484
Yep. Ent technology, that's the one.

255
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:40,271
I love the little panel where the bug is just staring at the nephew. And it's just like raging Al him it's great. There's

256
00:28:40,647 --> 00:29:07,519
little that's funnier than a a very tiny creature roaring and snorkeling and a much bigger one. And so. But we see mc with me... They see Mc Mcbride actually appearing in the room from outside. He's got the over of there. Yeah. Right. Yeah. He's actually part of the whole operation and kind of kind of an inside job because he happens to be there they got a radio graham that arrived from mcdonald's on the upper

257
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,019
Amazon, which brings hope beyond

258
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:10,899
basically

259
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,233
that what stand do you wanna tell us about the hope that they've gotten...

260
00:29:15,611 --> 00:29:19,583
Yeah. It's what's it called a... The jungle razor wasp

261
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,109
is the predator they need

262
00:29:23,689 --> 00:29:28,304
to introduce to take care of the infestation of the

263
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:29,143
hit.

264
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:34,986
This reminds me dan of that classic up so from the the Simpsons where they go to Australia,

265
00:29:35,803 --> 00:29:36,622
and and

266
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,896
the continent gets overrun

267
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:54,305
with that animal that Barks brings, they have to, like, figure out a a sequence of progressively bigger animals to address it. The what was it that the came towed? Was it And it's... That's what I thought about and just each one they they introduced just

268
00:29:54,739 --> 00:30:05,834
creates more havoc than the than the last one, and then they have to try and... Yeah. Right. This is back in the fifties when when people thought that they could engineer the environment rather than just be.

269
00:30:06,211 --> 00:30:10,149
But, anyway, they figure out that they need to like, mountain next expedition with this

270
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:28,904
Brian guys working on the inside. And so he offers to go at his own expense, but of course, this would have been a delaying tactic. And and the scientist to say no, It's gotta be someone anonymous so this bug sm won't catch on. So that's gonna set up the dynamic for the rest of the story where we've got Donald the kid, having the opportunity to catch these wasp.

271
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:37,361
For for a thousand dollars rather than a nickel apiece for the pickle heaters. And of course, Mc O'brien is gonna be along for the ride to sabotage

272
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:42,881
Yeah. He's not... He's not too happy that they went to unknown rights. So you guys I really like the

273
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:51,643
transition to the Amazon. Pretty abrupt. You don't get like a traveling montage or anything like that? But as we transition, we get this just hilarious

274
00:30:51,982 --> 00:30:52,482
panel

275
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:59,603
definitely one of the stand out panels of this story that is is meant to convey what a dangerous region is it. Dan.

276
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:03,689
Dan, you mind describing that panel for us? Yeah. Just shows,

277
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:08,889
you know, just a picture of a River on the Amazon, and it's it's so

278
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:16,944
ferocious that the the animals seem to be eating each other crocodile is buying another crocodile house tail, and then three

279
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:21,194
bo constrict are tied around themselves almost

280
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,745
biting each other as if it were one of those

281
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:43,294
mythological creatures that that is, you know, like, time with it's twin brother and Right. And... Yeah, that's that's that's their way of getting across just how how wild the Amazon is. That it's so wild Dc creatures even even go after each other when I have nothing else to to get. It's so great.

282
00:31:43,912 --> 00:31:53,684
I love it. I I I... When I when I started somebody I saw it, Dan mentioned, the alligator elevator. That's the first thing you see, and then you see the bo constrict eating each other or by Ducktales.

283
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:58,714
And then if you look close, you see the monkeys kind of having that monkey fight upside out, which is my favorite

284
00:31:59,092 --> 00:32:10,140
thing. And then you take a look and you see the bird peck that alligator on the head while the insect is stinging. It looks like a rodent and door rat on the other. And then you see the little sword fight between the little

285
00:32:10,478 --> 00:32:10,797
sting.

286
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:14,760
Right middle of the panel. Just so much going on here and, you know,

287
00:32:15,677 --> 00:32:28,806
it it's just wonderful. One of my favorite panels and the little whole story. Yeah. It's it's great. It's one of those panels where you look at it the the longer you look at at the better gets. So you guys the next sequence is basically all about the duct forwarding the river

288
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:34,690
heading towards the place where those wasp are said to be there's some cool names like

289
00:32:35,068 --> 00:32:51,261
only this and so forth. They got the word. It's it's it's a direct rip off of the scene in in Barks app where there's native that's like communicating via bomb goes and he's learning from a group of people, called the

290
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,277
Inducks

291
00:32:52,557 --> 00:32:58,542
who live near who live near the past and have been Al saying that they know where to find a lot.

292
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:00,939
And and so Barks

293
00:33:00,998 --> 00:33:03,834
gives the docs that piece of information.

294
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:06,427
But then has their died run off

295
00:33:06,925 --> 00:33:07,985
because the

296
00:33:08,484 --> 00:33:08,984
Indian

297
00:33:09,642 --> 00:33:11,461
sleep danger. And then

298
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,554
the that's and heading towards that destination

299
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,994
which is all an excuse

300
00:33:18,374 --> 00:33:23,356
for the un seen pj j mcbride to engage in some Sabotage

301
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:28,154
on the way. So instead, I'm detailing every little bit of that sabotage.

302
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:36,278
Maybe I'll ask each of you to mention just one of the little parts that the little sabotage moments that you like Sure.

303
00:33:36,616 --> 00:33:48,994
You know, I think the the fact that pj But Brian is has access to the jungle way before they do his one thing. But again, you see the caine here, which I like it. You know, you know that that he's making his it is

304
00:33:49,454 --> 00:33:51,494
stealing the the beats, if you will,

305
00:33:52,428 --> 00:33:52,928
and

306
00:33:53,667 --> 00:34:06,974
that's the last time that they want that to happen, of course, the Inducks, and that that's funny, I think. Mh. Right. And every everywhere look. At some point, you know, he's he's, like, filled their food with castor oil.

307
00:34:07,994 --> 00:34:13,218
He has plants some mine in the river river wrecking bone

308
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:14,773
He's really s

309
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:23,563
who he lives memos in there in their canteen. Oh, yeah. And he even took the time to make rag dials out of their blanket. He actually took a scissors and made.

310
00:34:24,499 --> 00:34:26,054
To me, that was just great.

311
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,703
Right. Adding a little bit of insult to injury.

312
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,033
Yeah. And and so the... But probably

313
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,031
the

314
00:34:34,343 --> 00:34:38,231
most vicious thing Huey, does is is one of the cooler sequences

315
00:34:39,126 --> 00:34:46,656
which is that he you you wanna tell us about this this sequence stand. Yeah. He he he awakens some sleeping crocodile

316
00:34:46,993 --> 00:34:47,652
that are

317
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:53,370
around their boat and first he he he dropped a maybe a a a coconut

318
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,326
on Donald head,

319
00:34:55,824 --> 00:35:00,374
which serves the dual purpose of hurting him and making a loud noise.

320
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:02,963
Right. To wake up the crocodile

321
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:09,344
and and that just goes ahead and all he does is just take a a rifle or a shotgun

322
00:35:09,682 --> 00:35:15,194
and just fires it off like crazy just just and start the crocodile

323
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,374
to to to stampede them.

324
00:35:18,428 --> 00:35:39,640
Reminding their boat. He's more vicious here than I've ever seen to and any bill practically because he's actually in my opinion, was like he was trying to kill them. That's. That's how I'm reading it. Yeah. This really is like Barks nasty Go to and, you know, when you wants someone to be genuinely un redeem. This is what he does. And and I haven't even mentioned

325
00:35:39,977 --> 00:35:51,438
his, like really nasty lab that he's he does several times. Barks gives him this really, like very nasal like... Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how you say. I guess did you mind if I give it a shot? Yeah.

326
00:35:52,195 --> 00:35:54,387
I think it's more like yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

327
00:35:56,061 --> 00:35:58,912
Yeah. I think you're right. I think it's the classic nasal

328
00:35:59,544 --> 00:36:06,917
I think you nailed it. And and it's all in in service of selling is twenty three million terrible

329
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,454
ports Vegas.

330
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:16,693
So, you know, once he does this crocodile I stampede, which is really cool. This is a great. And I do love that Mh.

331
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:20,386
He is stolen the docks beads he has,

332
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:24,378
you know, the only means of barter with the the sticker...

333
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:29,303
Is that their name? The sticker Onions? Right. This the sticker ride beyond the.

334
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,217
The the sticker tribe. Yeah. So

335
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:40,299
bryant is looking good. He's he's pretty set. He's solid. But the debts are are just generally in trouble. They have to scatter or avoid some crocodile.

336
00:36:40,757 --> 00:37:09,564
And so be dragging and weary they climb out of the river onto this very suspicious looking dry rock to get their win so they can decide what they're gonna do. And you guys this where the story takes a little bit of a turn. Right? Because as as you mentioned, Dan, this is a very cool feature that is like nothing we've ever seen before in in this story or any other Barks? You wanna describe it for us dan? Yeah. The boys first refer to it as a lizard. It looks an awful lot like a

337
00:37:09,904 --> 00:37:10,404
tri.

338
00:37:11,344 --> 00:37:12,164
It's purple.

339
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:13,764
It's it's it's...

340
00:37:14,104 --> 00:37:17,938
You know, got a little bit of a combination of a Tri Top with the

341
00:37:18,316 --> 00:37:18,816
s,

342
00:37:19,632 --> 00:37:26,790
large ears that are almost like, like, the shape of an elephant. And I do kinda look like I'll see years I was kinda reminded of those, like,

343
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:35,247
it pro tops, the one that's kinda like tri, but with almost a f around? Mh but it it's I think it's definitely

344
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:37,801
supposed to be recognizable as a dinosaur,

345
00:37:38,259 --> 00:37:41,793
and it doesn't really look like any scientifically typically no

346
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:42,570
right? Mh.

347
00:37:43,704 --> 00:37:44,724
But it's a really

348
00:37:46,104 --> 00:37:48,084
it's very arm kind of

349
00:37:48,504 --> 00:37:49,004
pile.

350
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:54,376
And and the you know, they they awaken very startled obviously.

351
00:37:55,355 --> 00:38:00,304
And they find that they can't really move because the future looks of issues, but they're

352
00:38:00,923 --> 00:38:13,465
possession on its Barks so that he can't get them. And so they decide to just write it out because he's headed of the way that they wanna go. This is very much reminiscent of what happened in the in Barks Africa

353
00:38:14,004 --> 00:38:25,501
where they were on their way to, like, a valley and they ended up on the Barks of them. Dan, you mentioned that it's this was an elephant in a previous story that Barks has remade basically.

354
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:34,372
So you guys were approaching the sequence where we counter the sticker Inducks. This is definitely a little off putting. Right? Because we're gonna one of these very pate

355
00:38:35,028 --> 00:38:45,945
depictions of of of a Amazon and arrive. Lauren, do you wanna tell us what Brian gets up to? Well, first of all, he he holds up a picture of the wasp and he, and they're certainly familiar with it

356
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,660
It is kinda of funny when they say You betcha.

357
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,140
That's Al that's a Minnesota term, I guess, I would say. Right? And

358
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:57,121
So he he... And then they referred to it as the the fellow.

359
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:06,607
But they know that they are the natural enemy of the pickle haters, and so they're aware of that. So Mc o'brien has found or he thinks he has found the right, you know, native

360
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:15,081
population to go after for him. But when he offers some beads, he goes no deal. I'm not gonna take care. They're not gonna take the beats because

361
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:24,439
the wasp spends the winter in, and then we're introduced to the Forbidden Valley there. And the beautiful view, of beautiful artwork there and they don't go there

362
00:39:24,816 --> 00:39:29,703
for all the beads in Brazil. That that's kinda funny. But, yeah. No. Mc brian's

363
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:47,795
at least for now, he's he's kind of, you know, you know, he has to make a tough to decision here. He's in a bit of a pickle. He's in bit above. And that was another thing too. Pj, they Pickle juice. Pickle Juice mc mcbride. I mean, that's also came up with. So I... Yeah. That's that's exactly what I was thinking. Right? Okay pulls

364
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:50,795
pickles are bronze and you yeah

365
00:39:51,535 --> 00:39:52,355
be pickle

366
00:39:54,095 --> 00:39:56,449
Dan what did you think of this very

367
00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:03,632
depiction of the quote sticker Inducks. Well, I don't know if it was earlier, but I found interesting that

368
00:40:04,385 --> 00:40:06,163
they have one native group

369
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:13,116
go searching for another native group and native group a is almost like four and eight group b.

370
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:26,610
First natives are, like, more, I guess, assimilated into the general population And... Right. Yeah. They're guy. Yeah. Most Mo. Yeah. What that we. Oh, the they're they're they're fearful of

371
00:40:26,989 --> 00:41:05,335
tribe. They're completely wild to the tribe. They... Right. So it's a good storytelling technique because it increases the fear, it rashes it ratchet up the dr. It doesn't really hold up well in terms of how we understand the these groups to be, but... But it is a classic storytelling technique. So our dreadful villain brine, nor off away from the village. And then kinda has the epiphany that Huey, doesn't actually need to catch the wasp. All he needs to do is prevent the Inducks or anyone else from getting to them. So basically, does that by commissioning the locals using beads. Very condescending,

372
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:08,085
everything about them is very pate,

373
00:41:08,463 --> 00:41:10,497
You know, they talk in a very childish manner.

374
00:41:11,255 --> 00:41:14,723
I appreciate warren that you didn't like read their dialogue

375
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,838
like Them jumbo.

376
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:19,951
And like, why are they speaking english obviously?

377
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:25,017
Right right. So anyway, you can miss them to attack the Inducks on with arrows.

378
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:29,473
And he thinks he has he thinks he's got it made.

379
00:41:30,012 --> 00:41:37,885
And then Al the that step close to Forbidden Al, they they came themselves that they need to

380
00:41:38,425 --> 00:41:39,805
actually call the

381
00:41:40,305 --> 00:41:46,020
for a help seems like a little bit of a weird plot, you guys, that all of a sudden are not really fearful

382
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:46,940
of this.

383
00:41:47,320 --> 00:42:05,035
Oh, especially when their their former guide had worn them about that them. And so I I find it Al little bit hard to swallow. But you know, it's... It's it's a team to make them aware that they're there. Right. So, of course, the only thing that saves them from this trap. Is the

384
00:42:05,615 --> 00:42:19,643
and and O'brien are rightfully fully terrified what they call. A dragon lizard from forbidden theft So right they just all kept and run. Guys, this is a pretty cool sequence I sure wouldn't blame anyone for being

385
00:42:19,982 --> 00:42:21,681
afraid of this genuinely

386
00:42:21,995 --> 00:42:28,295
training feature. Well I Also just say I I did Al little research on the term Dragon and Lizard, and there is that

387
00:42:28,595 --> 00:42:32,030
one real existing animal where it has that sort of bill

388
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,610
by thermometer?

389
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:40,625
You have the monitor kind of or the Yeah. And so it's... It it... But they... There it's a reptile known as Dragon

390
00:42:41,585 --> 00:43:03,120
Are not found in South America. They're in Australia and Asia they. But that's okay. I mean, I take it is just like that. That's just the sort of the Indian lingo. Right? That kind of like a bug you know, native of speak. Most. Yeah. Yeah. You're. I never thought of it that way, but that that makes sense now that they would have just put those words together. Yeah. Yeah. That's fine

391
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:03,700
Okay.

392
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:10,200
But a great animal. I'd like Dan said earlier just the design and the

393
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:12,968
introducing elements of of other pre

394
00:43:13,306 --> 00:43:17,873
reptile, I think, is is really fascinated Right. How do you think dan? But those

395
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:20,067
both and arrows that that

396
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:28,520
Mc O'brien tells them to use against it. To clearly I have no effect on it. Oh, I thought it was funny when Nick Mcbride. After that fails, he

397
00:43:29,195 --> 00:43:30,535
says... But by Vinegar,

398
00:43:30,915 --> 00:43:33,175
I'll see that you never delivered them.

399
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:36,955
I thought the by vinegar was a pretty funny, pretty funny phrase.

400
00:43:37,967 --> 00:43:53,140
It is. It's it's very them manic consistent. He's a a pickle man through and through or at least a pickle be man. Now we might mention that the creatures is basically like Al already made fork, which keeps them safe from the bows arrows. But again,

401
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:56,210
Mcbride is is real dillon. He

402
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:10,825
they may have gotten through into the valley that they gone through. That is a classic lost value. Guys we got. So we've got one way and one way out, we've got this really tight little ecosystem, and he threatens them human metal

403
00:44:11,139 --> 00:44:19,455
you pests. And I can't seem to stop you from getting to the wasp. But my vinegar see that you never deliver them. As the line you mentioned and

404
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:34,057
step on there he's he's gonna stop. He wants to kill him. No idea. We get that nasal villain laugh again. And so they enter the valley. Dan Tell us about their first view of. Well, it's a lot bigger than it looked from the outside.

405
00:44:34,554 --> 00:44:36,370
Got some just dinosaurs.

406
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:37,806
Bro

407
00:44:38,302 --> 00:44:38,802
and

408
00:44:39,955 --> 00:44:40,455
some

409
00:44:41,235 --> 00:44:44,135
tea wrecked and little s sources.

410
00:44:45,035 --> 00:44:46,150
They're they're all just

411
00:44:47,129 --> 00:45:05,483
They look fairly peaceful. Not the... I mean, they're they're they're spa a little bit, but it's nothing like with the the bo constrict and the alligator in that one previous panel. That's true. It's it's less violent than the quote regular animal. So you guys the the thing that makes that always

412
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:24,404
makes me sad about this trope which which I love. I I am a dinosaur movie guy. I love lost Al. I love the whole idea of them. Filled with Flo and fauna lost to time. But but the sad thing is that they just... They fall apart under scrutiny.

413
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:26,558
If you know anything about biology

414
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,171
and environment and ecosystems,

415
00:45:29,544 --> 00:45:31,399
There's just no way that,

416
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:33,926
you know, a small Al

417
00:45:34,723 --> 00:45:35,223
or,

418
00:45:35,758 --> 00:45:52,890
like, a lost island like Skull island in in the King Kong universe could support the kind of mega fan that I just I just love to see in this kind of story So it ultimately just makes me a little bit sad that this thing is is is

419
00:45:54,070 --> 00:46:02,305
There's just no getting around the fact that it's total nonsense. Yeah. But as far as forbidden Al go this sum... The the do counters

420
00:46:02,805 --> 00:46:22,460
and encounter with the dinosaur is pretty awesome that this scene. I'll I'll tell you guys. I I remember this story with a lot of fun. This. And I was I was really looking forward to revisiting it. And and when I went back to this scene, I was I was a little bit let down. I'm I I I had to kinda take a back and think to myself, you know, since reading this, originally, I've watched

421
00:46:23,478 --> 00:46:26,629
jurassic Park movies and this and that. Oh.

422
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:42,645
So we're this this really is still pretty spectacular just despite what I said. Ted tell us about the encounter with the T rack. But well, the whole sequence leading up to up to the close ups shots, so is... Is probably some of the three or four best arch pages that Carl Barks.

423
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:48,387
Created for this story. I think he had a blast drawing these. So moving into the Forbidden

424
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:50,182
Valley into that wonderful

425
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:54,821
which, you know, it's funny you said that because I had a memory of this panel being a lot bigger,

426
00:46:55,237 --> 00:46:57,729
and it it isn't, but it's it's still wonderful.

427
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,415
But then as they they move through,

428
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:04,762
the Inducks want to do everything to dis mount, they're armor,

429
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:10,520
the bearing animal, they're taxi, if you will, to get off. And then, of course, we see the

430
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:11,796
the der

431
00:47:12,692 --> 00:47:14,987
beautifully drawn very traditional

432
00:47:15,404 --> 00:47:18,196
going after them. So it's just a wonderful sequence.

433
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:19,269
Savage

434
00:47:19,726 --> 00:47:21,462
and escape and

435
00:47:22,478 --> 00:47:27,143
just the Ducktales surviving. You know, it's it's almost amazing that they did survive. Yeah.

436
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:33,205
Dan, what do you think of this Dinosaur... The the rack sequence?? Yeah. I I liked it.

437
00:47:33,663 --> 00:47:56,436
It's just it's very clear what he's doing because every kid who knows about dinosaurs knows about the rex. It's kinda like the first major dinosaur you learn about. And it just sticks with us all the way through adult. So the t rex is just always symbolizes just like danger and and ferocity, and it's gonna kill you. How are you suggesting that he's hand to his kid readers here?

438
00:47:57,091 --> 00:48:04,071
I am. Yeah. Yeah. I the the t rex always the bad boy, the Dinosaur pack, you know, the... Yeah. Leather jacket

439
00:48:04,611 --> 00:48:23,376
Hood Yeah. Mh. Mh. Yeah. Like like Al all honesty for a story where the payoff is a valley full of dinosaurs. We don't really spend all that much time with them. To be honest. You gotta hit this with the t reps right away. And it's it's it's a pretty cool attack and as you say warren it's it's pretty

440
00:48:23,796 --> 00:48:29,376
narrow escape. They hide in a in a hollow tree that seems very sturdy. And

441
00:48:29,996 --> 00:48:40,495
unfortunately, for the die, and and conveniently for the story because Barks seems to want to wrap it up. You you may have had a count here the the three

442
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:46,348
is full of some loss, which do turn out to be the razor wasp. And Al

443
00:48:47,067 --> 00:48:53,255
as the t rex bash into treating it flushed out and they attack the t rex and

444
00:48:53,834 --> 00:48:58,699
donald comments, those wasp there's so tough they make even dinosaurs

445
00:48:59,395 --> 00:48:59,895
scout

446
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:10,251
and and I'll say it's not the most anatomical correct looking drawing or the T reps. The bottom right one there with the the t mask kind sleep in.

447
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:11,631
But again, Al

448
00:49:12,271 --> 00:49:18,172
has come long way since nineteen fifty seven. And he's from my wasp as well. So

449
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,073
it was definitely in line with, like,

450
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,167
one million bc.

451
00:49:24,782 --> 00:49:24,862
Yeah.

452
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:30,556
I guess that would have been a little later wouldn't it. I'm trying to think of the old re house

453
00:49:31,212 --> 00:49:33,902
dinosaur room. Yeah that was about sixty nine or seventy

454
00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:41,099
that was in that area. Yeah. Al of the Gu, was that that around this time? I don't know. That's a good question.

455
00:49:41,637 --> 00:49:44,626
So, anyway, we've got an neat little sequence where Donald

456
00:49:45,961 --> 00:49:49,648
tell us about the resolution work. Well, you know, the the the wasp

457
00:49:49,985 --> 00:49:54,809
seem to be gathering in a bunch here So his strategy was to take the

458
00:49:55,268 --> 00:49:59,804
the box that they've been carrying in his hat. He had it under his hat. And to...

459
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:18,833
I'd love the paddle where they look at him in anger almost, but he's got this look at his face as the these stared them down. He's staring down the bugs the Wasp rather. And then he leaves out, and catches all of them in... But what he thinks is all of them in that box closes it quickly. And then, of course, we get another loan bug that that gets him.

460
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:36,801
We get we get a a literal comic sting. Tom sting nicely put. Yes. Yeah. That little sequence, I I could really imagine Barks doing in his time as an animated, you know, story board artist. It felt like one of his cartoon doing story Barks in the early days yes.

461
00:50:37,416 --> 00:50:46,920
And then, Dan, you wanna tell us about the sequence where the nephews figure out the thing with the sound and how they use it for their escape from Forbidden Valley? They they they take

462
00:50:47,498 --> 00:50:48,238
they fashion

463
00:50:48,617 --> 00:50:53,567
tools where they use the the wasp that make a wasp like sound.

464
00:50:53,986 --> 00:50:55,606
But they... They're bow

465
00:50:57,067 --> 00:51:01,021
that sound like giant Boss in order to scare off the dinosaurs,

466
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:05,641
you know, they're they're... They're terrified of these little insects.

467
00:51:06,681 --> 00:51:11,756
Right. They're very very afraid of them Have you... You were you guys familiar with bull?

468
00:51:12,376 --> 00:51:17,396
No. I wasn't. I did a little research and they are they are this, I guess, handmade made

469
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:31,422
tool or... What would you call it, Barks? I had... It's a it it it simulate the loud roaring buzz of a deep deeper, and I've I've heard them, but I can probably call it an ancient rich music.

470
00:51:32,637 --> 00:51:38,381
Just off the top of my head, not not consulting with wikipedia or anything that. Yeah. Like, almost a spiritual

471
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:57,707
sound that would either call the spirits or or Yeah. Apparently it was using a lot of ancient. That that's pretty neat. That was definitely the the thing I learned from this story. Pretty creative solution. Yeah. I was big they would reference the junior Wood chuck guide, book but they didn't. But I figured that's sure they got from anyway, maybe. Who knows?

472
00:51:58,483 --> 00:52:13,339
Yeah. Seems like a missed opportunity you. So basically, as you might fact what they're doing with these bull aurora is circling behind all the animals of the valley and and gradually trying to lead them towards the past. So they start to flush the dinosaurs

473
00:52:13,678 --> 00:52:16,854
out toward the entrance exit of the valley.

474
00:52:17,353 --> 00:52:26,129
And and Barks does this do neat perspective switch here where he takes this out to Mc Mcbride who's just waiting out at the past.

475
00:52:26,507 --> 00:52:31,701
Just wicked mu over his next step when the dust come out. Now we get an ominous

476
00:52:32,161 --> 00:52:32,661
rum.

477
00:52:33,081 --> 00:52:41,911
And we've get the big stand out panel of this story. Probably the one that most people are are gonna remember if they think back

478
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,663
on this story, it it is the Dinosaur

479
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,540
stampede.

480
00:52:46,157 --> 00:52:46,657
Where

481
00:52:47,153 --> 00:52:53,927
as Mcbride says, this is the most and, you know, you you can't go wrong

482
00:52:54,344 --> 00:52:55,840
with a dinosaur stampede.

483
00:52:56,736 --> 00:53:09,706
As as far as an action set piece goes, it's it's hard to disappoint your reader with something like this. As one of my favorite panels again, we're getting back to his love of drawing these dinosaurs and where we saw them in that Do Valley.

484
00:53:10,006 --> 00:53:20,837
Now we're seeing them in this great splash panel where they're they're just running and and stamped and and and we get to see the scale. I don't know if it's accurate of Mc Bryant to them, but

485
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:35,067
it's just very dramatic. And you keep hearing the buzz of the you know in the background. I think it's just absolutely fabulous drawn. Yeah. What do you think Dan? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they're absolutely panicked I I enjoy seeing

486
00:53:35,643 --> 00:53:36,382
the s.

487
00:53:37,357 --> 00:53:38,734
It's one of my favorite dinosaurs.

488
00:53:39,828 --> 00:53:41,444
Always has been. And

489
00:53:41,995 --> 00:53:48,439
But, yeah, the the the dinosaurs have just... It's funny because real life dinosaurs so to speak.

490
00:53:49,431 --> 00:53:50,851
Wouldn't look as

491
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:57,091
Al. Like, the the the the faces on these dinosaurs look worried and troubled

492
00:53:57,471 --> 00:54:02,306
and showing like pressing. Right? Yeah. Yeah... They're not just

493
00:54:02,846 --> 00:54:10,917
running in on auto pilot. I mean, they're looking back at the bugs they they clearly are intelligent enough to

494
00:54:11,296 --> 00:54:25,829
follow them. They see... Follow the bugs with their eyes, they look just just downright scared and human like what what what people would look like if they were afraid. Right. A little less, like, animal than you might sometimes drop. You guys are...

495
00:54:26,248 --> 00:54:30,305
You guys I remember when I read this one, I compared it favorably

496
00:54:30,724 --> 00:54:33,934
in in my kid head. So the similar scene from

497
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,982
Where it's this massive elephant stampede

498
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:41,889
instead. And it is just the t, right? That dinosaurs

499
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:45,898
and a dinosaur stampede is inherently cooler

500
00:54:46,357 --> 00:54:53,185
than an elephant stampede. So, like, for me, mentally, it just it just stood out that naturally the dinosaur

501
00:54:53,522 --> 00:54:57,212
must have been much cooler much better than the elephant arc. But

502
00:54:57,749 --> 00:55:01,439
now now that I look at it in the context of doing this

503
00:55:02,111 --> 00:55:08,911
doing this podcast and just with the knowing a little bit more about line work and comic Barks.

504
00:55:09,525 --> 00:55:12,981
It it's pretty undeniable that the elephant stampede peed

505
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:13,820
is

506
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:14,699
vastly

507
00:55:15,517 --> 00:55:22,015
superior our in terms of at least to the drawing the the artistic skill. Then the Dinosaur one

508
00:55:22,712 --> 00:55:41,746
it's definitely worth taking a moment here to show you if if it doesn't take too long. I'll have to look it up later too. I would love to compare the the stories. First I'll go back after the... This episode recording and and review Barks stafford again, as as I said earlier out here. This is handy. I'm gonna just share this with you guys right now. I found

509
00:55:42,286 --> 00:55:44,326
someone is set up a little side by side.

510
00:55:45,286 --> 00:55:49,966
Of course, it's the guy It's it's Geo x from the dot comic review,

511
00:55:50,646 --> 00:56:08,386
which a great blog about Disney comics, mostly a lot of barb and other stuff. So his dot com reviewed. He's got a little side by side comparing the two panels. Bear with me jen, and I will send this over in through the chat. Oh, wow. Oh, yeah. Making it a little bigger.

512
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,717
So so look at that.

513
00:56:10,594 --> 00:56:13,207
My I'm gonna say again, the the

514
00:56:13,864 --> 00:56:26,057
the artwork and from in africa is just to me now it looks dramatically superior. But what what do you think we're on? I'll I'll take a stab at it first. I fault... I've I've seen this comparison for the first time

515
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:32,852
and I totally agree that the Elephant stampede has so much more drama so much more action

516
00:56:33,229 --> 00:56:44,788
and I love the depth of field of the of the horizon it goes all the way back and you've got... You've got this data on it just both are are dramatic, but... You can't compare the two though the stampede is

517
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:57,475
superior. Dan I know you haven't encountered the other story before, but what's your impression of it? No. I agree with you guys, and it's It's much more scary than the dinosaurs dinosaurs almost look feeble.

518
00:56:58,251 --> 00:57:00,346
Yeah. In comparison to the elephants.

519
00:57:00,843 --> 00:57:18,342
Yeah. They kinda look a little bit tooth plus little harmless. The the elephants are really are much more much more imposing which more intimidating. So yeah, Don't give me wrong. It's still a very cool sequence but Barks was clearly going back to the well for this one. But I will say both in both cases,

520
00:57:19,518 --> 00:57:22,391
the animals the reptile and the elephants,

521
00:57:22,931 --> 00:57:50,876
the dinosaurs, they have absolutely no regard for the figure in front. They are stating they they really don't care what happens and Al, of course, in in Forbidden Valley, that's the last scene we see in Forbidden Valley is that big splash panel. Before we see a little bit of a time jump. Right. Yeah. Let's let's go for it. Let's go ahead and wrap this up because we transition to the Ducktales having successfully gotten the wasp and they allude to Mc Mcbride being trapped in the hospital

522
00:57:51,176 --> 00:58:03,191
back in Q Vista. But clearly against Ducktales orders, he has at the end smashed his way out of his hospital room to follow them and and use that cane one last time

523
00:58:03,768 --> 00:58:06,001
to knock the wasp out of that box.

524
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:13,589
And just generally be a jerk. And warren you wanna wrap it up for us, talk about Brian's celebratory dinner Absolutely.

525
00:58:14,048 --> 00:58:17,119
Bandages and all, but Brian is now in the restaurant

526
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:24,161
with a fancy waiter, and and he's he's ready to order a good meal. He wants the finest meal that they have at the restaurant.

527
00:58:24,536 --> 00:58:31,136
That the the image is so funny anyway just with him all bandage up. But he's he's he's claiming victory. That's the key.

528
00:58:31,711 --> 00:58:32,211
And

529
00:58:32,671 --> 00:58:35,911
they have these great appetizers he wants something z.

530
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:41,091
He puts it in his mouth says it's absolutely horrible. Just this great on his face

531
00:58:41,445 --> 00:58:46,015
turns out that it's a pickle route Vegas in Your. And core of cover

532
00:58:46,832 --> 00:58:48,529
his he's disgusting

533
00:58:49,441 --> 00:58:54,501
And he he he realizes that this is what he wanted, but I... He didn't realize that they were

534
00:58:54,921 --> 00:58:57,140
a botched batch. I love that line

535
00:58:57,441 --> 00:58:59,156
Yeah. So he...

536
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,676
Again, again his bandages

537
00:59:01,176 --> 00:59:10,051
runs away from the table. And there he is. He's after those those wasp. Donald can't stand it anymore. But he says, no. No. I'm I'm

538
00:59:10,431 --> 00:59:22,940
I'm not doing any more damage, guys. I'm here to help you catch the wasp. So that's the closing panel is he's joining them now to you could care less about his twenty three million jars of right. Because it's the very

539
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,471
or it's not much of Al. Like it's gonna be a market

540
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:28,868
market flop clearly.

541
00:59:29,687 --> 00:59:31,585
So so, you know, that's that's

542
00:59:32,204 --> 00:59:38,076
kinda reminiscent of the end of in Barks africa where there's like, a little bit of a

543
00:59:38,896 --> 00:59:43,051
between the Ducktales and the huge jerk that's been

544
00:59:43,669 --> 00:59:50,314
in competition with them again over an insect in in in Barks africa was a a very rare butterfly,

545
00:59:50,891 --> 00:59:54,602
But. Yeah. Definitely Al lot peril between these two stories

546
00:59:55,261 --> 01:00:07,394
deliberate. So so that's it. That's the end... It's it's a bit of a silly It's not the strongest ending to my eye. What did you think of the conclusion there dan? It was really

547
01:00:07,852 --> 01:00:08,211
abrupt.

548
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:11,526
And I remember in the other one, I read,

549
01:00:12,225 --> 01:00:13,886
they Big Taught Bed.

550
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:14,946
Mh.

551
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,333
The villain, you know, we get... We get more of a

552
01:00:19,831 --> 01:00:33,749
that comes over to the right side. We get a... We get a a little bit more, like, a few panels of that story. This is literally just two panels. You have to... Like, one has to be able to infer that he's catching the wasp

553
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:34,988
in order.

554
01:00:35,367 --> 01:00:38,025
It just says I'm I'm gonna help you catch the wall. It doesn't

555
01:00:38,524 --> 01:00:44,388
infer in any way that the reason he wants to catch the wasp is So they can after Al have them

556
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:45,464
get the

557
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:46,757
the heaters.

558
01:00:47,395 --> 01:00:49,946
This one just be very abrupt.

559
01:00:50,559 --> 01:01:34,625
I agree with you. It did strike me as very abrupt It says satisfying in a way because, you know, it's as silly as the whole overall setup is. So it's proportionate to that. But it's ultimately kind of a small scale story for one that involves like a a hidden Al full of dinosaurs. That's a good way to describe it, Mark. I would say the same thing. I when I finished this, remembering some of these wonderful... The artwork and the panels. And, again, I hadn't really red Barks Africa, but it just seemed like a a mediocre story. It was just it it was okay. I would I wouldn't call it great. Yeah. And clearly, it's time to give our overall thoughts and reflections as you have been warren. I agree. I was I was just a little bit disappointed in this one. I'm I think it's a find story.

560
01:01:35,563 --> 01:01:41,017
I Think it's a perfectly serviceable Barks story, but maybe it's just some of the that down from

561
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:46,856
my memories of this one as a kid. I still enjoyed it, but I I was definitely

562
01:01:47,234 --> 01:01:50,764
surprised because I expected it to compare favorably

563
01:01:51,182 --> 01:01:52,175
to to

564
01:01:52,592 --> 01:02:00,761
Barks Africa, which honestly is like some really unfortunately vicious stereotypes and and is probably wanna bark most

565
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:02,919
means spirited

566
01:02:03,418 --> 01:02:08,233
Adventure stories. And is just one that I I generally felt a bit uncomfortable

567
01:02:08,732 --> 01:02:18,110
returning to but like like the sticker certainly not handled the best in this, but they're not... They're definitely less offensive character and the overt

568
01:02:18,649 --> 01:02:19,149
can

569
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:20,507
locals

570
01:02:20,926 --> 01:02:23,623
in that one. That one, I think has aged

571
01:02:24,042 --> 01:02:24,542
particularly

572
01:02:24,895 --> 01:02:44,557
poorly for Barks stories. But... But, again, I I I was surprised to find that I I do think now that it compares favorably to this one. Just at least in terms of the overall art and story. But I I do still enjoy this one it's always a treat to c dinosaurs like, you know, you know, especially Al earlier depiction of dinosaurs

573
01:02:44,934 --> 01:02:55,791
before jurassic Barks change the whole game, it's just necessarily gonna look like a little bit of a time capsule. Since that just totally altered how we think of them. What about you, dan? Yeah. I mean, it was enjoyable.

574
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:58,711
The other couple of ones that you've had me read,

575
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:00,606
I liked a little bit better

576
01:03:01,066 --> 01:03:10,857
I never thought about what you said where he was just convinced that his his Rh vegas would be a flop. I just kinda got the idea almost like I'd... Life's not worth

577
01:03:11,314 --> 01:03:33,838
living without, like, a good pickle. You know, like, Right. Here's I make money if there's no pickles around eat. I think your take is probably right think that's supposed to be the comic beat, sort of a silly. Oh, no. They're so gross. What if I done? I was just gonna say if there's one redeeming quality to the story and that's the introduction of Angus Mc wine starring Al pj j Nick O'brien.

578
01:03:34,795 --> 01:03:49,061
And this over the top Villain. I mean, who's ridiculously funny. You use the word solely. That's exactly how I describe the ending. I described the beginning. Some of the sequences as Silly. So there's this comedy, then you bring in this

579
01:03:49,401 --> 01:03:49,901
incredible

580
01:03:50,401 --> 01:03:54,961
adventure and this lost world references. So it's really lot going on here.

581
01:03:55,775 --> 01:04:10,092
Maybe a little dis, but but I... But I do... I think Mc O'brien is the redeeming quality to the story for me. Yeah. Like that, how you referred to him as now. Her that that is kind of the way to think of him. Right? He's almost like a featured player

582
01:04:10,628 --> 01:04:16,976
who's mixed wine as so and so. Definitely a notable character creation and lot

583
01:04:17,276 --> 01:04:24,471
creators are gonna go on to use him. So you guys we've kinda covered our perspective on this stan, you've you're a newbie. So, you know, you're

584
01:04:24,851 --> 01:04:44,536
necessarily gonna have kind of a different perspective on the. I do always try to be conscious of the fact that every story is someone's favorite. So... So, like, there there's certainly a lot to like about this when I don't wanna sound too down on it. And as a kid, I remember really enjoying the Hey, I think worry your about right. You know, this is pretty much an average

585
01:04:44,872 --> 01:04:55,711
fine Barks story And if we check Inducks, we're fans and users can rate these story, as well as get lots of very useful information for their hypothetical podcast

586
01:04:56,329 --> 01:05:06,336
We'll find that this story has a seven point six out of ten, which is good as of now for number two hundred and twelve out of all forty two thousand some

587
01:05:06,676 --> 01:05:20,291
stories that are rated. And of course, the Barks stories get. They're they're usually positioned well near the top. And if you break out all of the Barks adventure stories and look at it compared to those, it falls pretty much in the middle of all of those. Okay.

588
01:05:21,051 --> 01:05:28,286
As you might expect. Was gonna ask you that, I'm glad you you mentioned that because I know you've done your research to kinda break them apart from that whole index

589
01:05:29,186 --> 01:05:47,557
my very very ne success Oh, I I think it's wonderful, but I think that's where it would fall in the middle because they have some high points, I wanna say it has any low points But the fact that he did kinda repeat the story from Africa One element that makes you think that I'm gonna try it different and I'm gonna try some new

590
01:05:47,910 --> 01:06:03,116
newer phenomena, like dinosaurs to to get the kids in this time. So, yeah, I think there's a telling here. It's okay, but it's... I mean, I I would actually say that it has a few low points. I mean, there's no some There's some parts that feel a little bit per fun a little brief. Yeah.

591
01:06:04,116 --> 01:06:08,571
Some stuff favorites it's seems like it happens because it's just supposed to happen.

592
01:06:08,971 --> 01:06:14,243
It always bothers me when characters don't bog and just express amazement at seeing dinosaurs.

593
01:06:14,621 --> 01:06:23,959
Right. Like sure the Inducks were impressed, but I feel like I need a little bit more conversation. From the junior wood Barks about how we're we're the first Inducks to see real dinosaurs

594
01:06:24,338 --> 01:06:37,679
etcetera. I missed that too, by the way. I I had a note here on my my my notepad that said, were they not overwhelmed at the right person living humans to ever lay their eyes in score. I guess we're being

595
01:06:38,178 --> 01:06:38,678
pate

596
01:06:39,137 --> 01:06:41,110
now because, of course, the the sticker

597
01:06:41,669 --> 01:06:49,781
Would have been the first to see them. But but the first outsiders. Right? I Al I can think of is it's just overall, he felt a little bit rushed. You know, he needed the crutch.

598
01:06:50,235 --> 01:06:53,036
Of doing a remake for whatever reason around this time.

599
01:06:53,755 --> 01:07:02,941
I could used a few more pages of the valley itself, you know? That's the big draw this for. I'd say like the art in the river traveling sequence, the

600
01:07:03,399 --> 01:07:11,849
was was pretty cool. It was nice, but I don't think I needed so much of sequence compared to, like, spending more time in the Al itself. So

601
01:07:12,306 --> 01:07:16,448
I think we're we're just about ready to wrap up. Couple couple more things.

602
01:07:17,145 --> 01:07:21,316
I I I'll note that this this has never been adapted to duck

603
01:07:21,654 --> 01:07:30,318
other than the fact that Ducktales is definitely had sort of dinosaur lost valleys. Of course, as we mentioned, other creators have used mixed wines

604
01:07:30,697 --> 01:07:32,156
many many times

605
01:07:33,109 --> 01:07:36,122
Don Rosa did do a a pretty notable

606
01:07:36,779 --> 01:07:39,792
direct sequel to this one. You kinda tied it together

607
01:07:40,105 --> 01:07:50,150
with an element from a spice detail, but was mostly a sequel to this one. I believe was a pretty late story of his. And and Rosa

608
01:07:50,688 --> 01:07:51,188
really

609
01:07:51,887 --> 01:07:54,026
kinda leaned into the dinosaur

610
01:07:54,444 --> 01:08:13,180
stuff, which I think was a good decision. Boy I reread that in advance this one. I found that one a little bit tonal weird. To be honest it's not one of my favorites of his, but it did do some really cool like, king kong referencing and stuff. He he clearly had a lot of fun with the dinosaur aspect of it and some references.

611
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,115
Does that anyone have a favorite panels that

612
01:08:16,533 --> 01:08:24,417
that they didn't get common on that you'd like to highlight. There are two panels that we didn't really comment on that I I do like and the one is mix wine

613
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:40,835
staring at twenty three million quarts of pickled Root to vegas because I I just... I just love the visual there. It's like the wine seller that he should have, but he's Gottfredson bag is in there. The other one that I really did like, and you talked about the boys not and the that's just not being odd by the dinosaurs, but they

614
01:08:41,190 --> 01:09:18,974
when they discover them when they go through the Al, and then you see the two nephews, I love the two nephews are just kind of opposite one. This is colossal being in Lost world with Dinosaurs. There's the wonder. And then I just love the other one. I'm just too scared to enjoy. And I love the look on his face. So that's It's a little panel, but it it says a lot. Warren I'm glad you mentioned that Can panel. I think it's a good on to highlight even in this story of a lost world filled with a Dinosaur. There's a couple of really nice storytelling touches in it. You know, first, it's got, like, cob webs, spiders indicating how long it's been kind of moth. And the isles are listed

615
01:09:19,552 --> 01:09:26,847
twenty two a. Twenty four a know, if if the aisle have both numbers and letters, that's giving us an idea, Just we up fast,

616
01:09:27,504 --> 01:09:28,004
warehouse

617
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:29,637
full sold,

618
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:32,528
disgusting really the yeah. So

619
01:09:33,266 --> 01:09:40,412
neat story to me by heart. I'm gonna go with one of the really obvious panels even though we did talk about it. But that that panel with the wildlife

620
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:46,975
fighting itself is just hilarious. And I love it. How about you, dan? Did any panels catch your eye? Let's see.

621
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:48,448
The one where

622
01:09:49,145 --> 01:09:50,683
they're standing on a branch

623
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:51,680
and

624
01:09:52,058 --> 01:09:54,634
the rex first grabs that branch

625
01:09:55,664 --> 01:10:03,156
to eat them. It was it was a little scary. It it almost looks like he's going to chop bit by bit at that brand.

626
01:10:03,969 --> 01:10:04,469
Until

627
01:10:05,048 --> 01:10:08,704
the the the Ducktales on the end of the of, and

628
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:12,593
they just fall into his mouth and he me choose them to pieces.

629
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:21,106
I agree. I'm really glad you chose that one because that that is like a really good one. Maybe one of the scariest panels that Barks is done in in some time.

630
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:42,993
Excellent. Well, gentlemen, I think we've covered this really effectively, so I I really appreciate having having both of you join me. I hope listeners will come back as next time we get to cover the fantastic river race And, you know, check this out on the socials, Facebook and Instagram under Bark remarks. Keep an eye out

631
01:10:43,412 --> 01:10:44,730
because in a couple of months,

632
01:10:45,343 --> 01:10:47,836
sister podcast Rosa remarks

633
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:54,348
will be starting up covering in a similar manner many of the Don Rosa stories.

634
01:10:54,805 --> 01:10:56,063
And we've mostly

635
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:18,835
as long as I don't forget to do it, been closing out to the episode by reading the dialogue from the very last panel. So Dan, if you don't mind going there, and I'll let you have last word. It's not the best closing line this issue, but but but this is my stick and I'm sticking with it. I'm not here to do any more damage Inducks. I'm here to help you catch the wasp.

636
01:11:19,612 --> 01:11:30,771
Excellent. Thank you for that, and thank you to Warren and Dan both for joining me. Thanks for having me. I'll look forward to the next time. Thank you, and Dan great to meet you. Thank you again, Mark.
