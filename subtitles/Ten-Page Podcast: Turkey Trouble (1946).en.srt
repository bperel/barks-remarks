Alright. Listeners, thank you so much for joining us. We have another

4
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:41,922
episode of the ten page podcast

5
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:46,855
and I'm delighted to have a fellow Ducktales fan

6
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:50,934
joining me. I've I've been having a lot of fun meeting people and

7
00:00:51,449 --> 00:01:01,934
and geek out with with fellow duck fans in the course of doing this podcast. So I'm gonna ask him to please introduce himself and if you can tell us a little bit about your background

8
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:06,210
in Duck Comics. Yeah. Hi. Thank you for having

9
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:08,847
And care. I'm from Sweden

10
00:01:09,306 --> 00:01:10,365
scandinavia. In your.

11
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:11,579
Reading

12
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:17,916
that comics since the the mid eight is. I was like six zero seven, I think. And

13
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:18,832
mostly

14
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:21,757
plus through the weekly donald that

15
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:22,954
that's

16
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,067
still coming out the.

17
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:28,270
And the from the the beginning I got to

18
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:38,364
understand that some of of the creators are more significant than others. And, of course, i'd got to learn about Barks.

19
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:46,517
From the store I think. So... And I'm really happy to be here with you. I hope the listeners can handle my Swedish accent.

20
00:01:47,228 --> 00:01:52,671
Absolutely. Pierre, I'm I'm delighted to have you on, and I'm sure that the listeners can can handle

21
00:01:53,248 --> 00:02:07,958
your Swedish accent because, you know, I feel like Donald Duck belongs to Scandinavia as much as it belongs to the United States. Right? So I really am happy to get your perspective on some of these stories,

22
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:09,177
especially

23
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,331
a very american

24
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:12,204
story.

25
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:16,898
Like the one we're gonna talk about today, which is was Turkey trouble.

26
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:21,463
And deals with the extremely American holiday of Thanksgiving.

27
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:35,705
I'm excited to release some of these out of order for the ten pager. So I can tie this to our American holiday here. And i, you know, I'm looking forward to getting your perspective and hearing some of the ways that they dealt with publishing these stories.

28
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:39,291
In Scandinavia because they're are so beloved

29
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,960
around the world. The the stories are so popular

30
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:43,996
in.

31
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:45,251
Right?

32
00:02:45,944 --> 00:02:47,679
And I am fascinated

33
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:49,393
by that facts,

34
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,864
because the stories are so

35
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,657
incredibly american

36
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,029
Very capitalist

37
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,389
too. And and for them to be popular

38
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:04,364
in, like, the the social democracy sees.

39
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:05,444
Mh.

40
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:18,619
That fa me Pierre did... You... So you said you figured out that Carl marx was great pretty early on. I started reading them and learned about Barks around that same time in, like, the mid to late eighties.

41
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,900
I'm wondering

42
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:26,728
was was it kind of a community thing where you knew other people who enjoyed that Donald duck magazine

43
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,977
Well, the down the weekly

44
00:03:30,555 --> 00:03:32,693
was since list. I think the biggest

45
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:34,990
comic gets sweden.

46
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:38,061
Everybody know you and notes

47
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:58,025
about the these new economics. So it was a it was like I didn't stand out because I read the the electronics. Yeah. Today I kinda stand out more of upwards That's still there is quite a big Swedish community that that's read these economics in the box in particular.

48
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,338
Even among

49
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:04,128
dance today is we. So I never felt, like, totally alone.

50
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:08,775
Right. So they didn't... They didn't hold on to these this childhood

51
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:10,995
pursuit. Right? Yeah. Exactly.

52
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:14,815
Yeah. I mean, I I grew up and I knew absolutely

53
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:23,785
no one who liked these. My brothers would read him occasionally because I had him lying around. But but I always did feel a little bit embarrassed as I got into my teeth

54
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:25,861
being such a big fan.

55
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:33,246
But thank you for joining me and and giving your perspective on this one. You know, I've given my myself permission with these

56
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:35,415
ten page podcast

57
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,333
stories

58
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:38,527
to be a little bit less prepared.

59
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:59,270
So they're a little bit less where we're gonna we're gonna be a little bit kind of free flow. So I am gonna talk about this story sequentially. And I'm just gonna kinda shoot it over to you if there's something where I'd like you to talk about it. That's great. A little bit of a little bit of background info in the United States, this one was published first in walt Disney's

60
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,805
comics and storage number seventy five. And

61
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:05,125
I see an alternate title Turkey

62
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:05,965
turmoil.

63
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:16,479
Right? And and I think some other story might have been called turkey trouble at some point. So I should distinguish this is one that was first published back in nineteen forty six.

64
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:23,354
Here in the Us. So I think this is a fun one. It's it's not like one of his all time

65
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:32,541
best ten... Ten page ones, but but I really like this one. Pierre, you are telling me a little bit though before we started

66
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:46,323
about how they kinda reframe this one in Sweden. Do you mind telling the listeners a little bit about that? Yeah. Well, it's just the Us. Thanksgiving is really holiday sweden. They changed it to Easter,

67
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:51,992
which is swedish holiday as well as Well, it that's work being

68
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:54,189
changed from thanksgiving

69
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:55,867
to Easter,

70
00:05:56,206 --> 00:06:06,759
and I think I wouldn't have thought about being strange if I hadn't read, like, the English or know as well. But it makes sense. It's a

71
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:10,785
change that makes the story much more accessible for

72
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:23,955
to issue distribute readers, I think. Yeah. That's really interesting to me. And and as I think back on this one, it's right because there's there's not too much thanksgiving about it. Right? It's it's all about the big holiday

73
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,475
meal bases

74
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:29,635
being prepared for it. Some of perhaps other holiday stories

75
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:35,957
we're probably harder for them to change, because they're more explicit about, like, Thanksgiving

76
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:38,490
and and maybe dressing up like,

77
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:46,421
or things that. I think that some of... The... I can't remember we try, but so some all the other late

78
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:57,655
thanksgiving stories. The editors actually had the turkish really drove onto to the pigs and they moved the story to a Christmas side. I should never looked Al that up beforehand, but i.

79
00:06:58,272 --> 00:07:02,618
So since most of these stories did and up meetings,

80
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:08,680
at least in in they eighth they had to, like put some that's gotten ibm idea

81
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:19,309
touch to two of them to make sense. It's always a trick to localize something like this. And so you've read this in both Swedish and English. I. Excellent. Well,

82
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:27,854
let's get into the story, and you can tell me you know, anything that you think is notable in in you know how you originally

83
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:34,102
read it. Great. So Turkey trouble, here opens with the Nephews

84
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:43,348
in a state of gloom. And I really like the little splash panel. You know, they both got... They've all got these like, clouds of gloom literal

85
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:44,986
over their heads

86
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:51,793
about the fact that Donald says that he can't afford to buy it turkey for thanksgiving

87
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:52,672
dinner.

88
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:57,985
And, you know, I wanna just talk right away about those little gloom clouds. I saw different

89
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,840
it's fun how they've been translated into different languages

90
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,340
because they had it up on index.

91
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,572
So they're they're just walking through the city.

92
00:08:07,991 --> 00:08:14,105
Feeling gloomy about how they're gonna have to resort to eating wee, hot dogs,

93
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,400
if he can even find some and speculating. They might end up just having to eat potato pan cakes.

94
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,460
And

95
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,191
there's a fun little side gag where one of the f fuse says that he wishes Turkeys

96
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:35,041
were so thick around here. You had to kick them out of bit you're way. And he keeps a little piece of paper. And it ends up being a raffle ticket,

97
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:36,776
very convenient.

98
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,011
I mean

99
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:40,402
for a Turkey

100
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:46,434
of course that where a drawing is going be held to to find out if you're the winner

101
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:57,852
at twelve ten o'clock which is almost the time right now. And so they're gonna head to that raffle. Any thoughts on this opening setup here? Well, as you said, say it's

102
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:01,085
a very convenient opening. And I think Barks

103
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:04,185
does work with those like, convenience.

104
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,985
Yes. Things happen

105
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:12,195
because the store needed and I have have the feeling that for some people, it's kinda

106
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:27,916
bothering them. But for me, it's just effective story story telling it's like, the build up is quickly done. You can get do the fan checks and well, try the actual story that this is as well. As we will see.

107
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:46,890
Yeah. I I totally agree. I I had that feeling sometimes and and as I've been revisiting these more, I'm like, I really admire sometimes he really just gets into it. So on the next page, you know, they're racing over. It's a very fun panel of them with our feet Al blur.

108
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:55,425
They're looking at the the number on their ticket, which is two three six zero three seven. And we kinda pan over

109
00:09:55,805 --> 00:10:05,555
to the hall where the Raffle is being held and and sure enough. It's their number that being drawn at that moment. There's a blind folded man who must Gladstone it. And

110
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:07,273
the person who

111
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:09,790
drew it is in the process

112
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:13,518
of telling the audience that someone needs to come forward

113
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:18,027
by the count three before they're gonna draw another number and

114
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:26,936
and and the nephews user over here in this. And so you you wanna tell us how this page goes? Yeah. Well, very comes me

115
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:27,973
counting.

116
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:33,610
Pass through the word the word three they arrive. And subsequently,

117
00:10:33,987 --> 00:11:00,064
they are led to another room and they start wondering what right do they have this prepared this either way, but they are soon to realize that it's not the to dish. It's a living turkey and quite grumpy looking Turkey as well. Yeah. I I really like the setup there. Right? The audience kinda gets the Al little for about that there's something wrong with this turkey that they've just won because

118
00:11:00,922 --> 00:11:10,875
why would it be in the back room? You mentioned that the Turkey on onto the next page, they meet the Turkey and, you know, they they're shocked to see that it's alive

119
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:11,729
and

120
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:17,283
pierre, I love how Barks has drawn this grumpy looking turkey

121
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:25,528
I don't know about you. Yeah. It's while is Scrooge, like say Al artist, it's giving the characters

122
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:30,037
specific expressions and, like Summer, their qualities Al

123
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:34,053
character and this poor turkey, which

124
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:35,132
he

125
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,410
isn't really

126
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:42,413
ready to be a winner, and he's he he he's not ready to go and where. Also

127
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,806
big heavy it turkey and the kids

128
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,459
don't get far. Right. It start

129
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,419
carrying it way but they soon give

130
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:57,915
exhausted. Yeah. I love... I love how they try to, you know, forty it all bound up at first.

131
00:11:58,814 --> 00:12:20,425
They have to rest all weary. And we see the Turkey also very weary while their rest, thing and, you know, they they get their wagon Al first thinking that they're gonna tow it in the wag and and and then at some point they figure out that they can pitch to the wagon. And, you know, what what is it that they come to realize by the time they get home beer? Well, they kinda

132
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:21,125
good.

133
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,280
Attached to the

134
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,040
Turkey. They

135
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,280
name him then lady him raffle

136
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:35,124
I I think in the English original, isn't it too? They they para it. Right? Raffle,

137
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:59,258
which is just the good affect adaptation in English. And they get to think that they haven't got a dealer box or rather nice pet. Yeah. They they pretty quickly start to think for them as a pat. And while they are bonding. As they've kind of made that transition to thinking of it as a pet, Donald is getting home. He's having in kind of gloomy thoughts,

138
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:01,456
not having a great option

139
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:02,575
for a thanksgiving.

140
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:08,543
And, you know, he over hears the nephews talking about their Turkey

141
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:18,504
and looks Al the window. And what's Pierre, tell us about his immediate response to wrap up page. Yeah. Well, he sammy

142
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,700
responsible adult do. He grabs the hatch and runs out to kill it.

143
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:30,363
Yeah. I like that. Not Without a second thought, he's just got an accent ready.

144
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:37,717
Yeah. I like the line he gets off here white meat dark meat. Drumstick sticks on the roof. Here I come. That's

145
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,906
caught a of frame.

146
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:41,840
Yeah.

147
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:44,315
And so, you know, the nephews

148
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:57,790
immediately tackle him because they have already... They've have resolved it in their mind. He's no longer dinner. He is a pet. So I guess at this point, this you're right. This wouldn't have been too hard to rework into Swedish.

149
00:13:58,243 --> 00:14:05,095
And to make it talk about eastern dinner, because they must just sp that they don't have anything for their easter dinner. Exactly.

150
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:29,464
So, you know, this kinda of sets up a little bit of attention. Donald like, you know, you've got a Turkey and we've got thanksgiving coming up. We've got this big holiday and what are we gonna do? Mana nephews you bring up a new suggestion kind of out of nowhere. Again, it's a little convenient, but we're going on to the next stage, the next sequence of the story where they they've heard about a turkey shoot and

151
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:34,652
Donald is excited. He's full of blu about being a great shot.

152
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:46,855
And so he goes to grab his like, his rifle and he heads to this turkey shoot. Is this a term that that you knew? Well, I even think, it turkish if you

153
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:55,355
express. Right. So there there is like a term Turkey shoe. Right? I think that really were like an old time competition.

154
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:05,552
I think this was a thing and it... It's not anymore. So a turkey shoot is an opportunity for someone to take advantage of an easy situation.

155
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:08,428
And I guess it's named for when Wild Turkeys

156
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:11,165
would be scattered by a hunter.

157
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:26,415
This does talk specifically about, like, this sort of hunting event, where you would shoot at these cards. So this is a very specific american. I don't think they're really aren't anymore though. And I like this little club, the south side Joe's.

158
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:28,769
This kind of club

159
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:33,220
you know, a fellowship club a thing in Sweden. Well, I I guess,

160
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:34,958
pretty much

161
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:35,895
relatable.

162
00:15:36,374 --> 00:15:38,605
So that that works quite well. I think

163
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:51,105
Yeah. And it works in English too, but it definitely has a pretty dated v. Right. These are like these these kinds of clubs are kind of kinda going by the wayside in in united I think I think about like, the

164
00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:53,257
order of moose and the alex

165
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:59,993
I really like this setup. You wanna tell us about the the turkey shoot setup up here?

166
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,810
Yeah. Well,

167
00:16:02,148 --> 00:16:17,434
the good have the good news helping up five targets for Donald to try to shoot down and he needs to permanently needs to hit three four of targets. And if it does, the turkey is supposedly case.

168
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:20,789
Right. And the nephews user chatting with the

169
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:24,909
the Joe who doesn't seem very worried about the prospect

170
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:28,329
of Donald hitting the targets all the way across the river.

171
00:16:28,984 --> 00:16:29,484
And

172
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:34,064
and and we come to learn that this is their only turkey.

173
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:38,737
They're running a racket here. Right? Because it's a bait bird.

174
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:47,374
They plan to eat it for their own thanksgiving dinner. They're just gonna use it to make to make some money off suckers because no one ever

175
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:52,363
wins. And so they never need more than their one like showcase turkey.

176
00:16:52,861 --> 00:17:01,489
And Pierre, you wanna tell us why no one ever wins Well, it's staged. Not only are the targets far off. They are also

177
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:07,064
impossible to put down with the rifle. They are a bunch of sheet.

178
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:09,201
Yeah. Because one of them is, like,

179
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,598
bracket into place.

180
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:14,855
And and we learn this because, you know, the Nephews

181
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:16,229
resolve

182
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,069
that

183
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:22,509
to to help Donald win this one. One of them needs to... They need to swim behind

184
00:17:23,103 --> 00:17:25,277
And they're using their p shooter

185
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:45,966
This is a fun little data at element that. Right? Because in the nineteen fifties, forties and fifties, p shooters would have been and little American play things. This is that something that's kind of a cliche in Sweden pier? Yeah. Well, as as you say, like, in the first half of the twenty century. That was one of the fun stuff kids.

186
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:51,169
And and it's one of the fires that this is from a long time ago. But Yeah.

187
00:17:51,747 --> 00:18:01,374
So they're using their p shooters to knock these targets down. But when they come to the final target, they realized that One of them is gonna have to go to some real risk

188
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:12,096
to make it look like he's shooting that last target. They're gonna... He's gonna have to go back behind and and knock it down at just the right time. What do you think Pierre?

189
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:13,213
It's

190
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:19,724
it's what they are. It's not something you are advised to to do at home. I think yeah.

191
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:24,996
I like the little side gag at the end there. Right, where he gets his his tail feathers,

192
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:27,347
whichever nephew you get Ducktales feathers

193
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:31,012
clipped off. Why don't you tell us Pierre, we transition

194
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:38,624
to the Turkey being delivered. You know, Donald has won the turkey the south side Joe's have lost their turkey

195
00:18:38,978 --> 00:18:39,478
and

196
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:43,269
tell us about the turkey delivery. Yeah. Well donald.

197
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:46,280
Quite edge changes just to kinda get this dinner.

198
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:51,408
The turkey is not us and just to become dinner.

199
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:52,467
So

200
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,716
donald it up to him with his

201
00:18:56,212 --> 00:18:59,501
ex, but the turkey gets the first

202
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:04,624
strike and they begin tight and it's quite violent fact

203
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,664
up with them both be

204
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:09,199
more or less

205
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:10,478
just

206
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:17,631
by by this moment, the nat get added to finish off, the turkey

207
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,244
down having found, I guess,

208
00:19:20,864 --> 00:19:22,604
a brother in Barks or

209
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:32,343
friend at least he refuses to have the third gig kid off So no. No. They have two pets turkish. Yeah. Exactly.

210
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:37,924
So so Pierre, I love this page. This is my favorite a page of this ten pager

211
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:41,204
I love the way the Turkey bus sat of his cage

212
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:43,044
already fighting

213
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:46,049
I love the the fight panels

214
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:50,272
that Donald. I love his fighting posture opposite the Turkey

215
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:56,158
I just... I love that the concept of this basically a knock down drag out

216
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:58,455
fist fight with the turkey.

217
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:03,559
It's such a funny imagery, and it's the reason that I wanted to do this

218
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:06,752
specific story for our American Thanksgiving

219
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:17,623
episode. Like, this one makes me laugh out loud. I I just... I love this page so much. And when we get to the page, the panel, and you mentioned where the nephews are ready to

220
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:19,278
finish him off with the Al,

221
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:29,204
and and he says, what? Bump off this turkey. I love this turkey. He's got spirit. And he just toss the axe over the fence.

222
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:32,831
Not not a very smart maneuver there. But

223
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:38,872
but a great image. I I love it so much. And it's Al nice because,

224
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:41,608
Donald gets to find a friend.

225
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:44,565
Yeah. That's not too commonly in the stories.

226
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:47,830
Usually ends up is either

227
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:51,338
getting angry himself with others or authors

228
00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:53,270
get to know it by again.

229
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:58,378
It's right. It's a it's a kindred spirit. Right? As he sees it, because it's says

230
00:20:59,556 --> 00:21:00,755
and short temp.

231
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:02,227
As he is.

232
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:16,409
And and I love the the last page here that we're getting to early we close out the story from the perspective of some random neighbor, who is puzzling over the Ducktales behavior. Right? Because they've got

233
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,169
two Turkeys

234
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:19,769
in their backyard,

235
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:22,729
and he can smell them cooking

236
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:23,769
cabbage.

237
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:24,744
And

238
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,723
and we see Donald cooking what he seems to be regarding is a really lovely

239
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:34,004
vegetarian meal and getting ready to enjoy it. And

240
00:21:34,382 --> 00:21:42,024
as he transitions to go tell the kids that dinner is ready, what what do we see from outside the window here?

241
00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:45,524
Yeah. Well, i'm outside, do we know the turkey's

242
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:48,735
are getting ready to have there. Thanks

243
00:21:49,153 --> 00:21:51,050
they dinner I guess. And

244
00:21:51,588 --> 00:21:52,607
Al the docs

245
00:21:53,065 --> 00:22:01,602
believe their kitchen, the turkey is supposedly to sneaks aside when the doctor turn. It's all being finished. The plates are empty,

246
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:07,249
and the the kitchen are filled out the turkey tracks all over.

247
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:10,450
Right. And and we get this great panel

248
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:12,144
having just

249
00:22:12,843 --> 00:22:18,091
completely devoured their thanksgiving. We have the two Turkeys are completely fat and stuffed,

250
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:19,745
very content looking.

251
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:31,991
And Donald has this great word balloon where he sums up. The whole story. He says so that's the story. We we got these turks he calls them. For thanksgiving dinner, and instead they ours.

252
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:36,166
And how do we close it out pierre? Yeah. Wow.

253
00:22:36,805 --> 00:22:38,239
The next Obviously,

254
00:22:38,895 --> 00:22:41,509
we given up and they put the sign

255
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:42,905
outside of the house

256
00:22:43,243 --> 00:22:46,514
for sale to turkey's bonus done for hamburgers.

257
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:48,754
We'll be back in five minutes.

258
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:49,854
Right.

259
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:50,834
So

260
00:22:51,174 --> 00:22:51,674
so

261
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:54,707
it's a very tight story. You know,

262
00:22:55,586 --> 00:23:03,334
these ten pager, I don't cover them as much on the podcast, but they're really wonderful. And this one is like, I don't think it's

263
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:13,537
remembered by fans as being, like one of his legendary ones, but it's just a great example of a really solid one that tells this very

264
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:14,455
punchy,

265
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:15,652
quick

266
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,164
very funny story with, like a absolutely

267
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:40,322
perfect ending. I really love this one. What did you think about it Pierre as just like a regular old Barks story? And then is someone, you know, leaving this from from Sweden. Yeah. It's... The store the pacing of the story is pretty much perfect. You never it never shows style. It's one detail after another and

268
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:41,321
happens

269
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,876
right in the exact movement that they are supposed to have the story

270
00:23:46,255 --> 00:23:46,955
and it's

271
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:49,949
lots of good dialogue. As you have mentioned,

272
00:23:50,309 --> 00:24:00,018
and the fighting scenes and I mean, in one second, he has to exit is said, then it puts out is right. So, I mean, there's lots of bad

273
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:05,425
for kids got. I was it's about now. I was thinking that this one is kind of violent.

274
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:13,316
Did that... Is that weird or does that how that go over? Yeah. I think it's... I mean, if you compare it to to the donna

275
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:14,770
animated shorts.

276
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:22,346
It's it's a same spirit. And it's just. I mean, it's it's Al always in a fun

277
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:23,878
good manner

278
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:38,935
happy mode. The kids and done are pretty much always on the same side, It's some of these stories have them put against each other, but they're there working together to get the good if Family dinner.

279
00:24:39,548 --> 00:24:40,048
But...

280
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:45,516
Yeah. It's a a story with ending and the lots of violence.

281
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:47,770
That's great.

282
00:24:48,784 --> 00:24:54,737
I I think this story is just a total delight. And I think it's a great example of like a a Barks

283
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:56,495
holiday story.

284
00:24:57,149 --> 00:24:59,886
You know, I like to talk about, like, favorite panels

285
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:12,206
in these. Are there any of them that really stood out to you that you really liked Well, there are quite a few... I mean, this story is from nineteen forty six. Right? Yeah. Okay. And those gear,

286
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:17,191
I love but, like, he's just started to find this

287
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:20,464
game in search. He it's quite

288
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:23,470
that is getting to really enjoy

289
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:26,579
drawing these stories. But on page...

290
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:27,513
Let's see.

291
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:31,357
On page seven, the first panel you got Al

292
00:25:32,516 --> 00:25:33,535
link directly

293
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:34,533
to us

294
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:49,656
towards us as a reader. And I'm not sure that would be allowed to today it even put the gun directly to the viewer, but it's really nice, like, compose Yeah also like the five scene as you mentioned

295
00:25:50,072 --> 00:25:51,050
will be between

296
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:59,975
downtown and the second third. And the factor is the second last panel of part was a really fun to look at.

297
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:06,249
Those are all those are all good choices. You know, you're right. That's really striking how he's aiming the rifle

298
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:13,950
right at the reader. This is a kind of a random panel to highlight. But I love the panel that just shows on that same page where he's shooting.

299
00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:19,530
It's got the south side Joe. Very casually clipping his nails

300
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:22,558
to show how un concerned he is

301
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:24,271
about

302
00:26:24,703 --> 00:26:34,096
losing their freshest turkey. And, yeah, we we already highlighted some of them. But but almost every panel with Mcdonald's Turkey

303
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:42,359
just just cracks me up. It's so funny the way it's like grit. It's teeth. It's Turkey. It's non existent Turkey teeth.

304
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:48,183
Standing off with Donald and how they kind of form that bond over violence

305
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,549
And and the Nephews Turkey as well

306
00:26:51,888 --> 00:26:56,454
he he does such a great job of making these very relatable

307
00:26:56,831 --> 00:26:57,331
expressions

308
00:26:58,306 --> 00:27:00,122
on these drawings of animals.

309
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:02,692
They they really

310
00:27:03,032 --> 00:27:10,085
land and they're very memorable in a very short number of frames i think. It choice

311
00:27:11,157 --> 00:27:20,763
it's striking and to be able to... Because the turkeys are also supplied. They do look like turkey that we see. And still they are able to

312
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,875
express both anger and

313
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,159
it's pretty good work. Barks.

314
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:32,239
Yeah. And I'm not sure if you have noticed but Barks actually

315
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:42,147
signed this order with this name. And where where is that? And this one? It's quite hidden. It's on page four. The second panel. On Al of the cams,

316
00:27:43,665 --> 00:27:57,407
Kitchen, It says box studs. So... That's right but Yeah. That's a fun little piece of trivia. This was, I guess, one of the... I remember reading that and it's one of the very good catch. Thank you. One of the very few panels

317
00:27:58,146 --> 00:28:01,739
stories where he sneaks in a reference because of course, he famously

318
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,819
was not allowed to put his actual signature.

319
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:11,901
These are all walt Disney's Donald dot. For the longest time. Exactly. Yeah. So

320
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:29,974
thank you so much Pierre for for talking about this story with me. What is there is there anything that really stands out to you as someone reading this from Sweden that, you know, maybe the translators couldn't account for that just... You're like, oh, this is this is an American element.

321
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:42,761
Well, we ordered they talked about the hot holidays, of course. But then in the very beginning, of the kids talk about what they will have to be because they don't have turkey. And they say,

322
00:28:43,374 --> 00:28:45,950
venus or even rotate the pancakes.

323
00:28:46,447 --> 00:28:51,338
And the translators also shades that to, like, Swedish

324
00:28:52,156 --> 00:28:53,429
counterparts. That's

325
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:59,382
and for some reason, I'm not sure why. But in the very very end when they have gone to

326
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:00,660
get hamburgers,

327
00:29:01,214 --> 00:29:02,552
the Swedish translation

328
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:05,206
says they have gone to have hot dogs.

329
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:06,704
We

330
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:28,645
I looked up. The this story came out in nineteen and seven in sweden, it it just got quite late. And I'm pretty sure that was hamburgers since we abide by the. I'm not sure why they changed it, but maybe it was still bit to exotic sure. That's interesting that this one didn't make it over there until the late seventies

331
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:32,299
I think I think that's because the...

332
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:33,739
I I mentioned

333
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:34,619
the

334
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:35,439
Al,

335
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,259
the main

336
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:47,976
the this comic with... It started to come out in nineteen forty eight. So lots of the stories from before that's. They make it into the

337
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:54,601
much. So were they publishing everything and pretty much that that one single publication

338
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:57,214
whereas, okay. So in America,

339
00:29:57,634 --> 00:29:59,134
you know, they were doing the

340
00:29:59,474 --> 00:30:08,949
both the four color one shot un walt Disney's comics and stories and then the added donald dock and uncle screwed. The the four colors

341
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:10,029
magazines

342
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:10,909
and

343
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:11,909
subsequently

344
00:30:12,664 --> 00:30:16,004
some dollar kind of speech. They were either

345
00:30:16,344 --> 00:30:17,524
published into

346
00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:18,944
several parts,

347
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:21,344
like they cut up the stories.

348
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:31,312
So each Magazine had seven pages and then it was to big Convenient next to me. And in the fifties, they started to publish

349
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:32,524
four color

350
00:30:33,904 --> 00:30:36,564
in Sweden, which allowed, like, donna

351
00:30:37,984 --> 00:30:38,884
adventure stories

352
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:43,557
was allowed to be like this essay it should be. Nice.

353
00:30:44,196 --> 00:30:47,933
Yeah. That's really interesting. I really appreciate getting your perspective

354
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:49,931
as, you know, a scandinavian

355
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:54,812
fan because I know that these are so important to all of the countries

356
00:30:55,268 --> 00:30:56,305
of Scandinavia.

357
00:30:56,783 --> 00:31:11,018
This one, if if you look at it on index, this is pretty well regarded. You know, the this one has a seven point four out of ten, which is good for rank four hundred and forty nine. Out of the forty one thousand some comics.

358
00:31:11,554 --> 00:31:12,054
So

359
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:19,329
that that compares pretty favorably to a lot of the ten pager. It's obviously not like regarded one of is classics,

360
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:24,609
but it's definitely in that range that would suggest it's your your solid average

361
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:26,070
early Barks.

362
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:32,410
Ten pager. But I I do find this one is one of the more memorable of the thanksgiving

363
00:31:32,988 --> 00:31:33,786
themed ones.

364
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:35,457
Or me.

365
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:46,202
So... Yeah. Lot of fun. Any any other thoughts, anything else you wanted to mention Peter? No. I think we know that through this story quite nice. It's

366
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,320
as to say, it's

367
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:59,409
not not really really classic. And well when you read it, you really got to appreciate, like, the good day work of of got Barks. I I mean, he he put out one of these ten

368
00:31:59,949 --> 00:32:02,002
Scrooge well. Twenty years.

369
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,450
Well one story a month. And he kept, like, this quality about the storytelling

370
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:08,966
and in

371
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:14,614
the drawings and it's quite amazing when you think about about

372
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,612
the story this is

373
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:19,184
just plain fan Absolutely.

374
00:32:19,683 --> 00:32:23,260
You said it very well. Right? This is a big part of why we

375
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:30,144
are such big fans of carl Barks. Right? Because this is just kinda one of his average stories

376
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,097
and and it's delightful

377
00:32:32,434 --> 00:32:39,328
and he kept up this pace for so many years as you said. So Thank you again so much for joining.

378
00:32:40,103 --> 00:32:45,069
Looking forward to, you know, some others that'll benefit from your perspective. And
