First, I've got returning guest t Ko.

20
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:38,313
That, do you wanna introduce yourself and and mention some of what you... Your involvement with the? Yeah. I've

21
00:01:38,652 --> 00:01:44,285
pretty much been an associate of the Disney Comics since high Scrooge, really, oh my gosh.

22
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:52,154
You know, I I I talked with my fiance all the time. It's, like, oh my gosh. Two thousand six was like, almost twenty years ago now. Yeah.

23
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,105
I I started out local utilizing

24
00:01:56,085 --> 00:02:03,040
and translating a lot of the monthly and, you know, all the international imports And I also did

25
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,780
commentary contributions as I said before,

26
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,647
for the Fan graphics Carl Barks books but I'm also in most of the wonderful...

27
00:02:12,105 --> 00:02:15,318
The that floyd God that that Fan graphics did

28
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:19,000
that kind of was science fiction. I

29
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:19,956
never

30
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:21,072
expected

31
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:36,431
them to reprint every single one of those floyd god and daily Mouse. Ever. Ever and that is that is David Ge doing who whom we're going to be mentioning quite a few times in this podcast. Oh, yes. I'm definitely

32
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:39,160
definitely crib from some of the research.

33
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:45,975
He did. Yeah. This this episode might as well be called Gottfredson and remarks. Yeah.

34
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:51,050
But that there's just not as much of an audience. I'm afraid for that.

35
00:02:51,390 --> 00:03:03,985
So so thanks for coming back that. And then Debbie, you are a new guest and and I'm so happy to have you join us. Debbie Perry who has some really great insight on

36
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:05,085
both the Barks

37
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,780
and Gottfredson

38
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:38,457
pages. And and then you're you're a Disney fan artist and you've got your own web comment. Debbie, how long have you been in to the Disney comics. Oh, gosh. That goes way that. To somewhere in the Barks when Al seventies or something when they had this three pack that you'd buy from the Wit books. My mom would bring those home for us. We have used used to have stacks of, like, mickey mouse, donald duck, bugs bunny, all those wit books and occasionally actually be something good in there.

39
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,250
Yeah. That's where I saw the first saw

40
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,570
parent

41
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,450
and

42
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:56,105
ancient persia. Holy yeah yeah. Those those two are probably the first ones I remember from Bart. We would... I'd read those every summer because they'd be at our summer cottage.

43
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:14,139
I do enjoy hearing from people about, like, their first Barks. Because... Because that's the thing most people who get into Barks, they can pretty vividly or actually a couple of tony struggle things. I didn't find out till later. One of them was the weighted create mystery and another was something...

44
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:21,874
Adventure on Bom bird island or both books that were all in the batches that those are all stories that for better

45
00:04:22,251 --> 00:04:30,725
got launched in my head. Sure. I I can picture that Long island one if clogged up the back issue bins and my local

46
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:36,690
at my local store. And then you you put out a web comment. Right? Oh, yeah. It's

47
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,820
fluffy and Mer. They're a cat and mouse.

48
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:50,845
Originally, they kind of... I thought of the cat and I was thinking of tom and Jerry, but then I thought instead of having the mean cat in the the supposedly

49
00:04:51,302 --> 00:04:53,974
nice mouse. He's not very nice at all. Jerry.

50
00:04:54,932 --> 00:04:58,840
About to have why not have this really nasty sort of mouse.

51
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:09,459
And is really friendly cat, and that just sort went from there that over the years, I think the characters have mellow some in mer gone from being a nasty character

52
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,179
to just being sort of the grumpy character.

53
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:23,514
Yeah. It it's really cute. I I really enjoyed it. You've got a really nice style that Yeah. Extends to the fan art that you do. Oh, yeah. That I kinda taught myself how to draw those

54
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:46,993
Nikki and Donald and all that. Looking at the old Gladstone, but mh. I mean the whitman books were wet I first seen the Gladstone books were what really got me into it because they had have the articles about the creators of who did them. That's where I found the names of Barks and Got said and fact, but I think the first god I remember reading was the seven ghost.

55
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,554
Oh, yeah. It was that was and they did. That was a beautiful

56
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:57,779
introduction that that was... I think, you know, I might be biased because I worked on the I w books, but I always

57
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:05,492
say that the Gladstone, that first period in the eighties that was the best period of Disney comics

58
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:06,371
in

59
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:12,824
history because It it is. It it is established Barks, by name and print, and it also

60
00:06:13,484 --> 00:06:14,664
reintroduced God for.

61
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:19,908
Right us God had not been run at all for Al least since

62
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:36,192
forty nine. At that point, nineteen forty nine, I think that was the last time they ran the strips. I don't know in the comic books anyway, they stopped running the serial, all of a sudden in Walt disney comments and stories when they favor the re ons or the the new Paul Murray

63
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:43,953
stories and serial. But, yeah. And Glad, of course, introduced Al these new artists like Building van horn, Don Rowe

64
00:06:44,412 --> 00:06:44,912
brought

65
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:49,866
yep to these shores. Oh we yeah those those Donnie Covers like.

66
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:51,959
Yeah. Those...

67
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,279
You know, and it's funny too because

68
00:06:54,619 --> 00:07:04,476
I've heard... I'm not gonna say their names, but, like, they'll ask, like, the editors, like, I draw like jp? See heard this covers like, no. No. No. No. No. No Is it oh why not?

69
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:13,631
Yeah. Those those covers were so wonderful. Oh, yeah. Those were some of the... They just jumped off the new stands. The see covers.

70
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,470
Have.

71
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:20,764
It. Yeah. I I totally agree. You're you're right too that because it's like that period with Gladstone,

72
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:23,257
it was the first time that, like vans.

73
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:31,482
Were we're running the show. Yeah. Right and they got to... They got to give these creators their due. I remember reading recently

74
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:41,165
two that they it was in a hindsight. They realized the Mickey Mouse line and didn't really perform that well and that they couldn't have justify

75
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,760
running it if they had known ahead of time,

76
00:07:44,400 --> 00:08:00,095
how poorly it would have sold. So I'm just I'm so grateful for that I got to read all of those wonderful god and stories. You know, I think that's why they kinda switched over eventually to the Nikki and Don Donald and Nikki. Well, Mickey ran the whole

77
00:08:00,553 --> 00:08:11,836
run, that whole first glad run right to the very end. They never brought Mickey back. They never brought a Mickey title back when bruce Hamilton got the license again. They had

78
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:16,960
Donald and Nicky by pushing brian the instead of mickey yeah exactly.

79
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,695
Yeah. That was... I think that was the way that they justify it. And so

80
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:26,449
of course, they were... They would have been very interested and they did

81
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:31,820
run the story that we're gonna be talking about. You guys... I I so fascinated

82
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:43,615
by this story. The the riddle of the red hat, it it really to me feels like this big... Wet, you know? Like, why why didn't Barks

83
00:08:43,615 --> 00:08:55,993
do more of these Mickey mouse stories why? Why did he himself barely remember having done it? And and what would it have been like if he had done more of these? He

84
00:08:56,689 --> 00:09:01,093
himself was the first to basically talk about God for

85
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:02,306
long shadow?

86
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:26,947
A guess for the for the handful of people who maybe don't know who we're talking about. Somehow, but tell us a little bit about about Floyd God and and why he's so important. Well, so Da, he was to mickey mouse what Carl Barks was the Donald Duck. He did not create or originate the character, but he is probably

87
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:33,915
the most influential artist associated with him. And what's... What I was fine fascinating

88
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:34,875
is

89
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:35,755
that

90
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:40,678
both of these guys had a bit of a stent at in Disney cartoons.

91
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:48,787
Both concurrently, and when they started doing the comics, you know, Floyd was there in the very very early days.

92
00:09:49,324 --> 00:10:10,309
Yeah. I gave Christian like, for not knowing but... Well, least not they kill but just gonna be disappointed if they didn't know exactly which days, but it was very, very early days. He he was I know he's quoted in a few things about he remembers when a I works left wall. Yeah So he was there that early. But he took over the strip.

93
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:12,227
Walt Disney and

94
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:23,982
Bob had been doing it themselves and a few other artists sat, and then Floyd took it over and he filled that job for some with except with a couple of exceptions.

95
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:29,863
He did... He drew every trip for some forty five, forty six years.

96
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:30,701
And...

97
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:31,438
Yeah.

98
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:34,373
It's it's... It was quite a legacy,

99
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:36,502
and he also

100
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:52,385
did a lot of the writing up until about forty two or so. And what I always find interesting is that Got was probably the biggest influence on Carl Barks. As far as as far as Disney car tuning is concerned,

101
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:53,315
Bark

102
00:10:54,015 --> 00:11:06,950
Barks kinda lived in a bubble, and that's kind of why this is is the only mickey mouse story. We'll get into that a little later. But Right. He was very much influenced by how floyd Drew,

103
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,210
floyd wrote and pay stories

104
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:20,628
and I'm sure you've got some stuff cold from David's wonderful article that we're going to quote quite a extensive leg because That is the of piece on this odd

105
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:45,610
odd ball story. Yeah. Why don't I throw a quote in really quick, and I'll let you keep going. Bark said. And I don't remember if this is from David's article from one of the other sources. But Mh he said, well, we'll look at my ducks and all those other characters. I've been trying to imitate Floyd work. It's plain to me, and I hope it's playing to other people. You know Mh. He made no secret about it. Floyd was a huge

106
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:46,685
inspiration. Mh.

107
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:49,545
Yes. And this story in particular,

108
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:51,425
there are poses

109
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:53,505
lifted directly from

110
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:54,545
Ga

111
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:56,136
strip. I mean, Al

112
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:57,474
specifically,

113
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,422
the nineteen forty one story love trouble, which...

114
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:15,256
And my opinion my theory is that helped the find the new look of Mickey Mouse, more than any other single thing. Any other cartoon film because that was not an adventure story at all. It's a very domestic.

115
00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:24,092
It's almost... It's almost like a dis... It's almost like a Disney version of the film of Philadelphia story. And it's it's just the characters

116
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,045
Floyd is

117
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:27,560
Floyd is

118
00:12:27,897 --> 00:12:34,033
experimenting a lot with how much he can get away with and Al and a strip and they're just... The cleanest

119
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:35,229
sharpest,

120
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:39,772
most appealing mickey ever drawn and that strap. And

121
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:47,009
you know, if you were cartoon or with taste, why wouldn't you be influenced by that? Right? Absolutely.

122
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:53,953
You guys I I love the got person and story so much. It's it's one of those don't get me started.

123
00:12:54,553 --> 00:13:01,812
I know. I've I've bored friends with, like, did you know there was this error where Mickey was this scrappy

124
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:02,768
grass,

125
00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:05,519
you know, fire who who

126
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:07,130
was resourceful

127
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,890
any pee fist fought if he had many foil smugglers and opium dealers

128
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:14,784
and,

129
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,210
you know, then we got this, like, really milk toast

130
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:21,198
domestic version of Mickey that

131
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:24,283
just just left behind, you know, in the cartoons.

132
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:35,145
So much of the greatness. But but let me ask both of you. Do you have a couple of of favorite dot for and stories? Debbie. How about you? Let's see. That's a tough, but

133
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:38,096
one of them that immediately comes to mind

134
00:13:38,474 --> 00:13:38,974
is

135
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:40,627
island in the sky.

136
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,259
Not

137
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:49,283
pete and Al that. I love Island on the side. I would probably echo that. God

138
00:13:49,820 --> 00:14:05,962
himself. Was quoted as calling that one his favorite of his stories in one of his meetings with Karl Barks, laid and, you know, both in I think in the seven or so. And there's like an amusing note that that I read where both of them both of them

139
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:12,382
cop to really enjoying their own story called island in the scout because the course will be somewhere. Yeah.

140
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:36,145
And any others, Debbie? What what else? Let's see. I really like that. Well God didn't do it all the way through. I really liked that first one. Death Valley. Oh, yeah. What. To death Al twice to Al. It's kind of Al a weird start. But then it just says it picks up speed, you can tell when god and takes over the story starting

141
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:39,973
together a little better. Yeah. Yeah. These really

142
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:42,725
weird talk things at the beginning

143
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,375
where you'd have strips where it's like

144
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:53,075
four panels, but it's like it could have done a week's worth of strips with all the dialogue. They've put in those four panels.

145
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,707
Right and it's really worth

146
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,523
emphasis the fact that Gottfredson

147
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:00,701
was a newspaper.

148
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:07,558
Strip artist. Right? He who like you, Debbie. He's dealing in the medium of just a handful of panels,

149
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:18,794
unlike Barks, who got to work in ten and twenty four and thirty two pages. But he did such an amazing job of making these connect did

150
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:19,753
cohesive

151
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:38,815
stories that span weeks and months and and had to had a really defined arc that made it possible for the con companies to just kinda cut and paste and present them as common Barks later on. How about you said favorite Gottfredson

152
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:47,126
or notable ones? The one that comes immediately to mind is the foreign legion story with Trigger hawk and peg pete.

153
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:51,735
That one just... It keeps going and going. You... It's

154
00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:58,795
Al completely unpredictable story. It's one of the most tightly plotted ones that Floyd ever did.

155
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:01,148
I I know there are a lot of...

156
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:05,315
There's baggage with the whole concept of the foreign legion today. Absolutely.

157
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:13,001
But you you look at it as the piece for what it is. Know, there... It's a little progressive at one point because he does...

158
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,319
Mickey does

159
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:22,036
team up with the locals to capture the bad people. So so so it's sort of a companion to one of my favorite animated cartoons

160
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:38,330
Papa by Daily Bob forty t, which is an that is a great piece of animation. Yeah. That's that's my... That's probably my favorite of the pop I cartridge period. And that they they're they're good. They show those all those artists to set their strength. And

161
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:39,847
other favorites

162
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:45,688
will love trouble I mentioned that well that one's purely for the art and for it being a domestic comedy

163
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:46,566
And

164
00:16:47,582 --> 00:16:52,742
what's? I love seven goes too as well. Trying to think. Oh, gosh. Monarch of.

165
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:55,834
Oh, yeah. The basic... Basically,

166
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:59,582
you can't go wrong if listeners aren't familiar

167
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:00,794
with the

168
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:03,111
with these got and serial.

169
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:10,080
All of the Fan graphics books are worth buying But if you have to buy just a few get volumes

170
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,640
three through six of theirs

171
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:13,599
seriously...

172
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:19,002
You'd have to really stretch to say if there's anything weak in those books, specifically

173
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:21,393
four. Four...

174
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:26,909
Four is the top that that is the cream of the crop it has Island in the sky for legion,

175
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:28,762
seven ghosts and.

176
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:34,545
So that... Yeah. That four... If you need to cover blue golf

177
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:39,105
get volume for a that series. It's got goofy on the cover. So...

178
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:41,025
Yeah. The only... The only week

179
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,140
point is the the Robinson Scrooge.

180
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,679
Is it...

181
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,559
There's a couple of ethnic themes stories

182
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,283
Al that are not the best no sort...

183
00:17:54,779 --> 00:18:07,160
Yeah. There's... I think it's search of jungle treasures the week... Right. That's the name that's the that that story a mess and it's it's funny that, you know, peep people always say you can't be critical at Disney and stuff well,

184
00:18:07,814 --> 00:18:21,480
the commentary in that book, which David Wrote is very critical of that story, not just over the race connotation, but it's very messy otherwise. To Right. Right. And it's not just because of those ethnic stereotype.

185
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,680
But as you say, that that run of stories is truly incredible

186
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:34,205
as as far as my own taste, I mean, these are really obvious ones, but you guys mentioned the seven ghosts

187
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:47,677
That was such a revelation to me when I read that as a kid, I I couldn't believe the things that I saw keep doing in that one. And and, you know, everyone loves out with the phantom b. Yeah. Al

188
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,870
for a reason, I guess if I had to pick a couple of kind of odd ball stories,

189
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:59,725
some of the ones that he did with was it Bill Walsh Yeah. He

190
00:19:00,225 --> 00:19:03,325
they teamed up for a couple of really

191
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:07,125
weird and un unsettling creepy stories

192
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,580
there's the, like, tomorrow wars. I think it was titled at some point, and then

193
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,994
like, the the ghost pirates.

194
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:31,772
I don't remember the title that one, but Gladstone collected those two in one of those big albums they did and and they're just so on satellite. I have that one. I remember that. The world of tomorrow was what I think they thought that. Right. That's what it was title that time

195
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:35,897
title though. Yeah. But but they're just and monarch of.

196
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:45,135
I re reread that a few months ago, and it just it blew me away in in terms of of how tight it was. But anyway, we could we could obviously

197
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:49,322
ramble on about the brilliant Floyd Gottfredson

198
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:51,637
in this Carl Barks

199
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:53,073
podcast for a while.

200
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,533
This is what I had done with my one of my early episodes where I covered

201
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,201
too many packs, which Barks took over from Merrill D Mari

202
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:14,999
I was like, this is not a great story. So I'm I'm kinda gonna use this as an excuse to talk about God and his collaborations with with D. But

203
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:21,256
but this is even more of an excuse to talk about him. You guys before we get into

204
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:31,590
the the proper story. I wanna share a couple more of the the quotes I have, and then we can kinda talk about how Barks

205
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:38,310
started out with his involvement with Mick. Because like, he had a little bit more than this. Mh.

206
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:41,575
So another quote I really like from Barks

207
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:45,805
talking about Floyd. He said Dot for instance greatest

208
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:51,286
contribution to Comics was quality. Key you remembered for making

209
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:53,043
complex continuity

210
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,234
easy to understand and read And adds

211
00:20:57,772 --> 00:20:58,291
a more Al

212
00:20:59,064 --> 00:21:03,070
way of saying what I was just reaching for a couple minutes ago. And

213
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,700
one more. He he said

214
00:21:06,077 --> 00:21:17,242
Barks said it was the Mickey Mouse strip that he did that influenced my drawing more than anything else. Roy Crane, Prince Al, top by. These contributed

215
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:24,507
small things to my drawing style. It was all to help me adapt myself to Floyd way of drawing. So obviously,

216
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:25,679
super

217
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:28,835
super influential. Yeah. If you look at...

218
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:33,740
If you compare them, you know, a lot of the ways Sparks will draw characters,

219
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:36,393
profiles, it's very much

220
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:38,784
very much a child of God

221
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:46,630
style. And it it just showed, like, Barks did not pay. The Barks did not pay mine to any other of his contemporary

222
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,165
very much

223
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:53,305
But what what I was found interesting is that G was younger than Barks.

224
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,699
And especially in those days, people

225
00:21:57,156 --> 00:21:59,508
generally did not look to someone younger. I mean,

226
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:09,940
floyd was only maybe about four or five years younger than Carl, but in those days, that that's a big leap. Because, like, if you look at... If you look at people, like you know,

227
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:14,596
at the warner studio, you know, tech avery was only maybe about

228
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:21,050
four, or five years older than Chuck Jones and Bob Lamp but they still saw him as the elder and the mentor.

229
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:31,895
So Yeah. That then... And it it's probably still holds true today too. So so that just showed, you know, the how powerful and influence Floyd Got was on Carl. Right.

230
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:38,863
Debbie, would you say that you're you're influenced in your drawing style by by either of the user artists?

231
00:22:39,622 --> 00:22:41,561
Maybe to a small degree.

232
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:42,614
Certainly,

233
00:22:43,072 --> 00:23:01,705
it sometimes I have to go and red draw Mer so he doesn't look like mickey those. Like pretty much the same nose. And if I get make nervous nose too small, it's like, wait, No. You're just drew nikki. Right. I feel like he's just in our cultural, like, in our brains. He just thinks out.

234
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:03,945
So you guys

235
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:09,870
bark as I mentioned, he this was not his very first involvement

236
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:23,937
with Nikki. So so that, I know that you know a lot about this. And you're you're a big bigger animation buff than I am. So feel free to chime in. Sure Debbie, if you know anything about business as well.

237
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:37,085
But what I understand is that Barb actually got his star. This was mentioned by David Ge and in that great. Feature. He gotta a start by submitting a couple of mickey mouse publicity.

238
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,083
Drawings

239
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:57,289
two Disney, and and that they liked that enough to just outright higher him. And and he got to work as an in between for some of the early Mickey mouse cartoons, but I my understanding is he's like, un credited oh, for the. No artist wherever credited. Up until maybe

240
00:23:57,668 --> 00:24:03,402
towards the end of World war two on any of the shorts. So Right. Yeah. No no chance

241
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:08,006
carl Carl or floyd or whatever got gotten a credit at that position.

242
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:10,477
He did a couple of things

243
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:14,079
David outlines in his article that bark did...

244
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:15,215
What was it?

245
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:29,725
Northwest mount there was like It was like a story of Mickey as a mount, and it's done very much in the got and style, but a quoting, quoting from that article, Barks said, pretty wild and two logical for wall taste.

246
00:24:30,378 --> 00:24:35,584
So it it kinda was set Gladstone what they wanted Nikki to be in those cartoons.

247
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,665
And it sure wasn't what was going on in the funny page

248
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:48,915
Right. I think even included the horse tango foot in those story Barks. Oh, yeah. Did. He did. Right that be. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

249
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:53,501
Look somewhere. It was supposed to be tango foot first

250
00:24:54,079 --> 00:25:04,726
animated appearance. I mean, he might... I think he's technically in something earlier, but that just shows how big of an influence was on Carl that he brought back you this

251
00:25:05,063 --> 00:25:07,576
random character from Right. This Barks.

252
00:25:08,229 --> 00:25:09,688
Yeah. Exactly. And

253
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:19,650
he... Bark ends up using... He recycles a gag from that for sheriff of Bullet Al. Mh. And and so he ended up getting linked

254
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:35,283
when that didn't quite pan out and that that never got released. He got linked with the story in Harry Reeves. Who I understand was basically a Donald duct man. Right. And it seems like that just kind of set Barks on that path. Right.

255
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:39,830
And so he he just end up sticking with the Donald staple of characters.

256
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,180
But but he did do, like, a random

257
00:25:43,597 --> 00:25:44,097
pluto

258
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,063
story. I guess Pluto saves the ship was technically

259
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:54,145
his very first. Yeah. Either of you read it. I I I think it was in the old

260
00:25:55,002 --> 00:26:12,090
Barks library, but right looked in smaller things because Barks didn't do the art. Right. But he did do the story for it and another person drew it. It was mostly a pant month thing, which makes sense for Pluto. Right. Exactly. Yeah. I've never gotten there beat it myself.

261
00:26:12,724 --> 00:26:19,316
I'll have to I'll have to seek it out at some point. But as you say, he didn't he didn't do the art. He just plotted it. So... Right.

262
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,710
Donald Duck finds Pirate gold, you know, his collaboration with

263
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,870
his his jack hannah

264
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,470
collaboration with his fellow

265
00:26:29,263 --> 00:26:42,862
is is more properly thought of as his first story. As can say Barks also did contribute a couple of gigs to the don't Inducks newspaper strip. I didn't know that. That's cool. I don't remember the dates on them. But in the in the

266
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,700
High

267
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:47,905
library of American comics, they mentioned a couple of day

268
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:49,661
Nice. What figured

269
00:26:50,198 --> 00:26:55,741
the the gag for a couple of strips. And you're talking about the the A Al fe?

270
00:26:56,259 --> 00:27:01,330
Yeah. They also I fe. Eat, I think contributed a couple of gigs to that. Absolutely

271
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:11,845
enough. And so I I guess it wasn't too long after he had done Pirate gold that he did get to do this Mickey story. It's surprisingly

272
00:27:12,183 --> 00:27:28,132
early in his career. I my count he only did four of the longer what I call adventure length stories Mh. And and and about a couple dozen of the, like, ten pages are close to ten pages. So this this was pretty early.

273
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:44,793
I I guess it's is good a time as I to mention the the background of the story, rid of the rent hat appeared in four color numbers seventy nine in August of nineteen forty five. So I guess we are in the the hyatt of World War two at that point. Mh.

274
00:27:45,591 --> 00:28:11,486
It feels like I'm traveling back in time. You know, I covered the early stories last year. This one has kind of an average number of prints. I usually mentioned that. We've got nine of them including the original It's it's short. It's a it's eleven pages. So one page longer than is typical, like, ten page story. But it definitely has the feel of his adventure story. Mh. Yeah. This came at a period when.

275
00:28:12,144 --> 00:28:13,322
It's it's fascinating

276
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,598
to to look at it.

277
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:18,671
Because go... I I meant to mention it in that

278
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:20,284
Facebook messenger

279
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:42,782
threat of ours. Mh. But this was a period where the editors at Western were treating Barks is if he was just any other, you know, cartoon it's like, they did not... I mean, they kind of did know his niche was me was the was the Ducktales but, you know, he's getting assigned this, he's getting... He got assigned a pork pig story. He gotta assigned a couple with

280
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:54,085
the tech Severino character Droop, and then I what with the Mgm character, the organizing creation, Barney bear. Right. And and and finally,

281
00:28:54,582 --> 00:29:01,414
you know, I think Carl what his foot down and, you know, I'm not doing any of these other characters

282
00:29:02,688 --> 00:29:04,305
I know we were saying that,

283
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,575
you know, those might not be our favorite stories, but

284
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:14,969
I do love those barney bears stores because you just know, Carl did not care at all about those characters.

285
00:29:15,307 --> 00:29:20,775
And, you know, there's there's a certain level of cy and the Ducktales stories of those years.

286
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:30,649
I mean, is like, roughly forty four to forty seven, but the barney Barks stuff is just amped up, like all the way. And it's like there's so

287
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:34,824
means Spirited. And he did... And that was one of the few times.

288
00:29:35,444 --> 00:29:36,704
Carl was complimentary

289
00:29:37,204 --> 00:29:39,544
of the other cartoon and Riders

290
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,750
at Western because a lot of the best stuff

291
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:49,344
a lot of those best barney stories weren't written by Carl. A lot of them were written by Guild turn another.

292
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:58,054
I think I don't remember if Gil was at Disney at all, but he was mainly M mgm. So that was how he got that gig. But... Yeah.

293
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:07,624
This one, I don't know how either of you first saw this, but it my for six exposure was in the nineteen

294
00:30:08,004 --> 00:30:10,544
eighty nine ninety Nikki and Donald

295
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:16,479
Reed. From Glass. And that's why I first saw that one too. Yeah. It sounds like

296
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:39,600
meet... Me as well. It sounds like we all got this from the same source. Well, I think that's all It appeared in. I think that it... I don't have the index in front of me, but I think that was as first three reprint Severino close to it. Got it. I I noted this in my, like, interesting fax. This is by far. The biggest gap that I've seen doing this podcast

297
00:30:39,978 --> 00:30:49,516
between the first printing and the second printing. Nineteen forty five to nineteen eighty eight, because it is. It appeared just a little bit earlier in

298
00:30:50,094 --> 00:30:54,210
mickey Mouse color, I guess, that big lavish collection.

299
00:30:54,624 --> 00:31:01,244
As an aside, it always cracks me up that that book, Mickey Mouse color is credited. By Floyd God

300
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:02,344
and Carl.

301
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:05,876
Which kind of under cells Gottfredson

302
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:26,091
and really good. Yeah. That was... It was it was very weird that that advertising, like, playing carl up as if he was like a prominent mouse coming in the same size. I know. It's it's... It was very strange. And they were, like, emphasizing, you know, these They they made a selling point like that it had, like, his in between from the

303
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,104
nineteen thirty six short through the mirror and it's like well,

304
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:33,932
cares, can you just give it all the floyd just this one time. I mean.

305
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:57,299
That's a great point, but I'm I'm glad you mentioned that because I saw I saw that mentioned on I think, I d and it just said on credit. So I was thinking to myself. Is that is that not confirmed? Because I love that. Cartoon too. That's right. Like, among my favorite of the Mickey shorts Right. Yeah. Your fan. It's... Oh, it's didn't really

306
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,099
you didn't really need him to have much of a

307
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:26,508
personality as... It it is just a pure spec. And that's right one of the things they were doing in that period that really worked was they were building up to the a snow white feature that was when they were just getting better and better with every short. Right. Because like was so bland in the questions that you needed like this high concept like username. Oh, the the funny thing too is that Carl

308
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:29,044
when he talked about this later,

309
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:34,024
when he was asked about doing this story later, he had no memory

310
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:57,920
of it. He... There there's a quote that says strange to say, this was in in a nineteen seventy response to a fan letter. Strange to say I had completely forgotten the story reading it I could see my drawing in the artwork. My old pay vouchers prove that I did do the art. So I'll puff out my chest and Brad that I did a pretty fair. Mickey and Goofy. Barks also

311
00:32:58,495 --> 00:33:00,350
did this story for this.

312
00:33:00,726 --> 00:33:01,159
There's

313
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:09,014
probably a lot... You know, you might read some of it online, like, you know, speculation or that, but I did confirm

314
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:16,094
when Barks told me, you know, if you wanna do this episode, you know, I made sure I did the research by asking David,

315
00:33:17,488 --> 00:33:19,426
But the David says Carl

316
00:33:19,845 --> 00:33:29,714
records did show that he was paid for story and the art. He didn't he didn't come up with to concept their idea, but he... This is his writing in his dialogue.

317
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:31,714
Okay. So probably,

318
00:33:32,294 --> 00:33:33,874
probably what's his name

319
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:34,969
you

320
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:38,889
I have given him a springboard or something.

321
00:33:39,189 --> 00:33:58,091
Right. But Debbie, what do you think about Karl comment there that he did they a pretty fair, mickey and goofy. Yeah. He the the interesting thing about it. And I'm sure we'll note that more as we go through it. Is that while his nikki and minnie and the rest, the may not always be on model. They're very

322
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:58,909
expressive.

323
00:33:59,324 --> 00:34:16,950
Is Goofy is kinda weird, but even he's still expressive there too. Yeah. I I think I agree with with you. I his goofy, I find a little off putting, but I do like he's many and Mickey. Alright. You guys this has been a really great pre, but I I gotta a discipline myself a little

324
00:34:17,384 --> 00:34:32,649
We gotta get into the actual story. No problem. So let's see. So you guys rid of the red hat opens up It's it's a very kind of as you say, like, you mentioned it some of the stories are more domestic than others.

325
00:34:33,246 --> 00:34:35,301
It kind of has this domestic

326
00:34:36,053 --> 00:34:36,553
opening

327
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:40,742
where Mickey and Minnie are doing some window shopping.

328
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,683
Many is doing the window shopping. And and she is Al

329
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:47,575
a very, like freely

330
00:34:47,992 --> 00:34:52,932
red hat in a store window. And Mickey is looking at it, kind skeptical

331
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,922
saying it looks sorta of silly to him.

332
00:34:56,897 --> 00:34:58,393
And most of this,

333
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:05,749
most of the first opening page is taken up with her just ad me it him being skeptical

334
00:35:06,886 --> 00:35:15,954
and and her just going in and buying it. And and we get this, like, this feels very much like a kind of a hack need

335
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:16,889
stand up

336
00:35:17,786 --> 00:35:18,924
comics, like

337
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:36,933
women be shopping joke a little bit. Right? Because she comes out, it's obviously the latest style or or bark sub position of what the latest style might be And he starts cracking up Al her saying that she looks exactly like a comic valentine

338
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:46,165
and she is, you know, she reacts as you might expect a girlfriend who's been humiliated

339
00:35:46,902 --> 00:35:52,409
to, and she gives him the cold shoulder and strides away and he kind of for

340
00:35:52,749 --> 00:35:54,889
Barks off and encounters Cla

341
00:35:55,189 --> 00:35:55,509
cow.

342
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:59,489
Yeah. Al first page is pretty much seems like standard

343
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,144
duffy you'd see and the Sunday page is.

344
00:36:02,444 --> 00:36:18,209
Nikki has some interesting expressions in there. Like, they look on his face in the second panel where he's good Al hand up and got this. Yeah. Look on his face. Mh. And one of the god and wipes in the fourth panel.

345
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:21,078
Yes. Where he's standing there with his hand,

346
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:24,924
and even the waist. His Barks are tilted. Mh.

347
00:36:25,562 --> 00:36:26,062
How

348
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,189
leaking from one of the strips

349
00:36:28,649 --> 00:36:30,669
Mh. Yeah. As I said earlier,

350
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:34,629
this is all straight out of Love trouble, the domestic

351
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:41,781
situation. And even including the local gossip Cla cow introducing her just for a couple of panels

352
00:36:42,237 --> 00:36:45,224
that shows you know, Carl was paying attention.

353
00:36:45,561 --> 00:36:54,929
I mean, I mean, Carl was a fan of that strip to knew those characters. And he got his job drawing that he drawing them. Is pitch to Disney. And...

354
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,802
Because I don't...

355
00:36:57,417 --> 00:37:00,839
I I my memory is fuzzy on a lot of

356
00:37:01,577 --> 00:37:04,946
the comic book... The original comic book stories of the period.

357
00:37:05,442 --> 00:37:08,612
But I don't think Claire was too regulars

358
00:37:09,044 --> 00:37:12,615
so... And even at that point, she was fading out of the god

359
00:37:12,952 --> 00:37:16,045
strip, but, you know, there she is, he and

360
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:19,768
clearly, only a god fan would think conclude.

361
00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:21,562
You know, she gives

362
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:27,914
mickey some advice. You a Must never size the girls hand. You gotta apologize to her

363
00:37:28,494 --> 00:37:30,872
toner down them to get the box of candy.

364
00:37:31,211 --> 00:37:31,711
And...

365
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:47,801
Yeah. I'm... You know, I you said it's a one if, but it's interesting what if but, you, I'm glad Carl didn't do anymore because, you know, it's... I I mean, he did the best job he possibly could, but it this clearly is just him going through the motions.

366
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,679
Yeah. He he's not really, like bringing anything

367
00:37:51,058 --> 00:37:57,086
new or special to the table. It's it's it's a it's a find opening here. You you mentioned

368
00:37:57,665 --> 00:38:07,084
that oh, yeah. We've so we've got Cla here. It's nice to see as you say, he knows how to use the stable of supporting characters.

369
00:38:07,582 --> 00:38:12,430
It it shows you that he really did follow Gottfredson.

370
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:21,344
You know, like this this inclusion here. Because there are other times when you read writing about Barks that it's clear that he didn't really

371
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:36,255
follow a lot of the the work that the Disney studio No. Was putting out later on. So I I find it notable that he like clearly did know and appreciate. Floyd. So onto to the next page as you say,

372
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:44,227
Cla gives him this this piece of of advice and he goes off to make good and make amend with minnie.

373
00:38:44,763 --> 00:38:47,057
He buys a nice box of chocolate

374
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:51,322
and and he spots her by that really ga

375
00:38:51,953 --> 00:39:06,480
hat that stands out so much. And and the whole point of this page is to give us this little double take a moment where he taps, mini on the shoulder, and it turns out to be this really

376
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:08,680
is really unpleasant looking

377
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:16,634
mouse or rat woman character that only looks like me from behind. Mh. And and she immediately

378
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:26,999
sc him saying not so loud you don't and and we start to get the inkling that there's like, this case of mistaken identity more than more than

379
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:32,370
what we're were initially see. What do you guys think about about the rap girl? She's hideous.

380
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,025
She really is.

381
00:39:36,478 --> 00:39:42,318
I remember reading this the first time, It it... It Barks upon. You you do not expect this whatsoever.

382
00:39:42,934 --> 00:39:46,924
And this is showing Barks of skill at... What's the word

383
00:39:48,664 --> 00:39:50,364
mis direction and staging.

384
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:55,019
Because there's no you have no inclination Al the is not minnie mouse.

385
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:03,594
And you have this test feature. She's got... Basically got... You know, this is another love trouble reference basically got more to mouse features,

386
00:40:04,054 --> 00:40:05,354
you know, the now

387
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:12,047
and they go up to the roof. It's really striking to me how unpleasant she looks with so little.

388
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:24,107
Like yeah. It's got a mad magazine drawing or anything. He didn't go that far, but, no. It it it does the job. And and many is just always coded as so

389
00:40:24,485 --> 00:40:25,704
incredibly feminine

390
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:41,544
and and soft. Even when she's angry, she's usually soft So I think that's why this is so jarring. The same interesting thing to note is looking up at this page. Look at the third panel on the top of the page. You see some guy riding a cycle oh.

391
00:40:42,964 --> 00:40:44,144
It's a good catch.

392
00:40:45,578 --> 00:40:53,864
That's that's sparks all the way. Yeah. It's kind of pre... Pre dates when he would have characters writing those little one wheel card. With

393
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:54,524
introduced.

394
00:40:55,364 --> 00:41:00,384
Yeah. Because God wasn't really one for the background. Gag. I imagine.

395
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:05,195
I imagine that half the time he didn't have the space, especially in the forties.

396
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:05,654
Yeah.

397
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:21,222
Exactly. In a in a newspaper strip. It's not something you you can't really distract from your punch line that way, I guess. So you mentioned they go up to the rooftop, she's kinda leading him there and and and I I like some of the little

398
00:41:21,878 --> 00:41:22,656
that are

399
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:27,054
just reminding us that were in the mid forties here, you know, the elevator

400
00:41:27,788 --> 00:41:31,156
operator. And and Mickey is very confused

401
00:41:31,508 --> 00:41:32,327
she's basically

402
00:41:32,982 --> 00:41:42,634
pushing him into this like, exchange. She's saying, what... What's the problem here? I'm wearing the red hat you're carrying the box of candy.

403
00:41:42,974 --> 00:41:45,194
You know, anyone who's seen like a Hollywood

404
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:46,089
feature,

405
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:47,449
a Spy

406
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:52,729
probably has an ink inkling that this is one of those, like, Mh. Criminal

407
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:53,809
exchanges

408
00:41:54,644 --> 00:41:59,584
But but for the sake of the story, Mickey has to be really confused. He doesn't

409
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:07,594
understand what's going on. And she instruct him to take the small package that she gives him to mister Who's

410
00:42:08,013 --> 00:42:20,075
right away. And when he tries to follow her, he is he's stopped by the elevator operator. I like the panel, where did the... Where you see the oven elevator doors shutting and then you see Nikki

411
00:42:20,429 --> 00:42:23,300
at this funny angle, you never see him at. Yeah.

412
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:44,370
Here in that sort of strange way and is nose sticking up. Right. He runs smack into it. Kind of flattens his ears. That that feels like maybe Barks was like, well, what what can I do with Mickey and his anatomy? You know, something they didn't have a model sheet for. It's like what that look like. Right. I I feel good.

413
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:52,795
Tell me what you think, Debbie because you probably have a better eye for this, but I I feel like we're seeing Nikki at slightly different angles.

414
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:54,327
Than what Gottfredson

415
00:42:54,566 --> 00:43:00,535
would have typically drawn Yeah. A few of them, like the third panel there. You have

416
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:22,083
nikki and not many. Up in the top at this sort of dramatic angle. Where you see the cities escape there kind of at an angle where she's kind of pointing outside of the panel than that one. And again, you see all these city drawings that look like later, how Barks with draw Duck berg Yeah. Mh. And definitely

417
00:43:22,502 --> 00:43:28,795
says, hey. Well, there's a lot more use of still silhouette this story and that was not something God ever

418
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:30,367
particularly use

419
00:43:31,024 --> 00:43:52,810
unless, you know, he was doing a really dramatic stage. I honestly can't think of one off my head. I mean, that's literally seldom them me used it. But Carl used so it's all the time even to the point where that model that model sheet you get have Inducks in nineteen fifth get a little gag in the corners and Don't try send those so all the time.

420
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:54,522
Right

421
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,360
But

422
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,995
no. It's it's it's interesting

423
00:43:58,852 --> 00:43:59,352
that

424
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:02,359
now... Now we see that Mickey got this

425
00:44:02,938 --> 00:44:12,630
package, and he's gonna go to the straight to the police. Now that's definitely a non... I don't know if that... If it's particularly a god a approach to Mickey here.

426
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:14,066
Because then definitely,

427
00:44:14,523 --> 00:44:17,456
you see a generic policeman on the next page.

428
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:24,012
Yeah not here. Yeah. Exact that's exact. That I was gonna say no cheap hair or no detective Casey.

429
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:27,921
So that... That's Al that was an interesting... That... Well, it's a departure

430
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:34,848
you know, only because, you know, Carl care might have cared enough about Cla, but he didn't wanna put, you know, the usual

431
00:44:35,227 --> 00:44:37,919
got cops in this one. Right.

432
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,254
Why don't you tell us about this page that Yeah. The this is interesting.

433
00:44:43,033 --> 00:44:46,145
Vicky brings the package and, you know, it's...

434
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:52,705
Diamond ring, and it's like, no, It's not a diamond ring. It's a hun of glass. And he gets dismissed for the

435
00:44:53,005 --> 00:44:56,716
pretty harshly, I gotta say that's it's a very un

436
00:44:57,173 --> 00:44:59,786
type exchange because, you know, he's telling

437
00:45:00,123 --> 00:45:06,502
them basically, stop wasting our time here, and it's almost I'm gonna but he's helping him that Right.

438
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:16,974
Because he puts the... He puts the... And he puts the police officer and it's so add for that panel. And then Nikki rejected runs into Goofy and as we know,

439
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:20,683
this is deaf... Val this is beck where. It is. Go little god

440
00:45:21,061 --> 00:45:21,340
influence.

441
00:45:21,994 --> 00:45:37,152
Goofy always through shea stupidity and by accident then, he finds out what's what's up with this ring. And turns out there's something in there, I it's a Gladstone ruby. Right? Yeah. If you mean if you need to move the plot along,

442
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:39,704
a little bit of of goofy

443
00:45:40,121 --> 00:45:40,600
dipping,

444
00:45:41,055 --> 00:45:43,855
is is what what it takes. What do you think, Debbie?

445
00:45:44,535 --> 00:45:57,741
Than the fact that I think that is probably not one of the best drawings of goofy when he first shows up. Mh. No. Yeah. That that very first goofy panel is kind of on a unnatural pose

446
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:10,204
He might have had... He might don't have had rep too many references for Goofy. I I've got an I'm wondering if love trouble might have been reprinted around the time he was working on this

447
00:46:10,741 --> 00:46:20,672
story as to why he might have used it to model so many other things, but the Barks he might have had to use might not have had too many usable drawings of goofy

448
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:29,827
Right. Yeah. You know, I've always thought that of the... What do they calling? The fab five, if you're talking about kind of the main Disney

449
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,120
domestic characters,

450
00:46:32,494 --> 00:46:36,502
Goofy gotta be the hardest of them to draw. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

451
00:46:37,118 --> 00:46:43,900
I've tried to draw a goofy. He is a pain the neck to draw. Mh. Yeah. He's all... He's all like these weird

452
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:44,740
joints,

453
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,680
and he's so much more stretched out.

454
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:55,942
Even his hat is life stretched out. So Yeah. It's it's fun seeing Barks version. Of goofy, but

455
00:46:56,438 --> 00:47:00,825
but it definitely looks a little more jarring than, like his... I I settle in.

456
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:14,241
Pretty quickly into, like, buying his version of Mickey, I think. As I read this story. And and many, I I really like his version of many here. But But goofy just looks a little bit jarring.

457
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,496
Yeah. Goofy is an example of how fat how

458
00:47:19,248 --> 00:47:20,148
unique Disney

459
00:47:20,685 --> 00:47:34,370
design word got. And of course, Goofy was introduced in the early black and white cartoons. I'm not too early, but like, you know, midway through the black and white run. But, you know, because nikki is just a knock off of a lot of other care

460
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:39,810
really in design wise, but Goofy is a more interesting

461
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,543
combination of shape and curves

462
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,380
and...

463
00:47:43,797 --> 00:47:44,656
Yeah. It's

464
00:47:45,034 --> 00:47:51,370
not really for the faint of heart to try him master. They're they're... And that's why a lot of modern

465
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,850
combinations of goofy looks so unpleasant and sometimes.

466
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:59,450
But he doesn't do too badly here. There's a couple that

467
00:48:00,004 --> 00:48:02,902
are pretty clearly conference and crib.

468
00:48:03,361 --> 00:48:05,878
That one was, like, kind pretty though ain't it, you know,

469
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,150
that that looks like that's a face from a guy

470
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:13,670
Scrooge. Right. Yeah. So on the next page, we

471
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,510
figure out a little bit more and

472
00:48:17,384 --> 00:48:22,693
As you mentioned, he surmise that it's a ruby. I always like seeing the word home ding.

473
00:48:24,489 --> 00:48:28,676
When when Goofy asked his is ruby worth a lot of dough, mickey.

474
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:37,672
He says I'll say it is, and this one's a home ding. And and so Nicky is not gonna go back to the police. I guess that's why the

475
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:46,109
that cop was so hard on him Barks needed to give a reason for him not to approach the police again. So he

476
00:48:46,726 --> 00:48:50,059
says that he'd like goofy to hide

477
00:48:50,437 --> 00:48:52,431
the the ruby because, you know,

478
00:48:53,164 --> 00:49:01,980
whoever's has been smuggling this or passing it off won't suspect him. This seems like a little bit of a logical leap to meet you guys sometimes

479
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:03,338
So Goofy

480
00:49:03,676 --> 00:49:05,312
hides it in his shoe.

481
00:49:05,951 --> 00:49:08,087
But this this might be my favorite

482
00:49:08,424 --> 00:49:11,395
panel of goofy here with his yes.

483
00:49:12,235 --> 00:49:14,135
Foot sticking out through his

484
00:49:15,195 --> 00:49:20,167
socks that are totally falling apart. Right. But we definitely needs a new pair of socks.

485
00:49:20,766 --> 00:49:25,621
Yeah. Well, I'm surprised Carl held back. He doesn't really have Goofy patented whole

486
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,906
shoe haul there, you know? Because that was such a common commonality.

487
00:49:30,323 --> 00:49:37,039
And that was true. But I know what the... In mind printing here, it kinda looks like there's a little circle. Yeah.

488
00:49:38,117 --> 00:49:38,617
Color.

489
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:49,808
Maybe Huey, gotta reach... Maybe you got an una approved re tread since this is still World war too, who knows I was thinking this might be one of those instances of an overly aggressive color.

490
00:49:50,145 --> 00:49:50,344
Right.

491
00:49:50,982 --> 00:49:59,352
Not not realizing that's supposed to be a hold. Yeah. I think that's my be might be right. I'm looking at it. Yeah. That and whoever

492
00:50:00,009 --> 00:50:04,753
the modern colors just went that way. Yeah. I think Carl was trying to draw Goofy

493
00:50:05,492 --> 00:50:08,669
shoe haul. This page also has another great panel

494
00:50:09,367 --> 00:50:10,746
after mickey Goofy

495
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,880
side to go see, mister Hu.

496
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,980
There's this great panel is the one two the... Yeah. Seventh panel.

497
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,720
It's where minnie

498
00:50:19,195 --> 00:50:20,433
surrounded by all these blockers.

499
00:50:20,912 --> 00:50:24,488
Everyone is knocking at her and she's doesn't notice

500
00:50:24,947 --> 00:50:29,297
Pete is behind or she's just to overcome with her humiliation, and she's,

501
00:50:29,796 --> 00:50:29,995
you know,

502
00:50:30,755 --> 00:50:35,944
realizing maybe Mickey was right about this, you know, candy cane months us she's wearing.

503
00:50:37,002 --> 00:50:41,977
And, no. This just shows, you know, even at this is only Barks is third year

504
00:50:42,676 --> 00:50:52,555
drawing comic books full time. And it's just a... Your your eye is on mini, but all this other stuff is going on. A lot is going on. You've got you got this

505
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:53,633
this

506
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:56,584
one rich ladies looking back and the news

507
00:50:56,962 --> 00:51:01,290
newspaper boy, Al little kid, and you got pete looking over her ominous

508
00:51:01,707 --> 00:51:04,218
as well. So... Oh and it's also

509
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:05,257
nineteen

510
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:12,980
forties. Mh. It's great. You're you're right. That is a great stand out panel. And, yeah, we've got Pete

511
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:14,137
a costing

512
00:51:14,475 --> 00:51:14,975
mini

513
00:51:15,752 --> 00:51:24,488
say, you know, telling grabbing her very forced fully and saying. What's the idea break in our date? I've been waiting and waiting up on the roof.

514
00:51:24,986 --> 00:51:34,254
So, you know, we were further figuring out that the is a case of mistaken and identity here. You guys, I'm on record Al being a huge fan of pete.

515
00:51:35,371 --> 00:51:41,446
I I love the early Barks stories where he used him as a foil for for the dots.

516
00:51:42,004 --> 00:51:46,252
This one feels a little weirdly off model to me and and

517
00:51:46,644 --> 00:52:01,890
He's a little bit too sm for my taste. Yeah. I gonna say he does look a little off here, but everybody looks Al little odd you kinda makes you wonder if he wasn't like, okay. I really don't wanna do this story, so I just have run it through. Right

518
00:52:02,364 --> 00:52:10,437
the... Yeah. There there's better looking keys by Barks. Even in his amazon's lori board panels when you did, he did several

519
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:17,162
donald Inducks cartoons with pete. And portia, it wouldn't be a Mickey mystery without a kid kidnapping,

520
00:52:18,221 --> 00:52:18,721
many

521
00:52:19,114 --> 00:52:19,614
is

522
00:52:19,952 --> 00:52:22,727
caused by pete again and taking for a ride

523
00:52:23,424 --> 00:52:33,317
and he's gonna take her to see who it because he thinks they've all been double crossed with the ring. And there's just... I mentioned in our chad this one panel,

524
00:52:34,094 --> 00:52:38,565
Yeah. One two three, four five six panel six on page six

525
00:52:39,305 --> 00:52:48,807
where he's got the pistol and mini face. Don't make any noise sister there. You won't ever yell again. That... This really calls to mind a lot of god

526
00:52:49,144 --> 00:53:10,624
strips where there's been an abduction, you know, because I I can't call quite recall Barks using this again, but it's like you wanted to use it once. There's one beautiful one and the foreign legion story where Mickey is in the back see. You gotta look at that one that that impressed so many of my kirk friends when I just posted the panel, but this one's pretty... This one's pretty

527
00:53:11,081 --> 00:53:14,052
terrifying because many sweating bullets immediately.

528
00:53:14,509 --> 00:53:35,685
Yeah. It is great panel. You're right. Her fear is really Al yeah. I really love that expression on her face. She's like that's another one of those that... Yeah. It's off model, but it's off model for good reason. Mh. Well, I've I had at least one director friend of mine say. It's not off model if you recognize the character.

529
00:53:36,858 --> 00:53:46,505
But I can definitely see where, you know, you don't wanna go too far because these aren't type of characters where you do a lot of distortion with.

530
00:53:47,104 --> 00:53:53,419
And Barks figure that out very quickly and who's our. Right. And I feel like we're not really that customs

531
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:56,059
to Severino many like this

532
00:53:56,519 --> 00:54:05,831
afraid. I mean... She's been in real danger in the God person's and stories before, but, like, she's She's afraid her her life here. And and so we

533
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:11,305
transition as as Pete is heading with her to who's it? Mick Goof.

534
00:54:11,978 --> 00:54:16,027
Very quaint looking him up in the phone book as one did,

535
00:54:16,404 --> 00:54:23,223
and they find that he lives at Boulevard and the rich part of town is as Goofy points out.

536
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:28,177
And it really is a nice stage run

537
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,815
lavish mansion

538
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:43,904
And I I like what Goofy says here. Mickey says here's the place sure a swell one, isn't it and Goofy says, yep, but the guy that lives in there couldn't be no crook. He must be a millionaire.

539
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:53,570
And and there's a lot of a lot of things that one could say in response to them. But but I think they're already there on this subject.

540
00:54:54,465 --> 00:54:59,505
Say the building there almost looks like you'd expect to see Scrooge duck come out the door,

541
00:55:00,065 --> 00:55:01,085
shoot them away.

542
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,295
I was thinking it looked a lot like f t alex

543
00:55:05,794 --> 00:55:06,294
mansion.

544
00:55:06,952 --> 00:55:09,402
And. In the guild man, Just.

545
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:16,918
Out of that, just my memory here. On the next page, we've got Nikki and Goofy kinda considering their options.

546
00:55:17,788 --> 00:55:24,309
Talking about call... Goofy wants to call the police, but then Mickey ends up seeing that really

547
00:55:24,726 --> 00:55:30,471
distinct hat of menus. And so he he feels like he has to scale the fence

548
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:31,350
while

549
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:33,028
while goofy worries

550
00:55:33,447 --> 00:55:38,080
basically about about him and gets ready to call the police if necessary.

551
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,240
Mickey cancels him

552
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:49,050
don't lose your shoe because, of course, that movie is in there. I do like du he's gosh. Oh, he says gosh, not in ga.

553
00:55:51,138 --> 00:55:54,130
He says gosh. How could I lose it? It's tied on my foot.

554
00:55:54,967 --> 00:55:57,475
And, you know, to his horror, he does

555
00:55:58,255 --> 00:56:05,330
recognize the label that it must be minnie hat since it's from the R Hatch shop. And in that moment, Pete

556
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:07,970
snatch, mickey as well

557
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:08,770
and

558
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:15,465
plans to bring him to the boss as goofy runs off. So you guys we've got some

559
00:56:15,885 --> 00:56:29,313
acceleration here. Those a couple of nice panels too with pea grabbing nikki. You've got this really nice. Sweet action there and then Goofy running off at the bottom of the page, both have some very

560
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:31,170
innovative looking action.

561
00:56:31,904 --> 00:56:38,118
Yeah. I like that one of of pete mid grab with Mickey. That we don't really get any recognition.

562
00:56:38,457 --> 00:56:41,050
If this were Gottfredson in there would be some

563
00:56:41,626 --> 00:56:57,381
back and forth between Mickey and pete. Right? Right. It's pretty much to get us from point eight to point b here. Right. It's says this, you know, now now thinking about now that you've made that point, it's almost as a... Whatever

564
00:56:57,959 --> 00:56:59,297
springboard he might have gotten

565
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,788
just called for a generic

566
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:09,174
tough guy and Barks just included pete because, you know, well, that's the... That's the guy some tough guy.

567
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:23,054
You do. And they needed a villain and and anything. They often just went to pee You guys are old hands at Disney. So I'm sure you know this, but one of my favorite fun fax is that pete actually pre dates making that. Yes.

568
00:57:24,772 --> 00:57:28,402
So the next page is we've got a goofy sequence

569
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:30,176
in in Severino sense.

570
00:57:31,134 --> 00:57:32,272
We've got goofy

571
00:57:33,009 --> 00:57:34,440
running to get help

572
00:57:35,098 --> 00:57:40,282
and he doesn't get very far before. Debbie, do you wanna tell us about this this sequence?

573
00:57:41,239 --> 00:57:43,825
Sure. Got kinda stop. He's got this

574
00:57:44,205 --> 00:57:44,705
ouch.

575
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:47,685
Must have some little stones and the shoes.

576
00:57:48,085 --> 00:57:50,840
Sure hurts when I run, and it looks like it hurt

577
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:58,431
I a holding cat in the panel. Yeah. He stops and piece out his shoes, which I'm sure everybody reading the book

578
00:57:58,784 --> 00:58:00,879
snacks there for it going no.

579
00:58:03,169 --> 00:58:05,463
And yeah. Know I can make time.

580
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,107
Just gonna say next jeez. Goes to the police office

581
00:58:09,484 --> 00:58:17,003
there's is like to tell them what's going on. They don't bother us we're busy. The famous v ruby has been stolen.

582
00:58:18,033 --> 00:58:21,445
This this is where the p gets a little

583
00:58:21,782 --> 00:58:22,282
messi

584
00:58:22,739 --> 00:58:33,463
because I have to imagine that there there had to be some real change for, you know, there there had to be some sort of substantial reason why the police ignored goofy

585
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:38,265
when he's coming to them for help. About, you know, their top. Their top

586
00:58:39,806 --> 00:58:42,466
the freelance detective just been abducted.

587
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:58,193
So... Yeah. This is where it gets a little rushed the belong. Yeah. It... It definitely feels accelerated like there's a few panel missing moments here. I feel like we could've have had some inkling about the the faith Ruby earlier,

588
00:58:58,731 --> 00:59:09,912
which which, of course must be a little parity of the hope Diamond, I guess. Right? Faith and hope. Yeah. I was gonna say, it's another instance where the story feels a little generic and that it wasn't.

589
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:17,093
Least off serves from the newspaper strip so they don't seem to recognize Nikki a goofy in this one. Mh.

590
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,948
We talked of Nikki being there

591
00:59:20,406 --> 00:59:26,069
top three vlan detective, but he's not really coming off as that in this store no. It's just

592
00:59:26,486 --> 00:59:26,986
generic

593
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:31,868
version of Mickey here. Yeah they're just generic police officers.

594
00:59:32,404 --> 00:59:38,546
They see Goofy and think oh, it's that do this. Mh. Yeah. He might as well just be Donald.

595
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,210
Right? Like, he might as well this be one of Barks, every man versions

596
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:49,728
of of donald caught up in something. I do like the silly bit with Goofy empty

597
00:59:50,106 --> 00:59:53,400
his shoe. It feels very on character.

598
00:59:54,097 --> 01:00:02,715
I like I like that it gives you this as you say that head slapping moment. And and so we transition back to the house on

599
01:00:03,316 --> 01:00:03,816
Boulevard.

600
01:00:04,116 --> 01:00:10,830
We've got this very generic looking tough guy that is... That pee is bringing Mickey to

601
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:23,280
Pete doesn't recognize Mickey so they don't seem to have this history. He just says I caught dis fella a snoop around a place mister Who's. And as Mickey goes to explain, he hears

602
01:00:23,699 --> 01:00:26,836
many complaining, many mini insisting

603
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:29,624
she be let out. She's being held captive.

604
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:38,122
And he indicates that yes, I know her that's minnie mouse. This leads us to the guy wondering where the ring is, and

605
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:45,171
Mickey says, I I know it's right here in my pocket, a girl and a red hat gave it to me. And

606
01:00:45,711 --> 01:00:47,491
the the two tufts are

607
01:00:47,831 --> 01:00:54,862
distracted and delighted by seeing it is in fact to the ring of course, it's only gonna be the glass. Housing.

608
01:00:55,201 --> 01:01:23,549
Like you said... Like Debbie has said, this is starting to be where it's a little too generic you know, to be, you know, to get fully invested in, this is a great story of any kind. And but it does when they find out that the the ruby is gone. It does lead to probably the best bit of dialogue in this story, which is obviously Carl's Now you don't. Through this portal past the fastest mice in the world that's which is way

609
01:01:24,127 --> 01:01:30,027
way way way, way too clever. For any Mc mouse story published by Western.

610
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,738
So Yes. That is that is Carl's

611
01:01:33,434 --> 01:01:34,971
contribution to the mickey lexicon.

612
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:43,506
Yeah. Yeah. That... This upcoming page is like the stand out. Right? As as the mice are celebrating and

613
01:01:44,046 --> 01:01:50,166
the two tufts are discovering the ruby is gone. Mickey he get soft that great line that you mentioned.

614
01:01:50,846 --> 01:01:53,299
And then what happens that Oh, well,

615
01:01:54,098 --> 01:01:56,633
there's a quite a horrifying bit of

616
01:01:57,091 --> 01:01:58,948
violence with the door getting

617
01:01:59,406 --> 01:02:09,220
shattered to pieces by the Tommy Guns. Of Pete and who's it, and they jump... They jump... The mice jumped out the window and they try to hide and escape, but

618
01:02:09,917 --> 01:02:13,871
this is I I can't help with reading a little bit of a miso

619
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:19,411
bit to this story because it's many stupid hat that gives them away. Yeah.

620
01:02:20,186 --> 01:02:26,326
Know So it's all the woman's fault I cast. But that's that's sort of a reading on this and it's

621
01:02:26,946 --> 01:02:29,219
it's not the most particularly

622
01:02:29,557 --> 01:02:31,494
pleasant reading of it

623
01:02:31,911 --> 01:02:33,010
So so

624
01:02:33,428 --> 01:02:40,367
Yeah. I agree. Yeah. But but I do love the team gun. Yeah. We're the Tommy Fire.

625
01:02:41,024 --> 01:02:57,332
It's it's so... It's weird to say this, like Gun violence is terrible etcetera, etcetera, but I I do love to see gun play in my mouse comics. Right. Yeah. It's not Al mouse kinda without a It reminds me of what we had with with Floyd god.

626
01:02:57,671 --> 01:03:09,884
Mh. The bullets going through the door. Almost says something I have been old. Nineteen thirties gangster movie. Mh. Yeah. Definitely evo that sort of feel. I like the sound effects

627
01:03:11,156 --> 01:03:12,936
and, you know, it seems particularly

628
01:03:13,436 --> 01:03:21,627
unfair when when Nikki is gonna, like, glare at her hat giving them away. Because on the previous page,

629
01:03:22,045 --> 01:03:23,801
he... When he's reunited,

630
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,738
he... He's bragging

631
01:03:26,156 --> 01:03:28,391
I even returned your hat, you know? Like,

632
01:03:29,404 --> 01:03:33,537
So it seems it seems like a a weird little dig at

633
01:03:34,035 --> 01:03:37,888
again, Well, Mickey, it's your fault you brought it back. Right.

634
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:44,188
So that almost seems like a donald duck moment. Oh I get it it's that cat.

635
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:46,843
Yeah. That little Al of.

636
01:03:47,595 --> 01:03:49,930
Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right. So

637
01:03:50,307 --> 01:03:53,040
the the two mice are caught.

638
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:57,206
I like seeing key, you know, just holding them both by the neck.

639
01:03:58,258 --> 01:04:01,311
And who's is interrogating them about the Ruby?

640
01:04:01,888 --> 01:04:03,824
And Mickey is pretty

641
01:04:04,202 --> 01:04:22,751
truth full to the bad guys throughout this brief story. Says my friend Goofy got it. I'll get it for you if you let me go. And who's it says you know, he says, no, you've gotta bring the ruby and Al let you both go. But if you call the police, you'll never see her again. And and at that moment,

642
01:04:23,266 --> 01:04:33,617
goofy just very conveniently shows up in the open window behind them And and says, hey, Nikki. The police and and it kinda trails off.

643
01:04:34,114 --> 01:04:39,285
Do you wanna tell us about the sequence that? Yeah. This is this is definitely God

644
01:04:39,703 --> 01:04:43,848
influenced. There are shadows of this and the other stories where Goofy

645
01:04:44,226 --> 01:04:49,649
completely by accident will save the day without realizing it. And Mickey

646
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:52,522
being quick on his feet uses that as...

647
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,714
Now, it is the cop. So alright. Don't shoot officer

648
01:04:56,252 --> 01:04:58,245
Don't shoot up sergeant and

649
01:04:58,584 --> 01:05:08,183
he uses it so he gets... He gets to take their the villain guns away and tie them up. Because they can't see that just the local local goofy. And...

650
01:05:08,582 --> 01:05:09,082
It's...

651
01:05:09,619 --> 01:05:23,168
I mean, this is a silly story. So it's so... This is okay. I can... I can buy this a little bit of can try and here. Yeah. I can buy it too. It's it's one of those this is a common thing, right, A bluff sequence

652
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,578
The thing is, like, bluff,

653
01:05:25,957 --> 01:05:31,491
it just... It it... It's all dialogue based, so I like, it just doesn't carry over

654
01:05:31,925 --> 01:05:37,389
that well Inducks economic, it feels lot paced to me. I'm fine with prints.

655
01:05:38,147 --> 01:05:42,888
What it's Yeah. This this bluff goes on for half a page.

656
01:05:43,265 --> 01:06:10,846
You... Yeah. I would think if it was one of the golf percent strips it will be wrapped up a little tighter. Yeah. What do you think? Does it work for you, Debbie? Like I say, the whole story really has sort of a generic feel, but then you get these little bits in there that like that and you already said it feels like, oh wait, this is This does feel like a god moment And then you have this fantastic look on Nikki face as he's taking the gun.

657
01:06:11,319 --> 01:06:23,324
Yeah. Yeah. That is the most you're looking nikki. Yeah. Right. Yeah. The only time I can think of that is like, when he's supposed to be in under, like, mine controllers something Right. You're right. He looks...

658
01:06:23,743 --> 01:06:25,122
He he looks very

659
01:06:25,701 --> 01:06:37,251
like, he's b. It's it's a fun expression though. And then, you know, the the next page is the eleventh. This is like, Carl bonus page, I guess. Usually has ten badger

660
01:06:37,631 --> 01:06:44,101
of this length, but he's wrapping it up here. They're tying up the two bad guys Goofy is questioning

661
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:53,249
where's the police. I don't see no sergeant and He explains you are the police and sergeant and the the bad guy is predictably

662
01:06:53,626 --> 01:06:54,126
outraged.

663
01:06:54,955 --> 01:06:55,455
And

664
01:06:55,873 --> 01:06:57,171
goofy kind of

665
01:06:57,588 --> 01:07:12,595
unnecessarily wraps it up saying I'm just goofy. The police wouldn't listen to me. It feels like maybe a little more explanation than we need. Yeah. It almost feels like a drawback throwback to or I'm mickey mouse, and this is Goofy. Yes. It is.

666
01:07:13,254 --> 01:07:13,534
Alright.

667
01:07:14,932 --> 01:07:15,712
This guy.

668
01:07:16,091 --> 01:07:21,401
Yes. And and then the the story wraps up mostly in the police station

669
01:07:21,819 --> 01:07:23,039
where Mickey

670
01:07:23,378 --> 01:07:25,635
gets his, you know, just

671
01:07:26,294 --> 01:07:28,731
congratulations and apologies from the police.

672
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:30,326
And

673
01:07:30,626 --> 01:07:31,126
they

674
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:32,006
they

675
01:07:32,386 --> 01:07:34,546
try to figure out where the ruby is.

676
01:07:35,746 --> 01:07:38,006
Mickey says give us the ruby

677
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:46,934
goofy. And Debbie, what how does this play out when when he goes to get the the ruby? Oh in typical Goofy fashion,

678
01:07:48,266 --> 01:07:55,438
gone, I must to ship it out of my shit with the little stones that was hurting me and, of course, making like what?

679
01:07:55,777 --> 01:07:56,696
And then, of course,

680
01:07:57,269 --> 01:08:00,081
something that would only be a good that point

681
01:08:00,457 --> 01:08:02,711
It's carlin a soc. Mh

682
01:08:03,087 --> 01:08:03,587
packets.

683
01:08:04,123 --> 01:08:04,796
Yeah. Right

684
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:09,500
I I like that. It's it's a little... It's gross, but it's it's also

685
01:08:09,837 --> 01:08:36,145
completely in character. That... Once again, it's completely by accident that he didn't throw it away. It's it's saved by that disgusting sock that he's never gotten replaced. It's really cute look on his face one the Al and that's the closest it looks to a a with traditional goofy there. This happy look on his face. Yeah. I have the same thought. It feels like he's

686
01:08:36,684 --> 01:08:40,715
it feels like he's kind of gotten goofy right by the end of the store.

687
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:45,080
Just in time to never have to draw never again. Right?

688
01:08:46,357 --> 01:08:48,292
And and so he...

689
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:51,060
They returned the faith Ruby,

690
01:08:51,881 --> 01:09:02,787
the police officer allude to a big reward. And the story closes out with them walking past another hat shop with mini pondering buying another hat

691
01:09:03,406 --> 01:09:08,429
and he says, not another red one I hope And

692
01:09:08,806 --> 01:09:19,765
I'm not sure this is aged that well, but she says no indeed, I'll never buy another hat that you don't like mickey. Mh. And it is otherwise, a cute little closing

693
01:09:20,263 --> 01:09:25,720
silhouette of the two ice. So it looks very sweet. It's almost the head of our barrett and oh

694
01:09:26,096 --> 01:09:27,274
not another hat.

695
01:09:28,009 --> 01:09:28,129
Right.

696
01:09:28,845 --> 01:09:29,881
Right. Exactly.

697
01:09:30,296 --> 01:09:34,676
Yeah. So so you guys that was it. That was a brisk little

698
01:09:35,015 --> 01:09:38,536
eleven pager. There was obviously a lot to say about it.

699
01:09:39,468 --> 01:09:43,553
But what what are your what are your overall thoughts

700
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:47,194
about the story? I see it's a pleasant

701
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:49,984
yet, really not outstanding.

702
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,740
Story. I mean, it's it's a fun greasy want to read through, but it's

703
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:59,644
despite being included what called Mickey Mouse classics. It really isn't

704
01:10:00,339 --> 01:10:00,498
Right.

705
01:10:01,853 --> 01:10:02,411
Completion this.

706
01:10:03,186 --> 01:10:13,574
Right. It's it's as we've been saying, it's just a little too generic and you just can clearly tell Carl Barks as her was not in this.

707
01:10:14,151 --> 01:10:17,400
One thing as I was going through the story just now,

708
01:10:18,136 --> 01:10:24,553
he did not draw a single flash panel in this entire story. Other than the opening panel, they're... It's

709
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:31,200
it's strictly just, you know, it's the fort tier story. No, not no no change up whatsoever.

710
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:37,016
And I'm just call... I'm just reminded of what Carl said about that one ji

711
01:10:38,236 --> 01:10:52,126
piper story never finished is like, well, you're not gonna pay me what this is worth. So I'm just not gonna draw it. And this is... This seems to be it. I mean, there's... I mean, of course, Huey,. He's just too good did not draw something, but

712
01:10:52,904 --> 01:11:00,281
draw some interesting panels. But Right. You know, this is just going through the motions. It's he's just doing it. It's an assignment and

713
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:09,785
you can sorta of be grateful that Chase Craig and though the other guys never gave Carl another store... Mickey story to do because I mean this is perfectly passed

714
01:11:10,363 --> 01:11:12,754
and perfectly fine. But, you know,

715
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:44,980
you you wanted this guy because he wrote Donald Inducks cartoons that walt disney me approved. So keep them on that character. Yeah. I mean, we we know how it turned out. Right? And And I guess, like, I'm thinking I'm sitting here thinking we talked about, like, the what if. Right? What if he had kind of branch out and maybe done more I have no doubt he would have come up with some classic Mickey stories. Right. And I also have to think to myself, like, his very first

716
01:11:45,415 --> 01:11:47,513
plotted and written and drawn

717
01:11:47,892 --> 01:11:48,951
adventure was

718
01:11:49,290 --> 01:12:03,514
the mum ring. Mh. Right. Like, and and, like, it's not a perfect story. But for his first independent story, it has some real greatness to it. Mh. Like, I think it's an rat

719
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:12,367
worthwhile first effort. In a way that this just isn't. Yeah. The money ring has one of my all time favorite panels.

720
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:16,093
Where you see this terrified terrifying donald Inducks screaming

721
01:12:16,431 --> 01:12:20,820
the mum, the mum they're sitting up in their case is eating my family.

722
01:12:21,315 --> 01:12:30,535
Yeah. Yeah. That's a great one. I I'm I'm a big fan of that too. There's a lot to really like about the story. With the absurdity of they're eating my sandwich.

723
01:12:31,846 --> 01:12:38,447
Right. And his pal fear. But but... Yeah, he kinda hit the ground running with Donald

724
01:12:38,784 --> 01:12:48,010
in a way that he just he just didn't with Mickey and... Yeah. He he just clearly found something that was a character and a stable that was

725
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:57,995
more interesting to him than this, and it's also... Well, you he's probably think Carl Barks is probably thinking well, Floyd already perfect this why why should I

726
01:12:58,773 --> 01:12:59,273
try

727
01:12:59,771 --> 01:13:08,429
let let me try this other character that nobody else seems to get. Yeah. I find that totally believable. Right? Like, like, Mickey

728
01:13:08,807 --> 01:13:10,124
has been done.

729
01:13:10,643 --> 01:13:11,143
I

730
01:13:11,521 --> 01:13:40,035
I'm good at Donald. I will see what I can do with him. I'm sure you never, like, sat down and thought, I'm gonna be the duct man, but that's that's what happened. Yeah. I it would have been nice. To see his classic mickey story. I'm not gonna lie. Would have been... It would have been fun to see it. Like, if I could pick and choose, there's a couple of non classic that I might trade of the dock stories, but I would I wouldn't wanna risk, like, miss I'm one of his his true class.

731
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:43,542
I will note too that he

732
01:13:44,198 --> 01:13:45,974
participate in the ever

733
01:13:46,471 --> 01:13:49,245
ongoing eras of horace horse calls.

734
01:13:50,555 --> 01:14:03,933
Like, Cla without Horace, that that becomes the norm at some point, but I think it's a shame. Yeah. Won't even clear a belly didn't really kinda have her voice down when he wrote it. She just comes off sounding like some generic

735
01:14:04,803 --> 01:14:08,689
glitch with her dialogue if you looked at the god

736
01:14:09,026 --> 01:14:10,960
never quite rode her as

737
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:18,590
sounding like something out of the lavender the way Right. Router there. Yeah. And I... I like the dynamic.

738
01:14:18,968 --> 01:14:21,161
I like the Al and Horace.

739
01:14:21,656 --> 01:14:22,716
Stuff in those...

740
01:14:24,575 --> 01:14:28,095
The that reg rich stories is one of the best do. Yeah.

741
01:14:28,829 --> 01:14:29,648
Floyd did.

742
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:32,638
No. What's just say... It's it's a courier.

743
01:14:33,095 --> 01:14:35,150
It's jeff... It's definitely

744
01:14:35,687 --> 01:14:37,143
one of the better Carry

745
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:56,104
but, you know, it's... Yeah. I might have liked to seen what Barks would have done with Mickey when he was real... Like, he just went off the adventures... The Ducktales. And he just went off the duck adventure for one month and then a mickey But who knows it might have been just as, you know, detached as this. Right?

746
01:14:56,442 --> 01:15:03,376
And and he himself, I didn't type the quote, but I saw something where he he said he he couldn't do Mickey and donald.

747
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:06,887
Together for some reason, which of course god

748
01:15:07,227 --> 01:15:13,134
did do. Right. Not me... Donald was never that memorable in in the got. And the stories.

749
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:22,890
You guys I find it very interesting. I'm kind of gonna transition now into what the community thinks about this. I I always like to check on Inducks

750
01:15:23,528 --> 01:15:27,786
to see where the the rankings are. For Inducks.

751
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:30,597
And you guys... This is I think, Huey,

752
01:15:31,236 --> 01:15:31,594
unfair.

753
01:15:33,788 --> 01:15:42,675
This one has one of the very lowest ratings. Of any Barks story. It's a it's a seven point o on index.

754
01:15:43,052 --> 01:15:43,809
That eye.

755
01:15:45,284 --> 01:15:49,396
Well, like, there are so many stories with that ranking

756
01:15:49,776 --> 01:16:14,587
that it's more useful. It's more instructive to look at its like, or ring and it is not story nine thousand nine hundred and thirty eight as of, you know, today. Out of the forty three or so thousand stories. And and that's just so out of out of the range of his other just adequate stories that I I I can only assume that people are like,

757
01:16:15,105 --> 01:16:24,234
it's his mickey mouse story. I don't like his mickey mouse story. Like to me, this is a fine story. Is nothing special. But but it's not markedly

758
01:16:24,612 --> 01:16:30,990
worse than most of his, like, standard Ducktales page no. But but it's it it's

759
01:16:31,809 --> 01:16:34,107
the the words probably un remarkable.

760
01:16:34,526 --> 01:16:36,065
So that's probably,

761
01:16:36,524 --> 01:16:36,723
you know,

762
01:16:37,523 --> 01:16:42,272
that's probably the major factor. Right. Yeah. I think it's just kind of a footnote

763
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:44,190
really in that

764
01:16:44,529 --> 01:16:48,716
kinda like how we did one party p. One anti panda,

765
01:16:49,052 --> 01:16:54,614
one mickey mouse. It's just kind of something there that maybe completes slight seek out.

766
01:16:55,151 --> 01:17:03,208
Right. I agree. I just don't think there's any... It ranks below some of his pretty weak later Inducks stories, I think. So...

767
01:17:04,284 --> 01:17:14,778
So I just... I just don't think that's too fair. But but it it really is what it is. You know, it's a fine story. I would think it odd if it ranked below things like grandma Inducks

768
01:17:15,057 --> 01:17:17,288
farm friends. Oh, boy. Right.

769
01:17:18,777 --> 01:17:32,125
Well, least Karl wrote these, this one too. Yeah. Yeah. It's got some decently sharp writing. So Let's see. I... Yeah, I'd wanted to make sure that we touched on kind of the hypothetical the what if.

770
01:17:32,662 --> 01:17:43,124
And and it sounds like we're all in pretty much a agreement that we're glad he stuck with du. I think it's just he worked with Donald so long but the fields that he just

771
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:44,864
understood the characters. Yes.

772
01:17:45,944 --> 01:17:46,384
Exactly.

773
01:17:47,144 --> 01:17:52,304
Exactly the character in ways that even the people doing the films didn't think to do so.

774
01:17:52,718 --> 01:18:09,006
If far didn't think to expand donald from being just this little guy who uses is temper to sort of an every man and into a zone specific character. Right. Exactly. Yeah. That's well set. I think he he elevated him from

775
01:18:09,345 --> 01:18:16,048
from the films. For sure. So thank you guys very much for for joining me to, you know, do this

776
01:18:16,586 --> 01:18:19,201
