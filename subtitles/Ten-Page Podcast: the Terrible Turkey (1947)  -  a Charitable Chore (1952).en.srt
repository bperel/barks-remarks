00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:09,384
We have

00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:32,405
Hello, and welcome to Barks Remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comics of all time. This episode is a ten page podcast, all about one of his short stories. Get ready to enjoy our remarks.

3
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:39,053
Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever a Grown man who enjoys Inducks comics,

4
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:43,925
and I'm joined by a new guest, and we're gonna be talking about a couple of

5
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,245
giving themed stories.

6
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:59,450
But first, I'd like to introduce my guess David. If you... If you can introduce yourself, please and mention kinda your your background as box fan. So, yeah, my name is David Wi. I live in Connecticut.

7
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:00,965
With my family.

8
00:01:02,184 --> 00:01:02,684
I

9
00:01:03,145 --> 00:01:08,165
have known about Carl Barks comics since literally before I can remember my father

10
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:10,653
grew up reading them

11
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,407
and he would raise

12
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,884
when I was a kid about how great these comics for and would reach us before I could even read.

13
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:26,817
And there was a a real robot experience with him was to, you know, kinda snuggle it with him and and read read the comments. And I remember the...

14
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:33,050
When I was first wanted to read in elementary school, one of the things I was really excited about was to be able to read the comm by myself.

15
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:41,344
And... But the Barks is very much a part of my use in in terms of the humor the the references to various.

16
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:42,939
Storylines lines

17
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,479
remarks often, you know,

18
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,199
donald or Scrooge

19
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,659
biting sarcastic with

20
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:50,979
would come in

21
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:51,834
to

22
00:01:52,174 --> 00:02:02,280
regular conversation and our family. So I definitely was was raised in a very Barks household That's awesome. I I wish I'd had the experience of getting to

23
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:03,158
enjoy

24
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:09,202
the comics like, with other people, but but I I kinda discovered them on my own.

25
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,730
But But I know through doing the podcast, a lot of people have had that really nice experience of getting to

26
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:22,049
read them with their parents, you know, their parents sharing them and learning to read from them. And

27
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,977
I have course have been leading them to my own kids.

28
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:32,059
Do you do you have kids data? I think you mentioned having? Yeah. I have four four kids, my youngest

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,339
daughter is...

30
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:37,219
I... I've gotten into Barks. She really really enjoys it. The others

31
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:43,059
I might have shown them Al once once in a while, and they they kinda never really never really click with them

32
00:02:43,596 --> 00:03:03,437
but she she loves them. And so she we read them together and And when my my father also will read with her sometimes too. And it's it's it's a lot of fun. So Vaccine have absolutely. Yeah. That that family connection is is great. You know, it's one of the things I really love And and, of course, here here's a nice smooth safe.

33
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:05,375
Speaking of families

34
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:07,709
how how is

35
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:12,169
Giving your household, David? Do you guys thanksgiving you important to you guys?

36
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:15,716
Yeah. I think like, a lot of people we try to get together with family

37
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:21,977
Al little different every year, which which family we're with and and who who were able to be together with. But

38
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:25,140
Yeah. That's definitely an important thing. It's Yeah.

39
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:27,093
Absolutely.

40
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:42,739
It is a good one. And growing up, you know, is a big deal in my household. I'm so far away from family now. Unfortunately, I don't get to have the big thanksgiving. But but it's it's always nice having like these seasonal connect with the economics. You know, Barks.

41
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:51,801
Barks had a great hook. Of course, you get you gotta assume that Wes publishing and an publisher and editor naturally is encouraging

42
00:03:52,178 --> 00:04:08,219
artist to do seasonal tie. So if you look at the list of Barks electronics. He had just like a a ton of Christmas ones and a handful of them for other holidays. But the thanksgiving was pretty reliable. You got to put out. Five ten pager

43
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:09,672
connection to the holiday.

44
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:12,859
And we're we're covering two of them, David,

45
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:13,877
and

46
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:20,682
I let you pick them. So do you wanna tell us... I mean, we kinda... We kinda collaborated. But

47
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:28,399
but you wanna mention the two titles that we're gonna be talking about? Yeah. So the first one we'll be talking about is

48
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:32,365
the terrible turkey, which is number eighty seven.

49
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:37,788
And stories. And and the and the other one is a charitable shore, which is

50
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:38,985
my favorite

51
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:40,222
Thanksgiving

52
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:43,232
story and honestly, probably my

53
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,948
top twenty, it's not top ten

54
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,635
stories of all time. My personal. My personal list. So.

55
00:04:50,250 --> 00:05:03,724
We'll get to that too. Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm excited to talk about that and so I I guess. That a charitable chores is gonna be kinda like the main course Right? And the terrible turkey will be kinda like one of our things giving appetizers.

56
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,479
Sure. That sounds good. So you mentioned there they're both walt Disney comics

57
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,580
publications. I think I think title was just call Walters these comics at that point.

58
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:22,725
Appearing in eighty seven. The terrible cherokee was was a fairly early one December of nineteen forty seven is the cover date.

59
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,039
We we Al the podcast

60
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:28,020
already covered last year.

61
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:37,275
Listeners if you're... If you really like one of the stories called turkey trouble. We covered the early one that goes by that title.

62
00:05:37,995 --> 00:05:53,181
And then the the remaining two stories that will we'll save for next year our the custard gun and another a second one that's also called Turkey trouble. One of a very few instances, I think where they doubled up on the title.

63
00:05:54,258 --> 00:06:01,989
You know, he Barks didn't really pick his own titles. A lot of these titles were just kicked over over the years by other editors.

64
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:09,461
Where were those titles were they on the the cover of the comics or where were some of them will have had

65
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:10,499
titles

66
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:13,315
above the first panel.

67
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:18,079
Right. In in some cases, but but more often than not, they're just un title.

68
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:22,510
And so, you know, different publishers have given them different titles,

69
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:40,894
right throughout the years. And at some point, I don't know how they made it official. But, like, they all have their own... I think I think it was done for the for the publication of the Carl Barks library is when they really went ahead and just kinda made certain titles canon. Yeah. So I I like you, I think

70
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:45,335
I think the charitable chores is gonna be a little bit more interesting to talk about.

71
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:50,251
But there's definitely a lot to like about the terrible turkey.

72
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:51,786
So So. I'm,

73
00:06:52,521 --> 00:07:11,372
you know, this this is one of our episodes that I call the ten page podcast, and and it's a little bit more lightly research. So what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna mention the rate... The ranking that you see Inducks right now for this one. So this one is

74
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:20,499
loaded on by the community on the side index. It's got a seven point two. And that is good for a rank of eight hundred and fourteen

75
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,659
out of all like, forty two thousand

76
00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:39,462
titles, disney comics stories that are ranked on the side. So, David as far as where that plays is it? It's a pretty well ranked Barks story. It's certainly not like one of the highly ranked, ten pages. I being a total

77
00:07:40,200 --> 00:08:12,642
obsessive nerd. I went in and and put all the stories into a spreadsheet so I could kinda find, like, the midway point and get a good good median ranking. It turns out that the median ranking for the stories is seven point two two. Right. So So that's where this one Barks by the community. I think of it is is pretty much an average Barks sure. So let's let's do it. We're gonna launch in, and and we're gonna go ahead and just kinda summarize this story page by page and and offer up some commentary in between.

78
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:15,619
Alright. So the terrible Turkey

79
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:18,715
starts out. This this is a pretty good setup up.

80
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,150
We see Donald at at a Butcher

81
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,150
shop, and he is

82
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,590
he's arguing with the butcher

83
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:30,645
insisting that he wouldn't pay as much...

84
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:37,819
The the man wants to charge from seventy cents of pound for Turkey, which Donald says he wouldn't pay that much for diamonds.

85
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:45,394
It's a it's a pretty pretty good bit of donald. Spout off. And he heads on home encountering the nephews,

86
00:08:46,255 --> 00:09:02,078
and he's basically thinking about another way that he can get himself at Turkey. And as he slams his way into his house, the nephews mu over what what he's gonna do maybe he expects to win a turkey and a raffle.

87
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:04,652
Kinda wonder if that's almost like,

88
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:06,629
Barks.

89
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:07,787
Bark is gonna

90
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:14,884
go with that idea a couple of times. So I wonder if you know that in the back his mind. Right. Right. Is with Thanksgiving,

91
00:09:15,283 --> 00:09:20,028
specifically that thing Al those Thanksgiving Turkey. Yeah. Yeah. And I guess,

92
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:33,890
I guess that he already got to use the idea of the Turkey, because he nickname that raffle and the the turkey trouble would have been the first one. So so, yeah, maybe he was thinking of that. I guess it would have been just one year before.

93
00:09:34,664 --> 00:09:36,562
And, David, we get this really

94
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:37,921
kind of fun

95
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,000
silly

96
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:40,119
dated

97
00:09:40,698 --> 00:09:55,340
image of don on loading an old, like, is this is this a blender bus? What kind of gun is this? It's like... I think it's... Yeah. It's it's the kind of thing you you would see in pictures of the programs. I I don't know what error that stop. They stop using that type of...

98
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:57,095
Right. You,

99
00:09:57,593 --> 00:10:04,020
but it's... Yeah. I mean, it's it's definitely and you'd seeing the in the the drawings of the the power the pull.

100
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,460
It's not that

101
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,340
displayed

102
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:23,480
that's blade that played shaft and Yeah. And he's, like actually pouring gun fl gun powder and using the flint and it's got a flint lock. So he's kind of... We get... We get this case that he's... He's got it in his head that he's gonna get his

103
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:25,473
meal the way that the

104
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:28,805
might have. Any any thoughts on this

105
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:35,855
intro here david? It's it's a nice... It's a nice setup up. I I like it, and it it's it it's, you know, very typical of donald.

106
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:44,935
Something gets him really keyed off, and then he has an emotionally exaggerating in response to it. You know, he has a remark in the second panel.

107
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:53,547
One don't butcher carry a black and be done with it is if, you know, charging this much for turkey is equivalent to, you know, beating someone up and robbing.

108
00:10:55,082 --> 00:11:01,405
And in in in typical bible fashion, and he wants to, you know, have some wacky idea that he's gonna gonna, you know,

109
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:04,465
find a way around this problem.

110
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:08,725
And and he's diving right into and he he's gonna make it happen.

111
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:11,557
Okay Right. Yeah. I I like this.

112
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:20,314
The the nephews are kind of a non entity so far. This is kind of typical of the plate forties where they're just... They're a little bit background

113
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:22,954
in favor of of Donald

114
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,809
anger. Yep. That guy had tell us about the next page. So let's see.

115
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:29,566
He comes out of the house

116
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:33,740
dressed as a as a... Basically, you know, as as he said, like a like a program,

117
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:43,919
in the same outfit with those... Who do you call that a stove quite hat or or or I'm not sure what what that would probably called it a pi hat, but program add and I'm sure there's is proper

118
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:50,393
it's basically what we saw in the stored books and when we learned about Thanksgiving in in elementary school. And, of course,

119
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:52,710
the kids think this is hilarious

120
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:56,881
No and they're just enjoying it. Probably just as much as the reader is.

121
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:05,409
Donald is, of course, too serious to realize the absurdity of it all and he's he's he's in... He's living in the moment. He's he's gonna be a program, and he

122
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:06,709
thinks he's got the stuff.

123
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:08,129
Right. And

124
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:12,500
they continue to laugh and he he branches off into the into the

125
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,015
forest prime as Barks sprite it. I I love Barks a little

126
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:22,730
you know, descriptions he has in in the corner boxes that often Very very clever

127
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:43,840
writing. And... Right. Instead of just saying in the forest during the, you know, it's the four four needle. And and to me, it's especially funny because you can, like, see a house in the back around. So it's it's yeah it's dead start. It's like... It's it's like a visual verbal punch line. It's that kind thing you can only get in the comics.

128
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:54,698
Sure. Sure. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. You get you get a little bit of Donald anger there and, you know, including his teeth and everything and he's completely immune to their ridicule I mean, he he isn't even...

129
00:12:55,157 --> 00:13:13,344
He's not even feeling it, which later on, he does. But at this point, he doesn't care about being last at because he's he's two series frame and he's gonna show that. He is fueled by his determination. Yeah. As you say, this is our idea of how Pilgrims dressed. This is very like, grade school Thanksgiving Yep. Agents

130
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:14,819
and and

131
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:17,252
I don't think the pilgrims really

132
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:29,976
hunted cherokee like this. I know famously, like, the the revision mistake is that they probably didn't even have turkey at the first Thanksgiving. But but this is Donald childish understanding of it. Yes.

133
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:33,483
So on the next page, we've got the Nephews

134
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:43,845
getting bored waiting around, you know, they kinda resolved that they wanna see the act and and they decide very quickly that they wanna go in the woods and place some tricks on on Mcdonald.

135
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:52,443
We've got a really neat little time capsule of kids in the late forties, David. We we see them playing with their pocket I basically.

136
00:13:53,961 --> 00:14:04,625
Is that mum peg? Is that the name of that? Came. I think it may be... If I'm correct, it was this game kids in the fifties played where they they basically take your, you know, your army ish or whatever

137
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:15,684
open whatever you call an knife the pocket knife, and you could flip it around in the air and try to yeah. Around behind. Like it I don't know how get. But but it's said it was a game they played back. You know

138
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,475
you know? Yeah. I'm I'm so glad I've got

139
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:26,109
guest on who knows this stuff because I I would have lost right over that, but I I opened up another tab and sure enough mum.

140
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:32,149
Yeah. No. People can look that up and find out about the knife cams the kids played when they didn't have

141
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:32,889
tablets.

142
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:35,604
Yes. We're also very much

143
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:43,655
comment on, you know, how things have changed whereas if you saw it kids playing with knives these days that I think the you'd be calling the police and there'd be a whole thing.

144
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:47,027
Right Right. So think things just kids. Yes. Yeah.

145
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:58,634
And so we we transitioned to that is gonna be a pretty predictable sequence. Right? We've got we've got the nephews basically stationed in in different spots in the forest.

146
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:11,587
Implementation a turkey and getting mcdonald's to run off after it. I I like that they they kinda kick it up and notch and they get clever about it by the end of this page where they use Al little

147
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:13,222
wheel device

148
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,337
to make Turkey tracks.

149
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:20,345
To find. A very visual page. You know, this feels kinda like the cartoons.

150
00:15:20,804 --> 00:15:34,736
Sure. Yeah. It it kinda sets it up. It's the beginning of them playing plain tricks on him. You know, in the previous page, they had been just used by it. And now at this point, they they're they're born playing their their knife game somehow they're just gonna have funded at mcdonald's expense. And

151
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:36,709
they did do it in typical,

152
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:38,749
you know, a clever fashion just

153
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:41,809
making and run back and forth having fun with them.

154
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:44,444
So in the following page

155
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:49,946
you, he's he's following the the tracks and the tracks go into a hole, which, of course,

156
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:57,203
you know, this displays mcdonald's ignorance of turkey and how they live because they don't live in holes like offers.

157
00:15:57,922 --> 00:15:58,621
But he's,

158
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,120
you know,

159
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:00,634
so much.

160
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:04,868
I guess he doesn't realize that this has to be some kind of trick at this point. He hasn't quite figured.

161
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:07,365
Thanks do pretty good job.

162
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:14,313
They do a pretty good job of railing him in here. Right? Because... Yeah. He briefly considers it's impossible.

163
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:24,379
Yeah Then what do they do? They have a little have a hose hook through the other end of the hole, where they say Got gobble. So now he the gobble from the hole and things

164
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:26,975
my goodness, there is a turkey in there.

165
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:33,281
Right. So, of course, he's... He starts taking, like like crazy as if he's, you know, digging to the center of the earth. And

166
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:39,768
throws up a heat dirt trying to find that turkey. I really like that gag. I think that... That's pretty clever. It's pretty funny.

167
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:42,596
And on to the next page,

168
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,907
you know, he's exhausted, but then he sees

169
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:49,673
a fan of turkey feathers behind the a log,

170
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:52,307
But it turns out to just be

171
00:16:52,845 --> 00:17:08,414
another gag. And at this point, he realizes he sees the kids footprints. Yep. So he clocks what they're doing. We do get a a little moment where he uses the the the very outdated term. We... We wouldn't say He says that he's been ji,

172
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:13,934
which is, you know, something that we we don't say anymore but would have been...

173
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:16,028
You see it. Just constantly

174
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:17,962
in these economics. Mh.

175
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:19,539
And

176
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:23,663
you know, he he strides off. In

177
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,523
fit of range, basically. Right. Yeah. That's that's true. And that was definitely

178
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:29,896
word that, you know,

179
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:38,489
we heard a lot back way back when, and then now it's not not used anymore because it's the nature So he storms off

180
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:40,943
and in the following page,

181
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:42,301
he

182
00:17:42,840 --> 00:18:02,954
stole he sees and what he's gonna do because he's furious with the kids and he runs in a real turkey, which, of course, he is another one of the kids gag. And and this is an old trope if I'm not mistaken and the idea of someone being fooled and then they see the real thing. I believe in I'm I'm mistaken in in Christmas on Barks mountain. Wasn't there a similar thing where they think it's a oh yeah the there.

183
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:22,839
The Barks, but I think it's Scrooge screws crust is a bit it's one of those things that it turns out. The real beer, and, you know, it's a similar type of... Yeah. But like like you say, this is an age old trope and you could probably count a couple dozen of Barks. Right. And Barks and and else elsewhere a literature as well. I mean, right. So he he storms past the actual Turkey that would actually

184
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:36,557
make a very delicious thanksgiving meal. I'm not really realizing what's going on. And then the kids come out of hiding. They see that Turkey and go wow real turkey and they try to rest to the ground, and basically, the turkey beats the stuffing out of the kids.

185
00:18:37,354 --> 00:18:39,865
Chases them away because it's a pretty tough turkey.

186
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:44,307
And so it... They're they're running for the hills in the turkey chase and after them. Yeah.

187
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:50,010
As you say, it's it's all pretty predictable stuff. These are tropes that we've seen a lot.

188
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:54,359
I will note that I really like Barks is like, actual

189
00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:55,918
illustration of the Turkey.

190
00:18:56,336 --> 00:19:00,205
It's it's a very well drawn bird. It really is. That's a really...

191
00:19:00,623 --> 00:19:03,117
Yeah. I I I imagine he had some

192
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:05,551
magazine article or some sort of

193
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:07,922
some book had a nice

194
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:19,775
photograph for something of a turkey that he putting through from. And as I know he he used to do that a lot with some of his with many of his drawings. He would draw from something that he they had. Right. And so on the next page,

195
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,084
you know, we get that kind of

196
00:19:22,903 --> 00:19:25,361
Donald direct reconcile that I'm seen...

197
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,654
He he realizes that indeed. This is a real turkey as he sees it chasing the kids.

198
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:33,201
And and they narrow

199
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:34,595
escaped him by

200
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:45,865
jumping Creek and he gets lost and He loses the turkey and a thick. And so he resorts to using that fan of feathers to lure him out and tries to sound

201
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:54,314
like a Love turkey. Yeah. Exactly. And everything here, David is it's it is admittedly a a pretty

202
00:19:54,812 --> 00:19:55,312
conventional

203
00:19:55,731 --> 00:19:58,468
predictable story at this. Yeah. And then...

204
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:05,834
Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. I I agree with that. And unfortunately, for him and in the following falling page, the kids

205
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:07,072
see that

206
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:09,604
he the feathers that he's pretending

207
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:13,279
turkey, and they they fire their own arrows at him.

208
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:15,716
So it's interesting the way, and and he gets...

209
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:16,835
He he gets

210
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,869
struck in the rum with the those three arrows. I guess they're very accurate.

211
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:26,049
Might they're both interest. Which I think they can construct on their own and you can see that They

212
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:27,584
that very quickly.

213
00:20:28,884 --> 00:20:38,636
And it it it's great. I mean, look, the the kids play fritz and donald and donald gets made a full of and then donald trade placed tricks in the kids in. Donald gets made of full locksmith right.

214
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:39,754
It's

215
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:42,867
this isn't one of those back and forth things, which

216
00:20:43,564 --> 00:20:48,130
when you have those the those comments where they're some of the stories where they're going at it.

217
00:20:48,809 --> 00:21:00,209
Sometimes the kids end up and losing end and sometimes mcdonald's ends up and losing them and they go back and forth. This is one where just donald on the louisiana end, and that's that's it. The story. Yeah. Barks generally knows that that's what the readers like to see.

218
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:02,884
Yeah he he chases them away and

219
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:13,408
and then goes back to we're trying to find a an actual Turkey because he he knows the turkey there. So he's gonna wait till the like the time to find out turkey. Yeah. And and so

220
00:21:13,787 --> 00:21:16,445
we transition to the nighttime,

221
00:21:16,784 --> 00:21:17,284
and

222
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:24,805
we see a big fat rust bird, and Donald is really excited seeing that that there is his cherokee.

223
00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:35,299
And and any reader who with a little bit of experience basically knows what's coming because at no point, this is all drawn silhouette like Barks likes to do Al night.

224
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:39,050
There there's some good fun drawings, but

225
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,283
Donald catches the bird

226
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,838
and he takes

227
00:21:43,255 --> 00:21:51,067
him to a poultry cleaning plan which the sign notes conveniently is open all night. What all night.

228
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:56,491
There you go. And and Donald does that thing that suspend

229
00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:00,413
suspend belief a little bit where

230
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,602
the suspension of disbelief where he

231
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:05,117
tells the

232
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:06,689
cleaner

233
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:09,989
to dress his bird without looking at it.

234
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:17,004
And and the the man looks in and he says just a minute. Do you want this bird cleans to eat?

235
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:22,004
And Donald doesn't bother. He says, of course, get busy on him and stop acting foolish.

236
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:22,499
Yeah.

237
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:29,039
Getting the point of the silhouette, and Barks, of course, has wonderful use of syllables. So that's sun brock

238
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:37,695
fantastic And and Jeffrey Bloom wrote. We're a whole article on that and one of the glad stuff traditions that stuff where he talks about that.

239
00:22:38,109 --> 00:23:04,720
Mh And and here it's used not just statistically, but to further the story because you you see that that... What donald think is turkey as a silhouette and you're not really sure look... Has vaguely the shape cherokee and Right. And and, of course, that that's the whole point. I mean, you're seeing a so silhouette. You don't know what it is and donald does know it either. Just says, you know. It's definitely the right size too. Yeah. To... In mcdonald's defense. Yeah. So Donald serves this... What do he think is in Turkey.

240
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:10,468
To the kids. And it looks great. They're all excited about it, and then he takes his big knife

241
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,305
and it breaks

242
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:16,046
trying to cut the turkey and the Turkey and he said Al little too tough.

243
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:31,009
And then he tries another nice, and that life just starts to break apart and then you tries I saw and finally meet grinder and nothing than this turkey that what he thinks in turkey is too tough to. Nothing will touch. So

244
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:38,401
he calls the butcher and says, you know, what gives what's going on. He's really curious and the butcher is very much him used by it, and then

245
00:23:39,074 --> 00:23:53,127
tells him, you know knows, exactly what's going on, because it it wasn't turkey. He says, he just wasn't a Turkey brother. He was in Eagle. And Donald is in belief about that, and he pretty he got thinking was mistaken about the the that you've kidnapped. And the final the final

246
00:23:53,505 --> 00:23:54,483
panel is

247
00:23:55,419 --> 00:24:11,143
scrolling into a yield old dining car to together a turkey dinner. Two dollars and fifty cents of plate dessert extra. And the kids seem quite excited about it and they're there with Al little little adorable little hats on it. Donald was kicked off, but resigned to what's happening. And he's guys his hands baldwin up and shifts, but he, you know,

248
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,317
resigned to what they're gonna have to

249
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:15,210
that's what they have for Thanksgiving.

250
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:25,850
Right. And I nice gag at the end and that he, you know, got an eagle not knowing what it was. Yeah. Yeah. This it is a nice closer. It's a good gag.

251
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,902
And and I believe

252
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:32,584
according to memory, that is about the way that

253
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:35,464
that that his first

254
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:36,424
thanksgiving

255
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:42,199
story concluded with them, you know, heading to to get a Turkey dinner at

256
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:43,679
at some restaurant.

257
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:50,054
And and I will note you and I were talking. I was texting with you earlier that I realized reading

258
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:53,185
my... Because you referred to this as the eagle story.

259
00:24:54,541 --> 00:25:03,282
And and and reading this in my reprint I realized something that it always bothered me about this was that it's... It was actually

260
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:04,441
corrected

261
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,294
It it was actually edited

262
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:12,374
to something that seems to have been for, like, reader sensibilities.

263
00:25:12,835 --> 00:25:13,475
I'm guessing.

264
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:16,143
But really steps on that punch line

265
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:39,384
and and the one that I read says he wasn't... He just wasn't a turkey bidder. He was a giant quail. And and like, well that's a weird thing to edit it to. First of all. This I'm cute... Yeah. Curious what edition was that when was that published the one that you was it just a reprint of a... Yeah. So this was the reprint that was done by Disney Comics

266
00:25:39,964 --> 00:25:47,955
themselves Barks Disney themselves had the license. Okay. I think it was five seventy nine while disney comics and stories.

267
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:51,543
And and it's otherwise, like, very faithful.

268
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:56,651
Including... I forgot to mention. I... The... There were three pages

269
00:25:57,204 --> 00:25:59,141
that had art drawn by,

270
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,930
like, replaced arts for this. One. If you check and in the

271
00:26:04,468 --> 00:26:06,046
the guide book link

272
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:17,074
they know that pages is three, five and six were reg withdrawn, but that apparently, the original version was finally printed by the Dutch publisher or Over braun,

273
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:20,734
which which I think goes... I think that's who goes by Ag now.

274
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:25,009
Or maybe that's Food and burrows. But anyway, the Dutch

275
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:28,349
found, I guess, they found the original version.

276
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:36,244
So, yeah, if you look at some of those stories in some of the earlier printing or some of those pages they look they'll definitely look a little bit off.

277
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:40,586
Anyway with within this story, some of these pages they were they were

278
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:45,011
not drawn by Barks or... I I guess I don't understand what you're yeah

279
00:26:45,643 --> 00:27:11,244
Yeah. Oh, emma and I'm not I'm not saying it with with total confidence. But if you look at... What which which one do you have Right right there. I I have the the glad. This is it's five stories and, you know, this is so yeah. They they call out. The all they say is that pages is three, five and six or reg withdrawn, and I think that it is referring to the original printing.

280
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:26,909
So I'll just note that there's there's is at least that comment that in some printing, of. Some of the pages were red withdrawn for whatever reason. Yeah. It's interesting what you're saying about the eagles versus Giant. You said Giant Pheasant? Is that what I quail.

281
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:28,539
Giant Whale. I mean,

282
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:50,409
the the eagle... It... I remember reading this as a kid and think that's a little bit far fetched to really eagles... Are they that much tougher than turkeys and but whatever, I mean, really gonna look past that that absurdity for the purposes of the story and and we kinda think the eagles is being, you know, tough and majestic and a way the Turkey are not. Well it's a bird of praise, so I've gotta imagine if

283
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:59,678
it makes sense at least. To me that it in a sense. Yeah. Yeah. So... But a giant quail actually was pretty appetizing.

284
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,057
Like it does

285
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:23,790
are our game Barks. So... Yeah. I mean it's interesting when they make it. It's like that. I I I would... If I were added there, I would probably restricted it to the things that I thought were, you know, just beyond the pale, if there was something in there that was just outrageous that that should be printed, you know, then maybe remove that. And even that I would personally hesitate on because I I know with my kids. I I... When I read something

286
00:28:24,406 --> 00:28:28,572
older, and it's sometimes this happens in Barks stories whether there's something that is by our sensibilities.

287
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:29,743
Just

288
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:39,009
offensive. I'll point that out to my daughter and say, you know, this is a problem, and, you know, we need to understand, you know, Barks is writing in a different time with different types of

289
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:44,249
thinking, and this wasn't something he was, you know, people really thought about. Al much fact.

290
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:58,362
And and I would probably left it in. It... It's a weird thing to do because I'm who... There would... That many people find that offensive and even, you know, all I can think of, you know, I mentioned this to you and tax I I gotta assume that it's like a weird h

291
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:18,649
thing. Right? Like the eagle is is the national bird. Yep. Yes. To bald eagle. Sure. Maybe... I think it was even considered and endangered at that time. Right. So you know what? As I say it, that that that kinda of lines up in nineteen ninety one, I think it was considered endangered. So they might. They may have thought that that would

292
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:24,494
be a little more offensive for that But it's kinda funny because, like, famously, there was that original

293
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,575
this is one of those facts that people love to mention about the founding fathers.

294
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:32,067
Did you know that Ben Franklin... Yes.

295
00:29:33,226 --> 00:29:55,780
For the for the turkey to be the next the national bird. So so it's kinda funny there that we have an instance the first instance I know of about the punch line being accidentally eating Al eagle. Right. Right. So so, David, this is a fun one. I don't really have too much to say about this because I think like you and like, the community

296
00:29:56,134 --> 00:30:06,472
that this strikes me as a pretty average Barks story, you know, better than a story from your typical creator, but just just a fine example of a good enjoyable

297
00:30:07,288 --> 00:30:16,741
Barks ten pager. Yeah. I agree. It's it's a fun one. It's not definitely one that I would, you know, wanna re reread, but it's it's a it's a decent Barks story.

298
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:24,589
It's it's it's one I remember from growing up reading the story. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I remember with some fond.

299
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:29,869
But I know you're excited to talk about one of your personal favorites

300
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:37,168
and I I think while I don't consider it, like a favorite, it is it is more interesting.

301
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:42,226
By far. And there's a lot more to talk about in a charitable

302
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:42,962
chore.

303
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:45,653
So I will mention

304
00:30:46,363 --> 00:30:53,380
that. So as as you'd had mentioned, David, terrible C was published in walt disney disease Comments one forty seven.

305
00:30:53,938 --> 00:30:54,956
This one

306
00:30:55,627 --> 00:31:09,306
Oh and and that's five years later, in December of nineteen fifty two. Yep. Of course, that that would be the cover date. This would have come out, like properly in time for Thanksgiving because of the way that cover dates

307
00:31:10,004 --> 00:31:12,160
the the release lags the cover dates. Sure.

308
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,296
This one has

309
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:15,389
basically

310
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:16,869
an identical

311
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:22,309
rating to the terrible turkey. It's it's also got a seven point two

312
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:26,231
and it is ranked eight hundred and eleven

313
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:27,426
out of those

314
00:31:27,882 --> 00:31:32,223
forty two thousand stories. And just a reminder, that's three

315
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:43,291
better than terrible turkey. So this is basically a tie it's interesting that both thanksgiving stories are kinda groups there. But I think you're probably right

316
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,968
in in liking this one better,

317
00:31:46,307 --> 00:31:48,125
and we can kinda go into why.

318
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:54,684
After the story. I will I will just know before we read it, that I read this in an interesting

319
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:55,921
publication

320
00:31:56,274 --> 00:32:01,134
Disney comics put it out in a quarterly release that they call autumn Adventures.

321
00:32:01,594 --> 00:32:09,593
Oh little title. Yeah. No. I I remember this one for growing up. I'll I'll just say that. This was definitely definitely one. There's there's a...

322
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:16,818
Is a is a a few memorable lines in it that I, you know, are burned into into my brain from having her many times

323
00:32:17,197 --> 00:32:18,975
references to and my use

324
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:21,749
Yeah. It's it's a great. Great dialogue.

325
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:26,049
This does... It it stands out for for a few reasons. First off,

326
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:31,195
and and we we get this pretty early in the story. This is like Inducks family

327
00:32:31,773 --> 00:32:35,685
one where we've got his girlfriend Daisy and we've got cousin Gladstone.

328
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:41,859
Is gonna join the mix. Very memo, I would say, also, as we launch into the story,

329
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:45,734
we we have kind of an atypical donald. We have like this

330
00:32:46,392 --> 00:32:46,892
striving,

331
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:49,644
aspiring, Donald, who

332
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,313
is thinking to himself when when he sees daisy

333
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,706
club sign that says

334
00:32:56,059 --> 00:33:00,689
give some poor hungry deserving person a thanksgiving dinner in your home.

335
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:02,245
Sign up inside,

336
00:33:03,043 --> 00:33:08,874
You know, Donald is thinking himself what a noble idea. And and we get the impression that he really...

337
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:18,155
He he verbal is that he's got a little bit for Thanksgiving. Yep. Money this Thanksgiving, so he's eager to do a good deed. This is kind of Al a typical,

338
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:19,530
you know, donald.

339
00:33:20,104 --> 00:33:26,048
Yeah. I'm curious if there are other stories in which he's genuinely trying to do something charitable for the right reason.

340
00:33:26,687 --> 00:33:38,970
I mean, I guess there's certainly Christmas stories where that's that's sort of a theme yeah. Of the whole story. But this is interesting. It really focuses right from the beginning. It's all about donald trying to do this do something nice, you know?

341
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:46,806
Yeah. I think there must be a few, but it's definitely not typical. Barks needs Donald to be more

342
00:33:48,474 --> 00:33:54,052
full of goodwill more than than normal for the inevitable, like, def fl. Yes. So... Absolutely.

343
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:55,884
So Donald,

344
00:33:56,544 --> 00:33:59,764
Donald goes ahead and he follows Daisy directions

345
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,504
drawing a name from the box.

346
00:34:01,984 --> 00:34:09,175
Oh, and and just like the previous story. He some of the the downfall comes because he doesn't

347
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:13,011
go to the trouble to look. Yeah. That way what it is.

348
00:34:14,204 --> 00:34:14,704
And

349
00:34:15,525 --> 00:34:16,025
Daisy

350
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:18,905
prepares to leave

351
00:34:19,484 --> 00:34:23,304
as she directs him to the secretary to complete the arrangements.

352
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,800
And and he

353
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:30,760
he gives his details or he gets ready to give his details to the

354
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:32,892
kinda dump looking

355
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,029
secretary. Yeah.

356
00:34:35,665 --> 00:34:44,406
Sometimes Barks does these, like dump looking women, but I don't get the impression he's like making fun of her in this one or anything. She's just... No. He's just a warm. Very majorly.

357
00:34:45,264 --> 00:35:13,196
It's interesting to me David that we've got this, like, lady's club And and these exist still, but they were... I think I think this was such an important thing in in the fifties. This... I believe you're right. Yeah. A big part of civic involvement. Yeah. What do you think Scrooge opening? Yeah. It's great. And it it's... As we as, you know, having knowing what what comes nest next this is a great setup that he's, you know, flying high, you know, you know, feeling like an angel. And

358
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:21,804
doing the right thing and everyone daisy in this... And and the the secretary making it feel good about himself and that even spills on the next page as well.

359
00:35:22,522 --> 00:35:23,022
And

360
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,073
it's it's all getting set up

361
00:35:25,652 --> 00:35:31,706
for what what comes next. And you're right. I mean, this is a... That he doesn't look at the card, and that that seems to be in

362
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:38,872
the constant theme from in the comics that Donald gets some of trouble when he doesn't do something that you would think would be kind of obvious

363
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:54,160
and this is just he's full speed pulls team ahead and he doesn't... Even if people around them or especially the kids are saying, you know what? You may wanna look to the side and shut things out and see what you're doing and. He he's not gonna do that. He just... He's going forward. Yeah. And it it sets it sets it up very nicely.

364
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,060
So in the in the following page, he again, it continues.

365
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:15,272
He says I feel good all over, and he's gonna make Al extra big turkey. He's all excited about it. And then as he's running home to get ready, he that's when he gets the the the worst news of his lifetime when he realizes if the person he's going to prepare the dinner... The meal for is glad gander and of course,

366
00:36:15,785 --> 00:36:16,884
know, anyone who's

367
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:19,601
with the Gladstone knows this is just the the worst

368
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:27,882
the worst news, the donald could have and, you know, almost... I mean, if you read enough comments, you can almost guess that that was what the name was gonna be.

369
00:36:28,378 --> 00:36:32,902
Right. Beforehand. And that's a great panel when he's surprised, and there's there's no

370
00:36:33,215 --> 00:36:41,490
there's no scenery behind him there at all. It's Barks wants to just focus on foul the, you know, is just Al gas and he wants to really capture that

371
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:49,675
and then. It's an awesome panel. I love I love the donald leap up into the air in in a gas

372
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:53,999
discussed panels. Yeah. That's that's gotta be one of my favorites and other of these.

373
00:36:54,597 --> 00:37:09,457
Yeah. That's great. Yeah that's it. It's a it's a nice picture there. So he he says are I gotta get out of this so he goes back to the good neighbor's club, and of course, they're closed apparently they closed and they must lock the door and last immediately after he walked out. And then he decides he's gonna go to Daisy and

374
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:12,963
see if she can help him and, of course, she's left as well

375
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:14,296
very quickly.

376
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,487
And it's it's interesting that,

377
00:37:17,344 --> 00:37:17,464
you know,

378
00:37:18,621 --> 00:37:25,265
when I was re reread the story, and I know we were texting earlier, it's remarkable. We're gonna see more of this in the story where Barks uses, you know,

379
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:29,025
convenient things to keep the store moving forward, you know,

380
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:38,885
that, you know, they they left very Daisy left town. She he needs an older door and out of town back Friday. So leading donald with no other choice

381
00:37:39,463 --> 00:37:43,935
and the and and you know, Barks uses that to move the story forward and

382
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:45,935
since it's so well done, we're we're

383
00:37:46,355 --> 00:37:49,527
we're willing to forgive him that and and goodbye. Enjoy the ride.

384
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:53,180
Right. The timing is gonna be very convenient.

385
00:37:54,077 --> 00:38:03,766
David, I I think as I've like, been doing this podcast and getting to talk to to people who have kind of been involved with some of the comics, which has been really neat.

386
00:38:04,104 --> 00:38:09,005
I I think more about the things that Barks has to do to kind of

387
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:12,035
identify things for his readers and signal.

388
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:12,952
And,

389
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:24,616
you know, we know all about glad Gander Al long time Barks fans. But there's a good chance that a first time reader may have no idea. He's... He's only appeared in a couple of stories.

390
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:32,450
Before this. He's still a pretty new character at this point. I think it's just three years since he appeared in in his debut.

391
00:38:32,925 --> 00:38:35,863
And and his luck doesn't really factor

392
00:38:36,242 --> 00:38:42,196
in this one. You know, this is this is one of those stories where he's just gonna be kinda of the shift twists.

393
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:43,050
Version.

394
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:49,570
I think he at the very end, the whole thing but the something goes that we'll got to it and might factor in there. But yeah. Yeah.

395
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:53,082
But you're right. He's just sort of the foil in this

396
00:38:53,979 --> 00:39:06,120
more so than they're not focusing on the locked part that, you know, that's not it. He's just basically you know, Donald introduces himself as you said, He says Right. He's no course person he's no good at professional.

397
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,424
So even someone who was not familiar with god's would kinda get the impression.

398
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:22,274
It's going odd here. So he does a quick, you know, job of introducing him, and and you're right. He is gonna specifically call out. Glad, I think he got his luck just a few issues

399
00:39:23,093 --> 00:39:29,841
before this and and race to the south c's, I think was the first one. So, like, he calls it out in this one. But

400
00:39:30,419 --> 00:39:42,354
much more of the story is really just devoted to to the fact that he's a shift moo. Right. In this one, And Barks hadn't really like, moved on from that aspect of his character.

401
00:39:42,932 --> 00:39:48,960
I think at this point. So let's see. As you say, Al everything kind of coincidentally,

402
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:53,029
he he figures out the daisy is out of town. Barks

403
00:39:53,148 --> 00:39:55,619
Friday because of a note that she's left on the door.

404
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,753
And we see him

405
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:00,282
just super determined to, like,

406
00:40:01,054 --> 00:40:05,877
phone every member of the good neighbor's club, so you won't be stuck with that bum.

407
00:40:06,435 --> 00:40:14,242
But of course, by the time he gets home Gladstone has clearly already been notified because he's waiting on his front snoop,

408
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:20,386
and and he's learned about you know, who who is gonna be feeding him on Thanksgiving.

409
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:21,966
And Donald,

410
00:40:22,786 --> 00:40:25,801
he says that that's a big error they made.

411
00:40:26,361 --> 00:40:28,901
And and now we get a pretty classic cousin

412
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:30,661
kind of put up your dupes

413
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:31,661
hose

414
00:40:32,576 --> 00:40:38,116
And and, you know, David, I like the little bits of vocabulary that I probably learned

415
00:40:38,496 --> 00:40:40,076
for the first time as a kid

416
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,451
because Gladstone says you're gonna rene.

417
00:40:44,031 --> 00:40:45,651
You're gonna be a cheap well

418
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:54,606
And and I I I think I think I picked up really a lot of vocabularies yeah. Through contacts reading. Absolutely Al. That's.

419
00:40:55,846 --> 00:40:56,281
And

420
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,299
Gladstone

421
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:03,691
implies that he'll report Donald to the newspapers as refusing to feed as starving there.

422
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:09,231
Yeah. He's this is just the beginning. This is like, the appetizer of,

423
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:16,562
you know, Glad. Not he's going to enjoy his Thanksgiving me all he's going to. You know, do everything can to torture your donald.

424
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:25,436
It right. That... That's half the enjoyment for him is the fact that he's able to towards your donald who with what who with the fact these forced to provide them a a free meal.

425
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:30,216
Alright. And and, of course, like, we feel a little bit for Donald

426
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:37,721
because he wanted to do something noble and pure. But on the other hand, he really could just suck it up and have his cousin over.

427
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:40,587
One one lousy meal.

428
00:41:40,924 --> 00:41:53,882
Yeah. So I I get. I... You're right. I never really thought about it that way. I was I was... When I read this mark, I always think I'm a hundred percent donald. You know, I I can't stand Glad and Right. There's no way he deserves this and

429
00:41:54,355 --> 00:42:04,811
by the end. You're definitely right because the the... What Gladstone is gonna inflict upon him. Right. Totally un recalled for. Donald could've have like, very easily

430
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:06,531
avoid all of this but.

431
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,591
Yeah. So yeah.

432
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:12,591
It he takes he... Yeah. Barks he digs himself and even deeper as well as we'll see.

433
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,817
It's an interesting a little little bit bit in the in the next page he...

434
00:42:17,395 --> 00:42:21,186
He... He's Donald believes that he has something to hold over Glad. Glad.

435
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:31,819
Says, you know, I'm gonna, you know, report you to the papers that you're not falling through and what you promised and Donald says, I'm gonna expose you that you're a professional mood. And Gladstone says something interesting.

436
00:42:32,474 --> 00:42:34,567
That the the the the good neighbors

437
00:42:35,063 --> 00:43:02,284
investigated him and found him wanting those year old ladies actually we when I told them I'd never worked the day in my life, which is an interesting way to put it. I mean, you and I and the reader know it's that is the mood just basically takes priority and, you know, enjoys himself. But the the the the the nice ladies of the charity interpreted that is you can't find work and he's trying the best of hand and it's one of those statements that can be read. However you want based on your sensibilities.

438
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:07,126
It's a it's a very funny panel. Yeah. That that just the expressive

439
00:43:07,464 --> 00:43:16,645
between the two of them Donald growing in response. Right. He's frustrated not only that Gladstone don't got away with it, but that, you know, nobody else sees him for what he is.

440
00:43:17,143 --> 00:43:17,303
Right.

441
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,536
And then donald

442
00:43:19,996 --> 00:43:38,600
brick that he's gonna attack Gladstone of course, the kids realized that that's the... You know, this is right when they finally intervene. They've been just watching until now, but here they're just like Okay. Donald. You know. Okay. I'll get Al he we can't do this. You know. Enough and enough. You know, you you can't you can't able to break and they explain to him what... You know, that that he has to do it

443
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:42,352
and we're seeing, you know, more of these these wonderful

444
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,667
expressions the Donald has of just

445
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:45,140
you know,

446
00:43:46,018 --> 00:43:46,518
anger

447
00:43:46,936 --> 00:43:48,891
humiliation, you know, frustration,

448
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,988
just every every

449
00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:53,641
iteration of those emotions that you can imagine.

450
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:57,032
It's almost as if if you compare the expressions throughout

451
00:43:57,411 --> 00:44:01,601
it's almost if Barks deliberately wanted to come up with a different way of

452
00:44:02,259 --> 00:44:18,406
he didn't wanna use the same look in any panel. I mean, you know, he wants to say. I wanna do another look of humiliation, but different from the last one. Right you know, he'll come up with another way of doing it. So at the end of the page, he he's reconciled himself, and he's gonna have to do this and and Gladstone is now really trying to pour it on.

453
00:44:19,379 --> 00:44:24,709
Explaining what he expects for the meal. I'll have Chrome dressing in the turkey with just a pinch of stage.

454
00:44:25,647 --> 00:44:55,099
He's he's so specific about exactly how he wants in. Expect donald to performant, of course, donald and Al little bubble is he's thinking and carpet caps and the pie, you know, he's just, you know, he's he's a receiving ball of rage and he knows right what he's gonna do, but he knows this this can't this can happen. So... Yeah. I can see why you why you advocate for this one, because this this story is this page is about as strong as any that Barks is done. Like, There there are three

455
00:44:55,438 --> 00:45:04,186
just individual panels here that kinda make me laugh out loud or at least check. You know, that one I mentioned. And then that one party just worthless

456
00:45:04,486 --> 00:45:07,321
going to grab for the brick. That cracks me up

457
00:45:08,421 --> 00:45:11,081
And and then and as you say that little

458
00:45:12,141 --> 00:45:20,682
gag where Glad stone below, and he's just thinking to himself about putting carbon taxes yeah. It's very funny. I also see

459
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,696
why Barks is, like,

460
00:45:23,709 --> 00:45:24,209
accessible

461
00:45:24,547 --> 00:45:25,964
around the world because

462
00:45:26,821 --> 00:45:30,646
kind of picture all of these exchanges without any die.

463
00:45:31,464 --> 00:45:36,795
Yeah. You can you can follow along pretty fact you can. You can. Yeah. Absolutely.

464
00:45:37,452 --> 00:45:37,952
So

465
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:43,841
we transition on the next page to Donald just doing. And

466
00:45:44,501 --> 00:45:54,496
he gets this bright idea. He... He's struck with an idea, and he says He wants the Ducktales to pretend to leave town, so he's gonna call the newspapers

467
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:56,016
and make an announcement.

468
00:45:56,570 --> 00:46:00,518
And David, this cracks me up right on this page and the last page.

469
00:46:01,555 --> 00:46:14,696
It might be exaggerated a little bit how much the two docs wanna bring like the local paper into this. But I've gotta imagine not that much, right? Like the local paper figured much more prominently.

470
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:18,721
Kind of in the the day to day working of of the town.

471
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:26,074
To to the point that on the next panel, we see Gladstone literally in the free reading room. Of the library

472
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,990
reading, You know, he

473
00:46:28,408 --> 00:46:29,405
everyone read the paper.

474
00:46:30,243 --> 00:46:32,539
It's how you learned what was happening.

475
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:38,297
So I I like that. This this one feels like such a time capsule for this period

476
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:40,252
in America. Than me. Absolutely.

477
00:46:40,748 --> 00:46:41,865
So Gladstone

478
00:46:41,905 --> 00:46:42,684
sees the.

479
00:46:43,716 --> 00:46:49,856
I guess it's not... I can't imagine it's a big headline. They sees the story donald Inducks called to Florida

480
00:46:50,356 --> 00:46:58,751
and he goes on to read good or duck regret that you will not be home Thanksgiving. To host poor disturbing guests.

481
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:05,161
And and this is the first time we see glad stone Barks in the story as he runs out to

482
00:47:05,499 --> 00:47:08,474
confront Donald and steaks out outside the house.

483
00:47:08,813 --> 00:47:14,557
And the shade is drawn, but but he is able to hear some voices. Yes. So

484
00:47:14,895 --> 00:47:15,954
he here's the voices,

485
00:47:16,492 --> 00:47:22,435
as he said, Barks, and quickly discovers that they're they're hiding out there. They figure they're just gonna head out till

486
00:47:22,812 --> 00:47:26,939
after thanksgiving, but he hears them and he now he really has them over the barrel.

487
00:47:27,555 --> 00:47:30,820
And what she says, now I've really got you the barrel. And

488
00:47:31,357 --> 00:47:31,977
not only

489
00:47:32,314 --> 00:47:35,606
does, you know, donald now has in Thanksgiving

490
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:39,354
provide the thanksgiving meal to the glad, but

491
00:47:39,986 --> 00:48:04,014
Gladstone can threaten to expose him. I guess what he... What did you say printing false? Yeah. Why don't you read that? I like... I really like the sequence of dialogue there. Yeah. Now I've really got you over a barrel printing false rumors as a crime. Do I expose you or do I and Al says, do you what? And then leaves us hanging to the next panel and the cloud says, do I eat Thanksgiving dinner with you in Florida?

492
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:11,008
So following goes oh as he realizes now, he's on the hook not only for a meal, but for flying

493
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:18,106
him his nephews and Gladstone is no good cousin to Floor. Right. And and now we're now we're off and running

494
00:48:18,483 --> 00:48:18,882
in Florida.

495
00:48:19,694 --> 00:48:26,307
It's... Yeah, Mark, That's a it's a great transition right there to... From things have gone for bad donald. Right.

496
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:40,279
And you know, in another story, I could see this almost being the lead up to some adventure in Florida. But but Barks isn't really interested in Florida except as just, you know, a little bit of antique

497
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:41,318
to

498
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:45,523
before the get get home. And and the next sequence

499
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:46,599
is

500
00:48:47,495 --> 00:48:47,995
basically,

501
00:48:48,412 --> 00:48:49,869
it's all about

502
00:48:50,365 --> 00:48:52,476
Glad stone x distracting

503
00:48:53,134 --> 00:48:54,593
whatever he can,

504
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:55,432
chi

505
00:48:55,851 --> 00:48:57,470
like more luxurious

506
00:48:58,088 --> 00:48:59,387
and more expensive.

507
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,440
Everything

508
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:06,827
out of Donald. And and it's a little bit of a stretch. Right? Because at some point, we know in the real world

509
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:17,960
maybe Donald would go along with the trip to Florida save face, but but there's nothing stopping him from just saying look I took you to Florida. We're staying at a decent hotel

510
00:49:18,337 --> 00:49:31,111
so you can tell like that an adequate hotel. Right Right. But but it it definitely works in the vein of the story. Right? He what what the reader knows is that Gladstone has donald over a barrel and

511
00:49:31,452 --> 00:49:37,351
and now he's just gonna take advantage of him. We do get some good, like, specific details

512
00:49:38,146 --> 00:49:44,366
And any of them that you particularly liked as as to the sort of like things that hub angles goals are donald

513
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:48,961
I mean, everything. I mean, everything in this next sequence is just u great. I mean,

514
00:49:49,961 --> 00:49:54,686
that that line... That's one of those lines burning in my brain when you breeze in the one Floor air, and he says,

515
00:49:55,404 --> 00:50:09,516
Romantic, Florida who but lucky Glad Gander could come here free. Correct. It's it's He's just having... He's having the time of his life and and donald his, you know, just starting being beginning to see than, you know, he he decide using go to the most expensive

516
00:50:09,896 --> 00:50:19,510
hotel in the area, the wander build and, you know, the the cab... The the the cab driver that, you know, conveniently says, can you afford it? Know, setting up the next line

517
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:25,463
even the name sq bills. Water just funny. Yeah. Right because because it's

518
00:50:26,016 --> 00:50:30,620
It's gotta be a parity of the the ty name Van bill. Absolutely

519
00:50:31,037 --> 00:50:36,895
the word sq for spend. Yep. I like the Or the alligator

520
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:38,690
skin vest

521
00:50:39,148 --> 00:50:41,657
for ninety eight dollars that he has my

522
00:50:42,277 --> 00:50:42,777
at

523
00:50:43,357 --> 00:50:43,857
is

524
00:50:44,157 --> 00:51:01,277
ninety dollars gotta be like eight hundred dollars an hour or something. It's Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty pricey. And boy. David look. Take a look at each one of Donald like win. I'm sure you have if you love the story. Yeah. But but each of his win reactions is like better than the last.

525
00:51:01,577 --> 00:51:06,951
Right. He's Barks is clearly trying to come up with every possible way. He can draw you know,

526
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,489
disbelief Huey, humiliation,

527
00:51:09,988 --> 00:51:23,837
you know, in the faces and then then when he's he's when they're in the hotel room and and the Gladstone says to the to the the Bell hop, tip yourself a five like charge it to my cousin bill. Right. You know, which is, like, whatever forty or fifty dollars now.

528
00:51:24,532 --> 00:51:29,435
Is collapsed, you know, on the bed. Can't believe what's what's happening here.

529
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:33,102
Yeah. Every every look in his face is just... It's priceless.

530
00:51:33,837 --> 00:51:47,312
And it and that's one of those stories too where glad stone being so rep apprehensive, where he he he like convince the nephews base sick lead to to, you know, he drives the nephews essentially

531
00:51:47,812 --> 00:51:48,312
to

532
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:54,182
Donald level because you don't always see that. Yeah. Know. You're absolutely right. They seem if you look Al the looks on their faces,

533
00:51:54,621 --> 00:51:57,817
Huey,. You know, some of the time they're they're angry Al Gladstone

534
00:51:58,352 --> 00:52:13,907
but they're also happy to be in Florida. You know, they're not quite to the point where they're not angry. Like Donald is. And then you're right, they slowly as they see they're uncle, we'd be humiliated more and more. They they finally have just about had it. And they're they're right there with all Yeah. That night, so we have a silhouette of them.

535
00:52:14,501 --> 00:52:23,143
The kids say that we... We've gotta figure out we've got to figure a way to get you out of this power. So now they're on they're on the mcdonald there there's a way of

536
00:52:23,577 --> 00:52:31,197
they've gotta to figure this out together. So donald his usual way hasn't a bright idea. I guess, the second bright idea he's had to get out of

537
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,525
a problem with Gladstone, and

538
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,118
and then we go right into

539
00:52:35,654 --> 00:52:45,722
the next morning where we see what their run is gonna be. So next morning, so they they they get a motor boat, and they're gonna go for a tour of the lagoon and and and

540
00:52:46,221 --> 00:53:04,071
glad stone a little skeptical, but they managed they could been it. There'll be plenty of time to get back for Thanksgiving. Although Donald does have that kind evil looking his eye, then, I guess Gladstone wasn't seeing when he Barks and board. Well Know I'm sorry, David. Did you mention what the Nephews like bright idea was this morning? That that morning. Oh, I'm sorry.

541
00:53:05,911 --> 00:53:08,391
You're right. They they said we could lose him in the swap Yeah.

542
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:14,426
Realizes that's the case. So I guess, yeah, this wasn't a surprise. So we're... This setup up is...

543
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:30,126
We know what's gonna happen or some some general outline of what's gonna happen in the next step. They're gonna lose him in the swamp. So they get out the motor boat and and they manage to to trick Gladstone to climb up on the bow to look for pearls. And once they find a nice little

544
00:53:30,466 --> 00:53:31,806
tiny little island and they

545
00:53:32,186 --> 00:53:32,826
dump him there,

546
00:53:34,186 --> 00:53:37,781
they ran the island leaving and there and leaving them stranded. And

547
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:50,182
they speed away claiming that the boat gone wild and they can't stop it. And got some remarks that for both the running while that thing sure takes the curve beautifully as we see it worthiness and out of the goes perfectly

548
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,751
avoiding all the islands. So he he knows something's things up this is

549
00:53:54,490 --> 00:54:06,470
just an accident that they they look to this tab. Yeah. It's a fun sequence. I don't know there's too much more to say about it. So so the next bit is basically Glad stone stew on the island and

550
00:54:07,288 --> 00:54:14,045
it's interesting. He Barks has him thinking, I'll get out of here. My good luck has never failed me yet. But

551
00:54:15,321 --> 00:54:25,406
but Huey, he's going to a little bit of actual effort, here, right, which is kind of typical for glass. But but you know, Barks needs to get him off the island and see kind creative way.

552
00:54:26,578 --> 00:54:28,592
So you find some flaming

553
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:35,185
that seem to be pretty tame any fashions a sort of basket this sort of hammock out of

554
00:54:36,281 --> 00:54:37,779
leaves. That looks like

555
00:54:38,356 --> 00:54:45,061
what's that tree that is always, like, kind of looking like ripping in the south... The we can... Like, we.

556
00:54:45,561 --> 00:54:47,721
Yeah. It does kinda look like a wee willow of that.

557
00:54:48,921 --> 00:55:00,000
But so I guess I guess after that work, he Al least does get to kind of relax and his flaming ham and he says, a little more speed, you glorified crow I'm hungry.

558
00:55:00,579 --> 00:55:06,253
And as we get to dinner time, you know, we transition back to the Ducktales,

559
00:55:06,133 --> 00:55:06,633
nearly

560
00:55:07,052 --> 00:55:07,552
assure

561
00:55:08,026 --> 00:55:10,986
excited to go enjoy their Thanksgiving Turkey.

562
00:55:11,546 --> 00:55:19,701
Yeah. It makes me wonder what their plan was for how a rescue Gladstone. Do they just figure you would somehow eventually make it back or they go one...

563
00:55:20,001 --> 00:55:25,401
I don't know... I guess that's that's a a a bit of a plot hold there that we don't. We don't have to worry about because it's a common.

564
00:55:26,176 --> 00:55:26,256
Right.

565
00:55:27,696 --> 00:55:29,356
So they come assure

566
00:55:30,056 --> 00:55:31,176
after Gladstone

567
00:55:31,656 --> 00:55:34,090
because they had fun on their rented motor

568
00:55:34,589 --> 00:55:36,966
exploring the the swamp. And they're greeting on

569
00:55:37,865 --> 00:55:38,604
by a

570
00:55:38,943 --> 00:55:57,385
looks like a police officer who says, if you're donald Doc, you're want at the hospital. Your cousins there in bad shape. So, you know, after enjoying the day and, you know, running around there. The motor going the scenery now they it back to reality and realize that something glad someone's got something more bad the store for them. They.

571
00:55:58,103 --> 00:55:59,242
I love the

572
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:07,720
the interaction with the doctor, Dave. Do you mind just reading that exchange? Yeah. No. That's that's great. Yeah. He burst into the

573
00:56:08,058 --> 00:56:12,932
into the the patient's room there and and the doctors he says Gladstone.

574
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:21,407
How did how did you get here? What happened and Gladstone is too sick to respond and that the doctor says nothing to be proud of. I assure you.

575
00:56:22,061 --> 00:56:23,321
It's just a great line.

576
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:37,461
And then he goes on to explain the the the amount of money he spent eating a thirty pound turkey by itself. And the doctor has the bill from the from the water hotel, and then also the the the the the emergency room bill as well, which is expensive.

577
00:56:38,059 --> 00:56:38,559
I

578
00:56:39,057 --> 00:56:44,752
all of this. As as a physician, you're very familiar with thrust the bill

579
00:56:45,088 --> 00:56:51,711
into the the face of the patient's fan. Yeah. That does that doesn't happen these days, but it's a it's a convenient,

580
00:56:52,370 --> 00:57:13,411
like, maybe back in those days day. I imagine they they would have done that. And I don't know why the doctor would have the bill from the hotel, but for some random. If this is just Barks is being economical. But it's it's very very funny. Even if it it's funny. And, you know, and and and... That's definitely one of those points and what regarding the story and thinking about it where there's a lot of sort of hard to believe coincidence

581
00:57:13,788 --> 00:57:24,964
that that he uses to propel the story forward. And... And you know what, as a reader, I don't mind it because it's a great story. The gag are fantastic. And we understand it's a comic book. So we're willing to

582
00:57:25,383 --> 00:57:33,246
overlook that because we we just love the characters and the stories so much. Right. Yeah. He's got his punch line there and he's delivering. He's just delivering it very efficiently.

583
00:57:33,661 --> 00:57:46,133
Yeah. And that sweating is running up the storm there can't believe that he's on... If not not not able to believe he's on the hook for all of this. That he never never imagine we you have to pay for. So... And then and then the final scene we see donald

584
00:57:46,712 --> 00:57:49,290
home again, and he wander into the

585
00:57:50,188 --> 00:58:06,656
the good neighbor club and ask daisy if, you know, how things are going and she says they're doing the the same thing for Christmas, and donald as always is the poor will put their names in this Barks before and and daisy he said, yes. And and so immediately donald has

586
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,666
cards filled out with...

587
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:14,182
His name, Donald, dewey Hue and Loop, and they are going to need a free dinner for giving.

588
00:58:15,313 --> 00:58:18,127
Daisy can't believe it. And as Donald,

589
00:58:18,942 --> 00:58:38,426
as she says you you're putting... You're putting in for a free dinner. He says, yes, and baby, how we're going to need it. It's Al nice little twist at the end that that he went from the beginning having a extra money to help out some poor to now being dead broke himself or not even able to afford to meal for the next holiday. So... Yeah, it's a really good,

590
00:58:38,846 --> 00:58:43,956
like, book ended gag. Yeah. He he finishes right where he started. He's.

591
00:58:44,934 --> 00:58:50,683
Boy, those four panels are really just really well structured the way he

592
00:58:51,542 --> 00:59:08,624
sub converts the fact that, it's it's predictable to an adult reader, But it's it's a really good solid gag. A really good sub subversion of of what happened at the beginning. Yeah. No. You're right, Barks. It's it's nice how he does that I, you know, re reread and thinking about it it's, you know,

593
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,497
when when I just would read a story,

594
00:59:11,991 --> 00:59:24,863
just to enjoy, I never really thought about how difficult it must have been for Barks to figure out what am I gonna put in each panel and how how much to put in a panel what to put the next panel and to keep it to keep it a moving story. And,

595
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:32,432
you know, it's it's a real are to be able to condense so much in a in a small space with limited room for dialogue

596
00:59:32,812 --> 00:59:43,222
to express everything you know, and and a nice balance between the expressions and their faces and then the unlimited of dialogue and you'd be able to propel the action forward and so a few panels. It's it's great. I mean, that's this is a

597
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,324
no I'm master Al work. Yeah. Yeah. Both of these stories have been very tightly

598
00:59:48,661 --> 00:59:49,020
constructed.

599
00:59:49,817 --> 00:59:59,137
This last one is just a lot lot busier. Right? Like it it in a good way. It has... It has a lot going on, you know, he moves from Duff to Florida.

600
01:00:00,109 --> 01:00:01,048
Very efficiently.

601
01:00:01,386 --> 01:00:01,785
I...

602
01:00:02,263 --> 01:00:06,593
Let's let's go ahead. Let's let's talk about, you know, how these stories

603
01:00:07,264 --> 01:00:22,030
compare it's very convenient to compare these since the community has like, placed them basically in a tie yep. That and I've gotta say, like, I'm I'm convinced you. This is a favor of yours. I'm not gonna say that it's suddenly a favorite of mine.

604
01:00:22,788 --> 01:00:24,803
But I do think this is a very

605
01:00:25,235 --> 01:00:29,288
very strong Thanksgiving story. And and much stronger

606
01:00:29,746 --> 01:00:43,024
than the the late forties one that we did on the terrible turkey, which which know, I I did find very enjoyable. Yep. But there's just... There's a lot more moving parts in this one. Really great expressive artwork

607
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:57,134
The the the ryan... I I do love to hate Glad. Yeah yeah. Yeah. He... Just about every story he's in his. Is fantastic. The the model room between the two of them. I also like how, you know, in a typical Gladstone story

608
01:00:57,713 --> 01:01:04,157
there's a twist at the end where it doesn't actually end up the way, you know, you expect it to and off glad.

609
01:01:04,556 --> 01:01:09,301
May win, but not really when right. If you think about it and, you know, we could list off any other

610
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,577
stories, but that's the case. And

611
01:01:12,713 --> 01:01:21,616
there's always a twist at the end. And in this case, you know, technically one, but in Donald humiliated, but Gladstone. Certainly is is not a happy person at the end. He's having

612
01:01:22,436 --> 01:01:27,296
pounds Huey,. He's he's pretty darn miserable. So he can't exactly cause

613
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:30,625
call Gladstone the winter in this one. But I...

614
01:01:30,963 --> 01:01:33,857
Yeah... Yeah. This definitely as you said, this Barks this...

615
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:35,866
It's it's wonderful. To store the

616
01:01:36,206 --> 01:01:57,587
the level of humiliation that has to undergo and it just drawn out. It just doesn't... It's not one panel or one or couple of panels. It's just, you know, Barks is enjoying just as like glad is enjoying torturing donald. You know, every step of the way, and it's it's it's fun. It's fun to refund a watch and see see the valve goes through.

617
01:01:58,598 --> 01:02:14,587
Yeah. The expressions on his face are just... Or we're really priced They they really are. There there a couple of, like, very strong pages here. That one that I mentioned with the the near brick flop the throwing. Yeah. But but also the one

618
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:20,076
with Glad stone just lord it over. That that page is so

619
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,915
funny.

620
01:02:21,254 --> 01:02:25,405
And it's got such a great progression of humiliate she Barks.

621
01:02:25,504 --> 01:02:27,941
Bob's really likes to see Donald.

622
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:36,438
Yeah. No. It does. That that is. That is a great page. The the brick thing. He doesn't say anything already because it runs for the brick.

623
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:43,787
And that that just says all you need. You know, Barks is really brilliant without where he keeps the dialogue

624
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:45,957
to an absolute minimum.

625
01:02:47,073 --> 01:02:48,769
And let's the... Let's the

626
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,434
the drawing speak for itself. I'm thinking other pages that I like. I mean,

627
01:02:53,232 --> 01:03:06,287
maybe just know, we do like... I'd I do like to highlight favorite panels as well even though I I... I've been known forget that segment from time to time. But are there any any panels or pages that we didn't, like, highlight?

628
01:03:06,781 --> 01:03:10,495
That you'd like to call specific attention to and either of these stories?

629
01:03:11,175 --> 01:03:13,272
I do like what you said the that

630
01:03:14,106 --> 01:03:15,325
you know, the panel where.

631
01:03:15,903 --> 01:03:19,958
But, you know, Gladstone was demanding a a a pinch of sage.

632
01:03:20,537 --> 01:03:20,617
Yeah.

633
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,845
And he has his fingers there. In that.

634
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,317
Yeah. That this is perfect.

635
01:03:26,934 --> 01:03:27,333
Doubt.

636
01:03:28,489 --> 01:03:31,236
I... You know, that that's great. I mean, any one of the ones

637
01:03:32,173 --> 01:03:39,768
where they're at the hotel and and bottle realizes every extra expense that's going to it's gonna add. Yeah. We we skipped over that working

638
01:03:40,081 --> 01:03:56,027
Gladstone says, he wants a sweet with gold door knobs and Al leopard leopard skin drape. Right. I I can't imagine imagine that any hotel would have such a thing. But, you know, maybe maybe glad read brochure that this water building isn't where that that they do provide such executives here. So

639
01:03:56,901 --> 01:04:01,396
he's ready to enjoy himself. But... Yeah, I this is one of those hotels that'll

640
01:04:01,735 --> 01:04:13,516
make it happen for... They will make it happen. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So, David, I I really appreciate you going to bat for this story, because I've gotta say I've got kind of a new appreciation.

641
01:04:14,411 --> 01:04:17,311
I'd say it's... I'd say it's not really accurately

642
01:04:17,611 --> 01:04:18,111
ranked

643
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:27,910
by how the community is has kinda got it. Situated. It's a it's a pretty strong one. I I think I I can't remember if I mentioned this, but I looked it up and I had kinda calculated

644
01:04:28,527 --> 01:04:28,921
that

645
01:04:29,898 --> 01:04:32,034
any story that was...

646
01:04:32,492 --> 01:04:39,916
Oh, yeah. I I did mention the point. Right? That point is, like, seven point two too. So we these are basically both Al the fiftieth

647
01:04:40,216 --> 01:04:42,916
percentile. This reads more like an upper

648
01:04:43,256 --> 01:04:43,756
quartile.

649
01:04:44,669 --> 01:04:53,303
Yeah. To me or sell. I I'll just mention kind of where it stacks up against the other Thanksgiving stories. They as it happens,

650
01:04:53,855 --> 01:04:54,953
all of them

651
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:59,340
except for his first... The the the oldest

652
01:05:00,475 --> 01:05:02,570
one where he does like a little shooting

653
01:05:03,307 --> 01:05:03,581
competition

654
01:05:04,121 --> 01:05:04,941
at the...

655
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:13,395
To try to win a turkey. Mh. That one gets to seven point four. All of the others are in the seven point two. Neighborhood.

656
01:05:13,733 --> 01:05:19,218
But that does encompass quite a few. So, like, it ranges from eight hundred and eleven

657
01:05:19,914 --> 01:05:27,315
rank to one thousand one hundred and for. Then in general, they're they're clustered together for the most yeah part. Yeah.

658
01:05:28,393 --> 01:05:34,142
Is this your favorite of his five different thanksgiving stories. Yeah. I I would say this is.

659
01:05:34,522 --> 01:05:35,701
The other one you mentioned,

660
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:46,224
it's the one where I think that the kids Win a turkey the raffle and then Donald wins the shooting contest and Yeah. That's all That's also it. You say can't

661
01:05:46,563 --> 01:06:00,829
you you should you're on themselves that that was last. You did that. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's a that's a fun one too. They they can't themselves to do it. And that's a great and that's a great business that we're that with respect for the turkey because he he fought so hard, so another.

662
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:02,083
Yeah.

663
01:06:02,841 --> 01:06:05,134
That's a pretty great sequence to

664
01:06:06,165 --> 01:06:11,659
I think that one might be my favorite. I also remember quite enjoying the

665
01:06:12,238 --> 01:06:22,773
the other one named turkey trouble, although admittedly, it's been a long time, so I'll have to check and on that next year. But, yeah. I I think I think we covered these stories really nicely.

666
01:06:23,366 --> 01:06:26,686
And and David, I really appreciate you joining me for these.

667
01:06:27,406 --> 01:06:28,866

668
01:06:29,246 --> 01:06:45,180
thoughts about these or just anything else No. I think so so I I appreciate you're having me on your podcast mark. This is this is very enjoyable, and and it's it's nice to speak to another Barks fan or there a lot Of us out there. We're just scattered around.

669
01:06:45,999 --> 01:06:46,499
Exactly.

670
01:06:47,077 --> 01:06:48,191

That through America culture, they they do get that. That's right.

681
01:07:26,078 --> 01:07:30,649
Although, I'm sure I'm sure they get their fill of American culture. I'm sure to go.

But but thanks again, David. Take care. Alright. You use walmart. Take care.
