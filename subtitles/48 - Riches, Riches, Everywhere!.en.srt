1
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,495
We can have

2
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:37,825
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer an artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comments of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological

3
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:59,215
publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever a Grown man who enjoys Inducks comics. I Al joined once again by Warren, Warren, could you

4
00:00:59,753 --> 00:01:00,253
reintroduce

5
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:12,645
yourself and I've had you on a lot. What thing. Let me ask you. Who is your favorite Barks side character? Oh my side character. Villain or side character

6
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:21,900
or... I have a soft spot for gyro Gu. I really do. His solo stories with helper are some of the most invent, humorous,

7
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,780
big just a a breath of fresh here for me. A solid choice. I'll I have to have you on for the eventual

8
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,360
Ji short stories.

9
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:30,053
Episode.

10
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:42,350
Deaf. Yeah. I've been doing this for a while. I'm a long time Barks collector and comic fan and Barks fan. So... Yeah. Yeah. And and today, we get to talk about a very fun story

11
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,730
We're talking about riches, riches,

12
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:50,485
everywhere. And I'm pretending that we're not recording this immediately after the...

13
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:59,780
It's it's fellow comic book may in uncle Scrooge number eleven. Right? This is a pretty unique issue. It had two sixteen

14
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,580
pager.

15
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:05,034
So I I wanna keep them their own episodes though.

16
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:08,235
Give them both their due. We we're... We've

17
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:09,035
recorded

18
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:17,951
the great steamboat race, and now we've moved on to rich rich everywhere. Which one's your favorite of those two one? Boy. I

19
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:20,560
how I wasn't ready for that, But I will say

20
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:24,710
the memories of steamboat rates, the great steamboat race probably

21
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:33,834
I remember more, I had not Red bridges rich everywhere a lot before this. Maybe once and so revisiting that story and how it reminded me of another

22
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:43,745
story that we'll talk about and was it... But... Yeah, I think great steamboat race. Right on. Yeah. I had it... I had a feeling you might. Right? And and for very understandable reason,

23
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:46,852
I think steamboat race probably

24
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:53,805
is technically the better story I just... I really like this one. I feel like it backs above its

25
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:55,805
above its weight. Right?

26
00:02:56,265 --> 00:03:02,299
Good point, I think it does too there's a lack of found in this story that that I that that that kind of recalls

27
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:15,178
why I recall some memories of some other stories. We'll we'll get into them as we walk through it. But it's it's it's classic in every way because you got the boys and die I'm so fascinated Al at dead Scrooge as well. Yeah. So rich rich

28
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:18,540
everywhere. But again, just like like in our last

29
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:31,849
episode. This one was released Al a cover date of September of nineteen fifty five, where still an uncle Scrooge eleven just like steamboat raised. This one has only been reprinted nine times.

30
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,677
Okay. And just like that b john t story, you've got it. Quick little sixteen

31
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:40,766
page adventure. Absolutely. This is...

32
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:43,398
Kind what I would call the Treasure hunt adventure.

33
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:45,573
Yeah. This is like

34
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:51,455
the the kind of like. Really focused on Scrooge is a great prospect.

35
00:03:51,953 --> 00:04:02,678
Right. And we've seen this, like, Al alluded to, of course, and back to the Blonde and only Al man, but, like, this this makes him out to be more than just an argo.

36
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:11,724
Right? He's more than just, like looking for gold or or or the copper that's briefly alluded to and poor old man.

37
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:13,864
But this really adds to his leg.

38
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:18,284
Legend his mythos and and in a very funny brisk.

39
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,319
It does. It does it. It shows he's the expert at doing this. And I think this is a

40
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:27,472
another classic story. What you said it well

41
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,466
where we see En Scrooge Al the expert

42
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:38,720
really, does this prospect in his deep down inside of him is gonna come out in this story and and his expertise is just marble

43
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:45,916
the the nephew is just marble at it. Right. So let me pan very briefly to the international audience

44
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,450
Yeah. I was looking at a couple of international titles.

45
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,824
I like the first one from France where it's La

46
00:04:55,722 --> 00:04:56,222
the.

47
00:04:56,641 --> 00:05:03,389
So that seems to be... I'm gonna risk it and not look up the translation that. It's the Ducktales family,

48
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:06,346
I'm not sure if exploit is

49
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:09,302
exploits as in minds or

50
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:12,990
explored. I'm thinking that's minds, the desert.

51
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,981
Yeah. That would make sense. And then

52
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:19,150
later on in France, it was

53
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:20,806
Rei

54
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:22,776
call pew.

55
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:30,812
But again, it's a pretty direct translation. It's just kinda has a great sound to. Right? I like it as riches and even more rich

56
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:37,379
I I like that one why. You said well, yeah. Well, if as long as as you don't speak French, I.

57
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:45,283
And then speaking of the title, the fun thing about it is that it's a pretty neat classical

58
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:46,241
illusion

59
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:48,514
Rich rich everywhere is...

60
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:53,854
It it has to be intended to be a reference to the old samuel c

61
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:56,781
poem, the rim of the ancient mariner

62
00:05:57,595 --> 00:05:59,729
with the the lyric water water

63
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:01,163
everywhere and

64
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:05,450
area dropped to drink or not a drop to drink.

65
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:09,085
I don't remember exactly how it goes. But it's cool poem

66
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,736
and it was very memorable

67
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:12,051
put to music

68
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:16,316
by my favorite heavy metal band, so I'm I'm just gonna

69
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,442
insert a couple a few brief seconds of that

70
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:29,246
a very few brief seconds of that into the podcast here. Because I don't want any copyright bots to to strike me down. But

71
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:31,997
here it is. A little little bit of the poem

72
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:33,671
set to some

73
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:36,480
great heavy metal courtesy of iron maiden.

74
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:38,874
That the title is based off of.

75
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:01,628
And look at that, I just succeeded in

76
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:09,240
getting my love for duck com and iron maiden in the same podcast. So only.

77
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:15,434
That's right. So when you and I both found this one reminiscent of a of a past

78
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:17,934
great story, the magic hour hourglass.

79
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:22,282
Did, we did. That to trip out to the desert and the...

80
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:39,939
Yeah. The the quest for water. I I don't know. It's a it's an interesting tail in that respect. It bark it fun one. Visited it a little bit. Yeah. I'll tell you when when I was a kid reading this, and this was somewhat of an early Barks story for me, so it might be a little bit of a nostalgic favorite.

81
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:43,839
I was obsessed with geology and minerals

82
00:07:44,274 --> 00:08:01,874
So this one really rubbed to me right. Are you ready to to dive right into this? I am, and I'll I'll share that vaccination with with minerals and and and rocks and gems. I I I remember as a twelve year old somehow, I got this... It was a cardboard box with every kind of

83
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:02,714
mineral

84
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:12,646
stone on it, and it was all there was copper there was led, and I just... I had it on my dresser in my room, and I just fascinated by kids can look at that kind of thing for.

85
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:30,819
Same thing. It was it was paid. It was glued onto to the board with a little... This is what it is. They there were eight or ten or twelve of them in there, and I just... Yeah. I think I yeah you know, who... What what young boy or girl didn't wanna go out and fix four. I I think I think you may have figured out some grand gifts.

86
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:32,360
Here you go.

87
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,769
Alright. So rich rich everywhere. We we mentioned the last episode that unusually,

88
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:45,931
we did not start out in the Money Bin. And and we are back to it. Right? Barks is signaling

89
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:47,247
signaling

90
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:55,202
screws wealth to us. And and this is a storytelling device that he'll use frequently somewhat frequently where he is

91
00:08:55,901 --> 00:09:04,529
his grand nephews with tales of his ex exploits. It is tell us again Scrooge how you how you made all of this money

92
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:06,529
and he is

93
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,809
kinda of below

94
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:10,305
he is po

95
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:14,505
about how he made it with a pick and shovel. And usually,

96
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:16,800
he talks about the

97
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:21,071
a wide variety of adventurous things. You know, me...

98
00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:25,262
Maybe Huey, would typically mention being on the river boat or a cowboy.

99
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:27,911
But we're focused on prospecting

100
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:37,390
today. Yes. So so he's talking about digging all kinds of minerals out of all kinds of hard grounds.

101
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,850
And Donald comes in.

102
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:46,360
We got this fun little back ground image of him on that first splash panel warren where he's

103
00:09:46,939 --> 00:10:03,744
Al the money in a bull, or I I really like that. Oh, I I love these old buddy such. They're just grand and you you get to see a little bit of what the top of the money bid might look like as well. But... Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is great. Great poetry by Scrooge there too. It is. All all of his poses are great.

104
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:06,078
And Donald mentions

105
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:14,290
he he he wishes that Scrooge would share some of his secrets because as it turns out, the have a prospecting

106
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,025
trip plan for neck week.

107
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:23,105
And and screw propose, you know, why not take me long

108
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:24,200
but

109
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,240
Donald has kinda learned from experience.

110
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:36,644
And what does he tell us on the next page? Well, Donald says, although, I don't while you log. You'd expect to keep all of everything that we find. And

111
00:10:36,982 --> 00:10:39,654
oh, without me along, you'd likely find nothing.

112
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:41,629
So it's...

113
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:53,329
You know, he he wants Scrooge advice and he wants his ideas, but he does not want him to go along with him. Right. But but Scrooge does cut them what he

114
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:56,243
characterized this a very generous deal

115
00:10:56,861 --> 00:11:02,482
where he would... They would get to keep one dollar out of every hundred dollars worth of minerals.

116
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:04,196
That's that's wonderful.

117
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,755
Donald gets off one of the lines of the

118
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:15,015
stories saying one percent. I can see that you didn't make all of your wealth with a pic and shovel.

119
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:26,304
But you know what Warren, that's a honestly a pretty great deal. Right? Like... Yeah. Because Scrooge is... I mean, he's he's pretty sure I higher. So,

120
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:27,082
you know,

121
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:36,070
one percent of a million bucks is is still something. Yeah. And Donald has a bit of a change of hard. And he is convinced and the boys are now

122
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:47,493
very excited as they jump up well he wants to go anywhere in the world. Yeah, does it really matter where it is. Right. And and this is the big hook of the story. Right? Yeah. Scrooge

123
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:55,225
is so confident in his ability to find well. That he says that he can find some kind of rich minerals

124
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,945
anywhere he happens to be as he leans on a globe and And and... Okay. So the nephews... They call out the title, we get a title on the call. Yeah. Yeah. Which as rich everywhere.

125
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,775
And they get off a great choke. Why not start looking right here?

126
00:12:11,194 --> 00:12:23,080
It's joking that they'll gladly take one percent of the wealth in the bit. I I like that That was was genuinely funny. I thought. It was hit threw me it wasn't oh, that is really clever. You know, Barks had this

127
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:30,270
insight where all the boys have to do say. But, we found it and there it is. They they they're wealthy for the rest of their lives and.

128
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,085
Scrooge know the money bin is out of bounds for prospect.

129
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:41,640
No no more funny remarks. I can almost see Scrooge telling Barks that. I know. And I I love his, like,

130
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,920
expression as he colds them.

131
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Oh, yeah. Put at donald in the background.

132
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:52,972
Right. Donald is genuinely muse. So warren, we we get one of my favorite

133
00:12:53,508 --> 00:13:00,900
adventure tropes here. We get a globe spin. Yeah. I love it. I love it when Tv characters or common characters

134
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,600
spin the globe and randomly points.

135
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:10,785
And and that's again, the hook of the story he'll go anywhere to prospect and his finger

136
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:16,613
lights down on a place away out in the desert of Australia.

137
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:40,651
I'm like he's he's surprised, but come on. Where were you expecting could have been even worse. I was wondering out Scrooge it could've have been... Well, look Al you take the globe spin in like of the North, the the Ducktales Landed in north of Alaska in the in those sea. So no. I think this globe been has actually landed them on land and Australia. It's it it seems realistic to me, but he's like, oh,

138
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,546
he's he's regretting it immediately. Right And I mean

139
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:45,440
australia

140
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:52,372
the expensive of getting there. Maybe that's it. Sure. Sure. But it is famously the side of a couple of gold rashes

141
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:53,264
Sure.

142
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:57,885
And so this is our first time to my knowledge heading

143
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:02,764
returning to Australia. After the early Donald duck venture

144
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:05,018
adventure down under. Yeah. Mh.

145
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:08,370
But but this one we're gonna be in the out outback.

146
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:11,700
Entirely in the outback the whole time,

147
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:15,316
I guess they land at Sydney briefly. But

148
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,930
right they they, you know, they get there, they take a

149
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:33,305
a boat to arrive, and we transition pretty quickly to an out fitter where he gets ready for their trek into the Outback. And warren, why don't you tell us about this kind of unusual

150
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,359
sequence that sets.

151
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:36,997
Yeah. Strangers.

152
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:41,991
This this was this was interesting, again, reading the story for the first time in a long time.

153
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:54,720
Kinda said, okay. Here we go. First of all, the the narrative panel that explains the uncle Scrooge should never brag in front of strangers. And, of course, he's in Sydney. They're strangers everywhere. But we see this sort of

154
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,388
Shadow of two two men who are definitely speaking in an Australian dialect.

155
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:08,783
Hear that bigger I do and I say, bloke make. So just strike. He's the fed Scrooge Actually. So they know who he is. They

156
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,825
converse with each other to tag along after him to see what he can dig up

157
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:30,761
let them find us a fortune to speak a hunter so we know it's bigger and hunter. So as they head of it, it has shades of the beagle boys, but not quite. That's how I kind of saw these two characters. We don't know what they look like though. And then right that's the interesting

158
00:15:31,474 --> 00:15:31,753
Barks

159
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,089
introduction of what

160
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:40,236
could be very villainous this characters here. Right. They're they're definitely coded as very sinister.

161
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:41,069
Yeah.

162
00:15:41,948 --> 00:15:43,927
And and it's very intriguing.

163
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:50,540
And it's interesting because, you know, they are gonna end up not being villainous.

164
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:51,891
Why no.

165
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:52,347
Yeah.

166
00:15:53,104 --> 00:16:06,860
It it's kind of an odd... It's kind of an odd on characters to thing. And I... You know, we we just earlier, we talked about the great steamboat race, which again has this like, add serial conflict

167
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:08,335
against a character

168
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:22,831
who is not a vi. So I find it interesting that he did two of these around the same time that ended up in the in the same issue. Yeah. That's a really good point. And I again maybe it's another way to keep a sixteen page story moving, but

169
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:26,381
but this one took me by surprise because we don't see them for a while.

170
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,500
Right.

171
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:33,505
So so the next sequence is basically gonna be the docs out in the out outback.

172
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:38,509
And and like a lot of these desert set stories, there's gonna be a big

173
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:41,554
preoccupation with water and staying hydrated.

174
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:44,894
You know, you and I had recently covered the seven cities of

175
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:46,834
I

176
00:16:47,334 --> 00:17:08,398
I'm always feeling thirsty on behalf of the characters when I read these stories warren. I always have my water with me because I do do. Yeah. Yeah. No. But they're there they... So such it's an important part of survival in in Barks world that he's Inducks on these adventures and these are the simple things that they can use to survive. And sometimes they they've ignore it. Right

177
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:21,458
And so, you know, basically, I I like this next sequence, but it's it's not all that interest. It's it's really designed to set up. The fact that Scrooge just determined to get out to this

178
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:22,417
location

179
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:24,375
to prove his point

180
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:29,057
and things kinda start to go aw. He accidentally

181
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:34,854
swings into a big part of their water supply damaging, and it can team.

182
00:17:35,713 --> 00:17:48,653
The nephews point out that technically he's missed the site. There's a quick gag about compass is not working half of the the greater is a the pickaxe for a Compass. Yep. Yeah. It's pretty funny.

183
00:17:49,864 --> 00:17:50,364
It.

184
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:56,551
Mh It does move quickly here and and Scrooge the... This rock that

185
00:17:57,168 --> 00:17:58,826
that he strikes

186
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:05,359
and crowns himself ends up being pure lead, which is kind of our first hint of the little...

187
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:15,664
What's the word? Is it just his kind of uncanny ability that we're gonna see later. Yeah. You wanna say luck, but it's probably a little bit more than that with Scrooge

188
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:17,976
yielding the pic because

189
00:18:18,913 --> 00:18:28,610
led is the first level of of mineral that he finds here. Right. And and and, you know, that's classically one of the well anyway. So

190
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:36,153
Donald is really eager that Scrooge has proved as point by finding that and he wants to hike Barks

191
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:37,091
civilization.

192
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,001
But it turns out there in a bit of trouble because of losing that water

193
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:44,769
Yeah. Yeah. When the pickaxe hit to canteen,

194
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:50,929
they're out of water and the nephews on the the the next page or just basically saying we have to refill them And the junior would check

195
00:18:52,106 --> 00:19:07,156
we learned about to read signs that aren't nailed on posts and such as animal tracks and going in a certain direction. So they're they're trying to be resourceful here as Uncle which is kinda coming out of his days here. Right. And and they lead the Ducktales to a water hole. Yeah.

196
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:14,189
And and this is gonna be where we spend much of the rest of this brief story. It's a it's a neat little location.

197
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:16,362
It got, some wildlife,

198
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,397
some ding and kangaroo.

199
00:19:18,815 --> 00:19:29,946
And and the kangaroo are drawn pretty much the same as he drew them back. Can adventure down under pretty much. And and you know, the dots feel a lot better, especially

200
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:30,843
Scrooge

201
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:32,341
with some water

202
00:19:32,734 --> 00:20:02,566
side, you know, it's a safe supply of water. And so he's elected that he's gonna do some real cross expecting. You wanna tell us about the Sequence or this is funny. So in this wild place, we could make a fabulous of strike. He's pretty confident Now, again, that you said refreshed... And he here this this laughing this calling and he turns around and that's enough of your remarks. You k K burrows and he pitches the lead... I believe it's the led that he found earlier.

203
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:04,263
It it.

204
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:20,173
It cuts the trees down the three birds kinda jump up in the air. But he hits this in in in the Graphics book it's kind of a green layer looks like green layer of of rock. And as it crashes into the rocket it reveals a silver

205
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:27,056
vein and that is what He found next is sober right. And and that basically

206
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:33,259
sets the tone worn for a lot of the rest of the story. He's he's is going to

207
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,779
kind of casually

208
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,859
or half hazard

209
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:45,394
uncover a lot of different minerals. Yeah. And And when they set up beside a part of the cliff that is easy digging,

210
00:20:45,815 --> 00:20:46,254
Scrooge

211
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:52,405
instruct Donald to kinda chip off some of the, like, very una assuming stones that he's

212
00:20:52,824 --> 00:21:19,455
dug up and tell us about what Donald finds. Well that finds it that the underneath on the the yellow or that blows, it's uranium. So where he He he says, okay. Well, Sober is okay but we can do better. And now he's discovered uranium is the next stone. Yeah. Sunday stack up this big pile of uranium or which quote is worth more than gold these days and unfortunately, I think that was probably true.

213
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:32,290
There's a fun little bit where the Nephews here. They jump for joy and say, ma'am, and Ser, Scrooge screwed is the greatest prospect or it ever shook a shovel. It's a little corny, but it's fun.

214
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:52,543
And then they have this little... It's called a skin. Right I wasn't sure what that was. And they but they did bring one along because they're prospecting and they wanted to find out what they would find. The Rich. I think we... There's a pretty famous ten pager or with a sent liter too. Was all shit later. Okay. And I think that's yeah. That's fine. Oh, I've always mentally read that. But they're in us

215
00:21:52,920 --> 00:22:00,330
they're look new. Can I ask you were you concerned about the Inducks and their exposure to this uranium? And no. I didn't think of that.

216
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:25,077
I mean, I I looked it up. I I was. Apparently, uranium or is not, like, radioactive to the point where it's gonna... Oh, okay. Good. So So I was worried on their behalf. But apparently, you you can you can hold up some uranium or and be just fine. Alright. To hear that alright. So I'm I'm you know, this is kind of a cheesy bit. Like so the Ducktales

217
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:25,418
gather

218
00:22:25,756 --> 00:22:27,255
this big pile

219
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:31,145
And as they're debating, how to get it back to

220
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:32,143
civilization,

221
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:33,422
they noticed

222
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:46,929
some track leading to this water hole and they and they identify that two men have been camp out. And as you mentioned warren, we haven't really thought about what hunter and dinner in a couple of pages.

223
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:50,169
Yeah. Yeah. And screws is

224
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:57,777
despair that, you know, they've got these claim jumpers to deal with, who are who are a very mean lot.

225
00:22:58,195 --> 00:22:58,434
Mh.

226
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:04,739
And I don't know. This this is, like, I guess it wasn't

227
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,839
maybe this horrible cli at the time,

228
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,171
but I I just can't take this trope serious. Right? Putting anything in a kangaroo pouch.

229
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:22,399
This is the Nephews plan. And then we've seen this in a million pieces of media across the years. Sure.

230
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,239
There's a great bit in the Simpsons,

231
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,039
Warren where one of the

232
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:36,325
homer or and Barks in there go to Australia. So they try to do this. Yeah. Like, yeah. It's a lot stick here than the cartoons show you.

233
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:48,642
Yeah. Well of the simpsons. I love it. Yeah. No. I said it it it is far fetched and... But you gotta get the or out of there or you gotta get the uranium out of there. And, yeah. The nephews

234
00:23:49,018 --> 00:23:50,435
again, tend to have the answer.

235
00:23:50,811 --> 00:24:09,669
Yeah. It's classic cartoon line. If they're they're gonna load up for... They're gonna load up the kangaroo pouches and and, you know, let them take it to wherever they're headed and and when when the older Inducks point out, how how are they gonna get it out that nephews say, well, we're gonna still away in their pal. Right.

236
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:16,904
And I guess they're smaller than, like, the average Huey,. So maybe it's not as unrealistic as all that. I

237
00:24:17,244 --> 00:24:37,677
I had a tough time buying the fact that out of these wild ding and kangaroo that the the the boys are that confident that they've made pets out of most. Oh, yeah. You're right. I've I skipped past that. They've kind of mentioned we've made pets of most of them There's a little bit of hand waving here. It's... Got lot of it. Yeah. This is the ce part of the story.

238
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:47,912
It it works part logic wise. But but I do like this bit one, the part that causes all the trouble. Right? Is that

239
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:50,303
the older Ducktales

240
00:24:50,303 --> 00:24:59,536
observe the kangaroo leaving so that they know which way to to take off and you wanna tell us their their kinda guide... They're way finding

241
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:00,987
Yeah. They're way finding

242
00:25:01,524 --> 00:25:02,981
mechanism are these two

243
00:25:03,358 --> 00:25:09,521
very long looking trees that are standing out. They're definitely in the path of the of the departing Kangaroo

244
00:25:09,914 --> 00:25:10,414
So

245
00:25:10,913 --> 00:25:27,992
he's hoping that those two threes they they stand in the line, and that will be easy to remember. Is in the morning, Al we have to do is we'll pass those two trays and keep moving. We can't miss that then we see the two trees stand up, and this is where immediately say, okay. This is gotta be bigger and hunter. Right?

246
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:34,736
Because they start talking to each other. Yeah, that the base glow like they swallow Jack enter. And so they know they've got something

247
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:40,813
but they still are kind of ominous figures here. So what do they do? Well, they decide to look like...

248
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:49,958
I think innocently trying to find out where they went. I don't know and this is what kinda confused me, Mark. I wasn't quite sure if they were intentionally

249
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:51,433
repositioning

250
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,270
to

251
00:25:52,607 --> 00:26:00,893
to screw up Scrooge. I don't think so. No. They they don't know that they're... That the trees are Barks They

252
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:11,006
and everything out. The only thing they don't know is exactly where his quote glory is. They don't Know the exact location

253
00:26:11,344 --> 00:26:23,713
of the uranium mine and they want to get a better glimpse of it and and at this point, we think they wanna jump the claim. But, of course, we're gonna learn later that they're just trying to state their own yeah

254
00:26:24,091 --> 00:26:24,591
legitimately.

255
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:35,553
Yeah. Yeah. We've got to locate his digging and we don't dare go into his camp snoop around. He could plot us. I didn't know what that meant got us, or did they mean spot? I I

256
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:43,779
I... It must be an Australian term. I yeah. I... I'm I imagine that my reference like a pot shot, but maybe it is us

257
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:44,679
pacific

258
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:58,714
Al slam. He calls them the the tree blinds then to a different location because that's what they intended it to be. Right. But anyways, so So, yeah, they they move just to get their... To get a better view. And of of course,

259
00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:02,685
this causes Inducks to, like, doubt their sanity.

260
00:27:03,102 --> 00:27:03,602
And

261
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:18,226
as they wake up in the morning, they're kinda standing there and they they end up going the totally wrong way. They head out to the... They they don't go south as they should. And as they walk past the tree blinds,

262
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:21,075
one of the So called claim jumpers

263
00:27:21,491 --> 00:27:26,990
has, like, a question mark balloon. Yeah. Wondering, you know, why they've gone off in a different direction.

264
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,140
Yeah. So they

265
00:27:29,637 --> 00:27:30,336
looks like

266
00:27:30,753 --> 00:27:40,649
the the Nephews have camped out now. They've made it to a destination, but they can't find donald and Scrooge they they haul they call out to them. Right. Because they've returned

267
00:27:41,469 --> 00:27:45,049
they've returned. Yeah. And that's when we start hearing again, these

268
00:27:45,484 --> 00:27:52,204
from these two men. Now I'll be honest with you, Mark. When I saw these two men, there's no tree they're not in Silhouette.

269
00:27:53,098 --> 00:28:13,169
It took me a while to kinda say, oh, these are those guys. Maybe them just slow slow on this story, but it took me a while to thread it all together it... That not too long. Maybe a couple of panels in. But It's it's a very jarring. Right? Yeah I guess that's why I'm saying it. It'd be it they that's not at all, like the silhouette seams that we saw earlier.

270
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:21,062
Right. So Barks has done all this coding. Right? Very overt. He's used all these, like, very specific storytelling

271
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:28,254
techniques like showing them in silhouette, not not letting us see them showing them whispering and skull king Every

272
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,410
storytelling

273
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:39,485
indication that he's used is that these guys are bad news. Right. And then, as you say when they show up they're looking very baby face

274
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:41,454
very jane,

275
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:46,036
and they just saw to write up and introduce themselves as prospect

276
00:28:46,373 --> 00:29:15,097
that just state to claim and and it it is jarring. And like, I will say I I don't think it really works. No I don't either. And I wanted because the editors maybe gotten this one or Barks just decided to to do it but it it's very... I don't think this is any kind of editorial interference, you know? Because, like, through the rest of the story, they are the point I think there's a little bit of a jump don't judge a book by its cover except it's like on the readers.

277
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:24,104
But I will say I don't think it's as much as I enjoy this story, I don't think this little turn is that six successful because there's no interaction

278
00:29:24,564 --> 00:29:25,504
between the characters,

279
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:29,064
there... It's it is it's weird

280
00:29:29,378 --> 00:29:38,331
and it it doesn't match like, the usual storytelling rhythm that you would expect from this. So I I suspect that a lot of other people

281
00:29:38,683 --> 00:29:41,855
have probably found this jarring and confusing.

282
00:29:42,471 --> 00:29:43,508
Because of that coding?

283
00:29:44,345 --> 00:29:47,654
Yeah. I don't feel alone then, but and it wasn't until the last panel of that page.

284
00:29:48,786 --> 00:30:17,505
That we really understand when he uses the word... The name dick. So we go all, okay. These are those two because the the baby faced nature of them, the the sweater, the the what they're wearing and it and they're pleasant. They're those are like some of the friend looking characters the Barks has ever draw. So does it work for me? Man, it it threw me off. Let's put it that way. Yeah. I I definitely... So I think that if this story had another six to eight pages.

285
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:23,168
Yeah. It probably could have made for, like, a good sort of reveal or turn

286
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,919
and I still really like this story. But I I... It is jarring.

287
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,274
But but I like their role and the rest of this story. Right? The

288
00:30:33,694 --> 00:30:38,514
they're gonna they're gonna kind of figure out oh no. We've inadvertently

289
00:30:39,628 --> 00:31:06,704
you know, the the the, the Nephews mentioned that how can our uncles have gotten lost, All they had to do was walk and align with those trees. And, you know, even here the story is so short that it's missing the panel that I feel like it needs where the Nephew turns around. And goes, hey, those trees were right there. Where you know, everything is just a little bit compressed. Yeah. But basically,

290
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:11,864
did earn hunter figure out that they've inadvertently caused this disaster

291
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:23,954
And now they have to go off. They all have to go off and try and rescue the docks. And and and we lose they lose their trail and a desert sands

292
00:31:24,294 --> 00:31:36,394
storm. And so the rest have to like, fan out and and call out for them but but now we come into the sequence of the story that it is my favorite, and that I think is

293
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:37,272
extremely

294
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:51,895
successful. More. Yeah. This. Yeah. This is where the they start looking for water. Right. Because Donald screws don't have enough water. They had counted on meeting the boys much quicker than they than they are.

295
00:31:52,631 --> 00:31:53,928
So after

296
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:55,580
a hot night,

297
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:15,024
into a hot day, Scrooge is digging, looking for water. And this is... This is the magic hour hourglass. Sequence. Right? It almost... It it almost mirrors it beautifully. Yeah. Where it right. Discover that the first strike is gold, biggest nuggets I ever saw

298
00:32:15,564 --> 00:32:22,984
You looks sent them for Alarm. Oh, you can't drink, go. Look at that look on Donald face eyes have closed just desperate

299
00:32:23,684 --> 00:32:24,644
on the luck.

300
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:30,759
Dot god the luck. So he toss it. Right? So It's it's a little bit different

301
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:31,839
than

302
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:32,839
magic

303
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:37,726
glass just because it doesn't have kind of that moral realistic element. That's.

304
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:45,679
But you still have these Ducktales who are desperate for water and and Scrooge like un uncanny

305
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:48,839
is basically kicking in here. And

306
00:32:49,579 --> 00:32:52,679
we're gonna get this sequence that where it's repeated

307
00:32:53,114 --> 00:32:53,614
where

308
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,290
every time he digs a

309
00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:01,138
quote mine looking for water, it's gonna end up first, it's copper,

310
00:33:01,595 --> 00:33:09,511
which would render the water un dr if even if it was there, And then well we're on. But then they look... They dig into something

311
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:13,574
into clay and they see something shining like ice, but it's diamonds.

312
00:33:13,973 --> 00:33:16,127
And again, it it just keeps going.

313
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:17,226
Donald.

314
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:29,029
It's just is plastic there. And then the narrative box for the next three or four panels is another dry hole. And another So after diamonds, it's platinum

315
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:31,383
than nickel than ten.

316
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,277
And and Barks

317
00:33:33,996 --> 00:33:34,496
accelerate

318
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:38,106
Yeah. The. Right? It it takes

319
00:33:38,764 --> 00:33:40,942
two panels to find the copper

320
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:51,868
and then the diamonds. And then each Each subsequent one gets one panel and Bark keeps it varied and interesting. Right? This is his genius. He does. Yeah.

321
00:33:53,027 --> 00:34:00,414
And and, you know, but when once we get bored of this we switch gears what well, before we get bored of of this

322
00:34:01,113 --> 00:34:15,121
sort of gag. We switched gears and Donald is like, hey, you are the problem. You you bring this bad luck finding well. So he blind folds him. And Dawn I'll just gonna hit the next spot. That's a nice story took her here. Nice.

323
00:34:15,714 --> 00:34:19,394
And then even while blind folded warren, what what happens?

324
00:34:19,754 --> 00:34:19,834
Well,

325
00:34:20,634 --> 00:34:22,509
Scrooge uncanny ability as a

326
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:23,949
is even

327
00:34:24,249 --> 00:34:28,749
elevated with his ability to listen now what? He says I can hear something ge

328
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:35,759
underwater or the underground, it's water. Sure enough. I hear it too. So they both have their heads to the ground and they say start striking

329
00:34:36,377 --> 00:34:40,885
and not admitted to soon, and they're both look at static that you see the kids and the

330
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:44,594
coming over the... Right. It's it's a perfect

331
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:48,600
transition. We're not gonna see them discover. That water. Yeah.

332
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:54,714
We we... The story is gonna wrap up and the one of the nephews,

333
00:34:55,214 --> 00:34:57,154
Dewey is gonna find them

334
00:34:57,894 --> 00:35:08,548
and and it's just in the nick of time, he's able to give him a drink of what what the older dots are excited to realize is orange shoes. Have where'd to get that.

335
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:11,338
Yeah. Because they've been the civilization.

336
00:35:11,874 --> 00:35:16,597
He says we got it from a store in the town where the kangaroo left took us.

337
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:37,969
Warren this this this is like pitch perfect. Here. I'm just gonna read I'm just gonna read it as written. And the man and the man at the asset office where we left the oa said, you must be the greatest prospect that ever lived and a be drag Donald domestically says, there's no doubt about that, dewey. Look at what he finds.

338
00:35:38,544 --> 00:35:40,524
Blind folded even. A

339
00:35:40,984 --> 00:35:42,724
confounded oil well.

340
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:44,764
We see the gi

341
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:50,208
that liquid turning out to, of course, not be water and a totally should

342
00:35:50,586 --> 00:36:40,208
embarrassed looking sp. And you got the pick pickaxe on one side of the the ge pool and you've got his top hat on the other side. It's really a nicely framed piece of art right there. I think. Yeah. But I love that. I think the think it's it's very poetic. It's it doesn't reach the heights again of the magic hour hourglass the degradation that they're going through and that, but the steaks are a little bit lower too. And tell us how how I wraps up one Well, they they they've got... They they were able to drink the orange juice and they're they're refreshed, but so Al well that ends well, the ducks and their prospect friends, now their friends hike back to safety. I love with Donald here after boys. Well never again ask uncle Scrooge, How he made his money. We won't donald. It's just it's great. Right.

343
00:36:40,786 --> 00:36:44,323
Yeah. I like that closing line. He might wanna go prospecting.

344
00:36:44,742 --> 00:36:49,942
And if he does tell him we won't go, not even for one percent of what he can find.

345
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:52,951
This a great ending.

346
00:36:53,686 --> 00:37:02,053
Again, and shades of magic glass, but not so much. I just love the... I think my favorite page had to be that that where they discovered all those

347
00:37:02,843 --> 00:37:19,481
for nickel to tip to aluminum and donald saying you're slipping uncle screws. I mean, That's just classic. Yeah. I I think that's un question the best part. And and it's it's the point of the story. Right? It's... I think this is probably one of those stories that he kind of wrote backwards. Right? Like,

348
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:37,044
maybe he was even thinking about magic hour hourglass and that great sequence. I I mean, he should rightfully be proud of it Like, magic glass is not one of my all time favorites, but I I do think that that ending is as good as anything he's ever done.

349
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:41,444
And so, you know, now he's got Scrooge as more as something

350
00:37:41,904 --> 00:38:02,289
a little different and wouldn't it be funny if Scrooge were looking for water desperately, but all he could, you know, Donald is encountering found riches in that one. But now Scrooge is mining for richards. Right. Right. So I mean, we we acknowledge that this one is an uneven story.

351
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:05,203
It it even has a couple of issues,

352
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:16,864
but I I also just I really enjoy it. Maybe it's a nostalgic favor for me. I even like the the... That weird aspect where they turn out to be nice guys.

353
00:38:17,864 --> 00:38:18,844
The prospect

354
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:36,195
I just wish he had gotten to kinda develop it better over the course of, yeah, a few more pages made. I totally agree. I like the fact that they're good guys. I like the fact that they're helping the nephews and and helping donald and Scrooge. I'd like the fact that they kinda disappear at the end of the story.

355
00:38:36,768 --> 00:38:40,462
And donald Scrooge take over, which makes sense because you've gotta a wrap it.

356
00:38:41,000 --> 00:39:16,214
But was jarring. I think that's the best thing you could say it just threw me off, and I I didn't care for that as much. But I I if I think back to Barks and but I can only imagine him saying that this is just a vehicle. So a vehicle to get from point eight to point b, and we don't have time for a lot of dillon and stealing. So let's just make sure they're good guys, they're gonna be helpful and get to that ending. So I... Yeah. I don't know. It's about the only thing I can arise here. Yeah. I mean, the point of this one the meat of this one is the comme sequence at the end and it is

357
00:39:16,873 --> 00:39:21,064
kind of establishing Scrooge screws is this over the top rate prospect.

358
00:39:21,563 --> 00:39:22,503
Yeah. So

359
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:29,448
so let's talk about, you know, the with the community and and how they feel about this one.

360
00:39:30,603 --> 00:39:32,975
Four for a pretty early

361
00:39:33,312 --> 00:39:36,140
screws story. You know, we're still in uncle Scrooge.

362
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:43,380
Number eleven. This one's not really that highly disregard. It gets a seven point four on Inducks

363
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,960
which, of course is the the site where anyone can create an account and vote on the stories.

364
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,707
That's good for number three hundred for number three hundred and sixty six out of all forty two some thousand

365
00:39:57,405 --> 00:39:57,845
stories.

366
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:07,492
So, you know, it's it's not the highest for an early uncle Scrooge Barks story but compared to other non Barks It's still still very well.

367
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:10,322
Kind of considering it against the other

368
00:40:11,018 --> 00:40:11,536
Scrooge

369
00:40:12,055 --> 00:40:21,161
stories or the other Barks adventure stories this one is just kind of like a a typical average Barks story. Okay.

370
00:40:21,998 --> 00:40:25,704
This is at the low end of that kind of those kind of average

371
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:27,183
bark stories.

372
00:40:27,602 --> 00:40:30,380
You know, this one didn't really have anything

373
00:40:31,038 --> 00:40:37,427
It's it's it's like a snack not a full meal. Right? So he didn't he never

374
00:40:37,805 --> 00:40:41,880
revisited this for, like, an oil painting or Al lit or anything like that.

375
00:40:42,613 --> 00:40:45,364
But Would say it's a big kind of, like,

376
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:46,861
inspiring

377
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,288
or a a a guides stone for what the care... Who the character

378
00:40:51,665 --> 00:41:00,225
is. Going down the road. And then just, you know, by the nature of what this story is, there's not really been any kind of a sequel that I'm aware of

379
00:41:00,763 --> 00:41:03,734
or any kind of a follow. So any

380
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:31,222
final thoughts or favorite panels that you'd like to highlight lauren? First of all, I think the book is... The this story is book ended by three opening great pages and closes with three great pages. I know that's I don't wanna say that the the the central part of the story isn't is great but I don't think it's as memorable. I love I love the opening splash panel. It's just another great money been shot in Scrooge.

381
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:33,055
Confidence and his

382
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:37,443
you know, opening statement about being the clever prospect that ever lived

383
00:41:37,781 --> 00:41:48,186
or picked under a pebble. I think that's great. I love the globe spin and that that trope that you you see often and where he lands and then it takes us into

384
00:41:48,563 --> 00:41:51,057
the middle part of the story. But then the ending

385
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,852
wandering wondering through the desert

386
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:55,819
striking all of these minerals and

387
00:41:56,636 --> 00:42:00,700
to me is is the is the the the last three pages are just classic

388
00:42:01,718 --> 00:42:10,935
that's what I'm gonna say. Yeah. I think that your point about how it's kind of book ended by greatness is very fair. Got kind of a weak middle.

389
00:42:11,515 --> 00:42:19,628
But, yeah, great opening is closing. And you you hit some pretty good panels there for me, the the winners are basically,

390
00:42:20,244 --> 00:42:27,461
you know, once we're at the end of the story and donald and Scrooge are on their own desperately digging for water.

391
00:42:27,914 --> 00:42:34,779
All of those reaction faces that they make are are just the best. I especially, like Scrooge

392
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:45,261
embarrassed grim. As the oil Al is for revealed. I think that one is the a confounded oil well panel is is is fantastic. I also love Barks

393
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:48,375
detail on just,

394
00:42:48,955 --> 00:42:51,375
you know, going through the wind and the sand.

395
00:42:51,715 --> 00:43:07,022
He does a really nice job with with the forms of of duct of the Ducktales as they as they, you know, are venturing off into the desert. Really Yeah. Sorry yeah. The outback looks really nice. Maybe not quite as nice as an

396
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:16,000
adventure down under, but it's for nice. But... Yeah. Excellent. Well, thank you for joining me on this B one warren.

397
00:43:16,575 --> 00:43:20,555
These. I really appreciate it. It was fun. It was fun to revisit

398
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:27,402
the story. I I don't have the memory of it that I have maybe some of the other stories, but there were some some

399
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:40,347
reminders of of other stories in here, like You said, we talked about the magic hour hourglass and the globe spinning from my favorite like of the North. I I kinda love that. So it was great to revisit this again into

400
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:47,615
to work it a... Work through it with you. Thank you. Bye. Well, I hope listeners will join us again next

401
00:43:48,352 --> 00:43:53,038
episode should be a very fun one. Get to cover the golden fleece.

402
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:58,715
Which should be very easy to talk about. And check us out on our socials,

403
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:00,671

and Instagram. And, you know, I already mentioned

405
00:44:04,855 --> 00:44:10,548
I already covered that last bit of dialogue, so that's it from us, and we'll see you next time.
