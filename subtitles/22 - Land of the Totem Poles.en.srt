publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome back to Barks remark I'm Mark Sever, a grown man who enjoys donald duck comics.

3
00:00:55,593 --> 00:01:11,500
I've got a new first time guest host who is joining me to talk about the famous Barks story land of the tote poles. Guess host, if you could please introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about your background

4
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,420
and

5
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,920
experience with comics.

6
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:50,540
Hi. This is Susan Bailey. Hi, Barks, Thanks. I'm really happy to be here. I'm excited. I've been hearing a lot about Barks remarks for my husband who is another guest guest host on this this podcast. I never really read Comics as a kid. There was still that stigma but it didn't count as reading in an academic sense and I was very goody two shoes doing exactly what my teacher said. So I read I read books with no pictures, because that's what big girls at. And so I I kinda came him in the comics later, my husband as I said it's very much in comics and they're a big background

7
00:01:50,916 --> 00:02:02,070
in in our life and I I've read a few that I really enjoy, but this was my first time with the Carl Barks awesome. Yeah. First first experience with one of the the Disney comics, the Ducktales comics.

8
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:07,863
Your husband, of course is is Ryan Bailey, one of our more prolific

9
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,818
guest host, but I'm I'm very excited to get your perspective for this one too

10
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:16,247
because you I know you've got a bit of a creative writing background.

11
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:17,124
And,

12
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:37,310
you know, this one, this is a little bit of a challenging story for me. The because... I mean, it's in the title. Right? Land of the tote pulls and the fact that this is from nineteen forty nine should clue listeners in that, you know, we're gonna be talking a little bit about the treatment of the the first nations people and this.

13
00:02:38,323 --> 00:03:09,354
Little disclaimer. You know, Neither of us were not like, first nations were not of this northwest tribe. I I felt like it would be a little bit phony to try and find you know, some some random person from the Pacific Northwest to try and account for this because, you know, i I like to talk to people that I know or have a background duck comics. But it's important to consider, I think the depictions in this. And so while we're not, like representatives of these civic Northwest first nations people. I know you you grew up your, like

14
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:25,235
near a lot of native Americans your reservation. Right? I did. Yeah. I grew up next to the Navajo reservation. And so I I don't speak for them, but I I can tell. I can tell you with no uncertainty that this this would be problematic for them. Yeah. Absolutely.

15
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:33,074
So there's kind of a careful balance with these. Right? Because Carl Barks fans, you know, Barks did the majority of these in the nineteen

16
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,545
forties and fifties and into the sixties.

17
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:38,030
And society obviously had

18
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:44,810
a different idea. So I always say, you know, it's it's unfair to hold people to the standards,

19
00:03:45,345 --> 00:03:45,845
of

20
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:58,620
twenty twenty one. But at the same time, we do have to recognize that it's not that it wasn't wrong. It's it's that we didn't know better and just because all of society was engaging in these stereotypes doesn't mean we can't

21
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,860
recognize what's wrong. At the same time, there are, like some weird traces

22
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:09,014
of of of the representation that he does in this one that that is a little more accurate

23
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:17,125
than you might expect. And we'll we'll talk a little bit about, you know the background. But but again, it's important to know we

24
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:18,442
were in Arizona

25
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:20,451
for a time. And

26
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:32,273
again, you know, the the main native culture there is Navajo in that area. And so again, I'm not trying to speak for, like the first nations people. It's I don't want to commit the sin that so many people

27
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:37,480
do when creating pop culture and media that shows native Americans.

28
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:40,115
Right? And and and that is to basically

29
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:43,315
act like they're all the same.

30
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:44,235
Right?

31
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:49,160
The the people of the Pacific northwest have a very distinct culture.

32
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:50,355
Even

33
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:52,166
within specific tribes,

34
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:53,675
they're are very.

35
00:04:54,094 --> 00:05:04,508
You know I I looked a little bit into tote pulls for this one, which to me is the the fascinating hook of this one and there are incredibly distinct styles and cultural

36
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:07,065
representations of of tote pulls,

37
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:11,380
you know, certain certain tribes will use different

38
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:22,931
creatures when they are creating their tote poles, for example. Sue, do you know much about tote and poles? I I know absolutely not thing about total pulls. I I really... That's not something

39
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:27,238
that is really obvious in any of the, like, peripheral

40
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:34,485
experience that I have with native cultures. Right. Right. And there'd be no reason for you too.

41
00:05:35,145 --> 00:05:56,105
And and I didn't either, but I... But I looked... I learned a little bit about it. Before intending to cover this comic and and they're really interesting. Right? Because they they kind of tell a tribe history. I I find it interesting that there's kind of a mis number. You know, we have that saying like the low man on the tote pole. Apparently, that's kind of backwards. Usually the the lower

42
00:05:57,001 --> 00:06:07,214
representation on the tote pole is is is more important. That was... That was something... Yeah. That I I thought was interesting that I learned. I don't wanna go too deeply into it, but,

43
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:19,856
you know, I I did learn that tote pulls kind of they do range in the area that the ducks are gonna go to in this story. They actually were used by first Nations people ranging from the very southern tip of Alaska

44
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:23,344
down into the very very northern tip of California.

45
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:33,259
Again, they're very different depending on, you know, what tribe is creating them. They're they're made generally from Cedar wood and

46
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:42,311
they were radically affected by like the arrival of Americans. Right? Because that that brought tools that would allow people who made tote

47
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,426
to make them much larger. Oh, there's an alternate name too. They're sometimes called monumental.

48
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:55,132
Polls. For for a time, tote poles were being, like, either destroyed or taken away

49
00:06:55,563 --> 00:07:02,719
by people who wanted to really stamp out indigenous culture. And there's been this big, like fascinating rep

50
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:03,529
movement

51
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:11,191
I would love to to go more into the history of tote polls, but I I guess my perspective is that the these

52
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:13,083
are very important

53
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:15,361
right, to the native peoples

54
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,115
And this story, unfortunately is gonna to treat them as as more of a narrative

55
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:25,617
Yeah. No. When when I got to that page, and I we'll talk about it more. I was like, oh,

56
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:28,551
okay. That's not what I thought was going

57
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:32,919
Hi. And I think it's kind of gonna be a case of backwards storytelling.

58
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,768
You know, I I just did an episode with my wife that was

59
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:42,385
really fun where Donald and sc get involved in this fight

60
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:55,398
with steam shovel. Right? Like, they're duke it out in steam shovel. And and I I theorized that Barks, you know, he had that panel in mind where he really wanted to create a steam shovel any kind of backwards

61
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:59,284
engineer the story around it. And and I think that he

62
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:04,975
he wanted to do the same here. Right? He had an idea of that panel that we'll we'll get into.

63
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:35,825
So I don't wanna take too long before getting into the actual story. Let's talk about a little bit of the kind of the background of of land of the tote poles. This one is one of our last stories that's in the forties. Right? This was... Had to cover date of December nineteen forty nine. Was published in the old one shot series four color number, two hundred and sixty three And and I'm sue I've been tracking how many time stories have been reprinted. This one has not been reprinted as as often

64
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:43,990
as many of the other stories. I suspect because it it is problematic. Right? That does not the surprise made. Yeah. It's only had six

65
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,110
reprint

66
00:08:45,690 --> 00:09:09,379
in the United States at least. And it is a little shorter than many of the adventure length stories. This one's a twenty four pager If I had to create a synapse for this, I would say that you, this is about donald blu his way into a sales job in the northern forests of the Pacific Northwest. Let's see a little little bit of background trivia about the story itself and and the creation.

67
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:10,378
So Sue,

68
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:31,030
Barks did so many of these stories. That, you know, and he kind of toil anonymously for much of his career. So he kind of felt sometimes like, he could go back to the same well. And he would reuse some of his story beats. And so this this is a story that he kind of re adapted again a decade or so later in

69
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:43,826
a story called city of Golden Roofs. And I I think I read that one before. I read this one and I actually enjoy... I think I enjoy that one a little bit more than this one. It has its own problematic

70
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:47,249
stuff. As you might imagine, but I don't think it's quite as Al

71
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:52,305
eyebrow raising. And then, you know, Don been a salesman a couple of times.

72
00:09:53,123 --> 00:10:13,502
There's a ten pager story called salesman Mcdonald's. So that's an interesting hook for this one. And I find it interesting that you know, Carl Marx had this career where he did all these like, globe spanning stories he himself didn't really do much travel until much later in life. And one of his only documented vacations actually is in the Pacific

73
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:22,705
northwest. And so he got a lot of inspiration for this story from the from the vacation that he took and and he was actually referencing

74
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:36,089
some of the, I think the the native artifacts that he saw and some of the scenery, You know, the lo cows that he saw. And and sue, I don't know if you got the impression that it was created from a reference.

75
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:39,625
When I when I was looking at their their their travel specifically,

76
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:55,006
it made... It made me feel very like, it it was very grounded. Like, this is something that could happen. This is something that probably did happen a lot where they're where's the road? You know what I mean? And I think right up until they get to the Native village,

77
00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:03,631
it feels like, yeah. Maybe maybe he was there maybe he saw this this kind of scenery this kind of attitude of, like, there's no road mister.

78
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:10,565
Very interesting. Yeah. Yeah. The only the only travel that he did early on was, like just down into the border,

79
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:13,635
you know, the California Mexico burger.

80
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:14,788
And then

81
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:19,586
and then this northwest vacation. So it's interesting because you get this, like,

82
00:11:20,383 --> 00:11:20,883
visually

83
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:46,794
when we get to it, we'll see. But the the native village actually looks very lovingly rendered. And if you just look at it visually, I think it's a very good depiction. Right? Because, like, it shows these long houses. And I and I think there's I wanna say there's fish drying, You know, it kinda shows this, like, everyday life. The way the natives... The first nations people like interact and talk is more in keeping with that like, hollywood

84
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:49,227
trope of the the savage

85
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:50,419
Indian.

86
00:11:50,899 --> 00:12:06,494
I'm not gonna, like, repeat that word, but but it's important much, but it's important to say, you know, that's that's how they're gonna be referred to in this one a lot. And I don't know about you too. I'm I'm a little bit older than you and I grew up watching a lot of like Nick at night and

87
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:08,535
nineteen fifties Tv.

88
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:12,709
And and it's important to say that, like this was the widespread

89
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:18,803
depiction of native peoples at this time. They were they were treated Al story book characters

90
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:25,339
I would say, there was never really an acknowledgment that natives are real people that you could actually

91
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:34,294
meet. Like, that that experience is completely foreign to me. I didn't watch a lot of Tv as a kid. And since I grew up with natives, my first

92
00:12:34,753 --> 00:13:04,228
encounters with problematic media, depicting natives were like, let's like, why are they doing this? It does it didn't make any sense to me. The first time I I saw it. And then as I got older, I realized how widespread spread. It was. Yeah. No. It was it was a bit of a shock to me the first time because again, I knew native people before I knew media representations of native people. That's really interest I must have been really striking to see some of those. I do remember, I do remember

93
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:11,554
speaking with some some of my friends about it. And, like, you know, you got you've gotta to dig deep if you want real

94
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:26,022
representation of of native culture like sherman and Alex alexa right beautiful novels. And those are those are real depictions where they're real people whereas, you know, in Hollywood probably up until the eighties, they were just characters.

95
00:13:26,494 --> 00:13:29,586
Per they needed a canned bad guy or they needed

96
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,819
somebody to make the white man look smart.

97
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:51,984
Right. Or like, the noble savage trope. Oh, yeah. That one. That one that one was probably popular even longer because it feels less problematic probably to the story creators, but but it's not Yeah. That that's that's a great point. Right? Like, that was what we started to see, I think into the eighties where we could pat ourselves on the back.

98
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:56,854
Right. But it it's still... It was still a trope. Just a little more background.

99
00:13:57,193 --> 00:14:07,905
This was published in the same issue as our story from the next episode the trail of the unicorn, that was not very common. And then Barks actually listed this one frequently as one of his favorites.

100
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,019
Saying that he really enjoyed the multiple elements.

101
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:18,827
And this really is kind of this hodgepodge of different concepts that he's gonna bring into And then this this is something that Barks did

102
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:26,819
occasionally early on. The the first nations people in this are actually drawn as humans rather than the kind of dog

103
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:33,350
that he'll use later for, like, generic background characters. You know, that kind of Disney dog knows.

104
00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:36,920
Representation that. And that was an editorial Ducktales.

105
00:14:37,040 --> 00:15:03,309
Titles from around the world so, I didn't I didn't prep you for this So let me just run down a couple of these really quickly and we'll get into it I like to share some of the alternate titles unless do you want me to put a couple in the chat for you to say? No. You go... You go ahead. I'm I'm curious about this. Most of the publications from around the world have used the original title, you know, land of the tote poles or something like that in their native language. In Brazil it was Ata d

106
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,289
At the land of the idol. In Denmark, It was tote

107
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:08,169
hall

108
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:11,264
land, Tote Polls land. France was,

109
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:17,464
Don Land of Tote. But a couple interesting ones. Germany

110
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:19,438
called it the math

111
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:25,466
the power of sounds for one publication. And in the Netherlands, it was bet

112
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:26,903
Tote.

113
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:31,554
Which Google translate tells me hon tote.

114
00:15:33,574 --> 00:15:44,760
I think that's the perfect title. Also, I'm really glad that I didn't have you send those over to the chat because I would've have butcher those. Yeah. I'm I'm sure I butcher you're them pretty good. But but I have fun pretending, I didn't.

115
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:52,465
Alright. So I got a little bit of more like, historical and geographical stuff to talk about, but I'll kind of embed it into the

116
00:15:52,939 --> 00:16:00,741
the story itself. You ready to to talk about this one too? Yeah. Let's jump in. So Land the tote poles opens

117
00:16:01,414 --> 00:16:05,510
with a kind of a very dated concept. Right? Donald is

118
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:18,461
reading the newspaper, and he's looking at a job class Al classified ad that's published, seeking super salesman to sell a high priced gizmo and the job offers

119
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:20,154
huge commissions.

120
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:21,035
And,

121
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:44,365
you know, he he rushes. He's very excited about this salesman job and he rushes to the place where he can interview to see that there's a line of people waiting to do the same. And he's gonna use this old trick to get himself into the head of the line. He's gonna bundle up a bunch of newspapers and blessed her his way in and acting like he's got a very important package.

122
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:58,115
And and I'm curious when you think about this open or sue, but this is really interesting to me because this feels this feels incredibly date right? The idea of a door to door salesman job and being excited about that. I I thought it was delightful...

123
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:03,967
Some of the other comics that you that you had me read. I was looking at, like, seems like Donald is always trying to make a Quick.

124
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:04,847
Yeah.

125
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:13,653
And so the fact that he would be excited about this seems right in character and I just love the the like, tricky plays to to get into

126
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:20,605
get into the office where pushing people aside oh, I've got a very important package. Very important package. But I think my favorite

127
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:31,784
favorite bit of this page is the very last panel where he's climbing over the applicant. And the and the guy is like, leaning forward, and there's just Al little sign on his desk that says, I'm him

128
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:38,524
exclamation point. Yeah. It's it's... This one, this page is like packed with really great background gag.

129
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:49,362
And well constructed little funny elements. You know, he's going to forty four forty four forty fourth Street. He he runs past this like, classic depiction of a tram h.

130
00:17:50,501 --> 00:18:05,993
It's it's very dated, but it's very funny. And then, you know, he that little gag you mentioned was preceded by him saying important package for the manager. One side one side, and then the sign seems to be referencing that. So, you know, it's it's very visual. This is a podcast.

131
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:29,363
So, like, one of the worst things you can do is say, oh, look at these funny elements and appreciate them. But but really, this this is a great. Page it's... I think it's a very strong opening. Then I I like the very Barks like sales manager. You know. He again, feels like this very classic typo technology. Donald successfully blessed his way in and he reveals his and and, you know, predictably,

132
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:53,339
the guy is really annoyed. At Donald, this doesn't seem to be the best way to make an impression. He says you suck me with the oldest gang in the book. Donald stave him off with a coat rack while telling him. You know, I'm I'm showing you some initiative. I'm a super salesman You need me. And, you know, the guy the guy considers it, and you can see him...

133
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:53,839
I mean,

134
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:07,892
sue, do you mind telling me your impression of of what I think is very visible to the reader. It's not trying to show that he's considering his idea. I think he's got this like, curling smile and these like pointed eyebrows, anything.

135
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:13,099
I feel like he is he's realizing oh, I can use this sucker.

136
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,059
Right.

137
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:18,989
Yeah. He's he's deciding he's gonna give him the work. Says you would have said back then.

138
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:25,087
And and he he says this overt. He says you're just the kind of guy I'd like to see get the business.

139
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:29,051
So he's gonna set Donald up. Right? Because

140
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:33,201
he tells him he's got this. He he says that it's Al lucrative.

141
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:42,759
Block of territory up north. And he swallows the line about what the actual sales item is. He says, how do you like to sell our

142
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:43,799
product?

143
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:50,732
And and he he references a sales contest. You know, Donald is is very confident in this full of blu.

144
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:53,049
And so he pretty much agrees

145
00:19:53,388 --> 00:20:28,174
sign on scene. I just I just love how like, the guy swallows it in the first line, but then it looks like, you know, you'll have a chance of the grand prize, which goes to the s, which sells the most and honestly like, I'm sure to win that all one myself. He almost had the opportunity there to figure out what it was that he was selling but he just doesn't care. Right. He he blessed his way into this problem. So on the next page, on the third page, you know, he he gets home and he tells the boys to pack their bags their heading up north for his new salesman job, and he tells them that it's gonna be on the kick me quick river,

146
00:20:28,514 --> 00:20:30,389
which is Al pretty flip

147
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:46,489
geographical name. But i admittedly, it sounds like something that could be in the Pacific Northwest. And so he doesn't even know where it is. He has the kids look up on the map and they find that it is up in the wildest country there is and and they're kind of pointing to the border between Al last

148
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:55,243
in Northwest Canada. So we kind of figure out that this is either in the Yukon territory or the northern part of British Columbia. And when the nephews...

149
00:20:55,981 --> 00:21:09,034
Do you mind telling us sue when... What what Donald says when the Nephews asked about what he's selling I love I love this because he he's obviously not even thinking about it He's like some kind of pressure cooker, I think. And he's like trying to

150
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:24,534
squeeze everything that he can into this giant suitcase that's bigger than he is. He still doesn't know what he's selling. He's packing his Barks. He still doesn't nobody he's selling, but it's gonna be fine. Yeah. And you can kinda tell that the the sales boss must have kind of

151
00:21:25,313 --> 00:21:35,089
talked his way around what it is. It it obviously has something to do with steam. And and so the nephews, you know, they consider, hey, if we're up there we might as well

152
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:48,015
try and sell something too. So they decide to get a get a line of goods And you know, this is a pretty common setup for this kind of story where the nephews will be in the same line of business

153
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:54,929
as Donald, and it's gonna kinda set up this like little rivalry. This is a well that Barks is gonna go to a lot.

154
00:21:55,704 --> 00:22:03,204
And and then can you tell us about their arrival sue at the end of this page? This is probably my favorite frame of the whole page.

155
00:22:03,544 --> 00:22:04,264
Of fish.

156
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:17,994
Fish just kills me. It's like on top of the water running like his fins our legs, and I just... I don't I don't know what it is about it, but something just does it me, and I'm like, where is that fish going? And and we'll see later what that fish is running from

157
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:23,683
as he his he draws in the clue, but I I love just the little hint that that fish is like, I'm out of here.

158
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:28,570
Yeah. The Barks really goes kinda wild with the background gag in this Love it.

159
00:22:29,422 --> 00:22:31,536
Yeah. And and and it's a nice panel.

160
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:38,555
The the site is great. But they like arrive in the jumping off place, which is Chilled, British, Columbia,

161
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:41,749
and you know, they can tell that it's not a very crowded

162
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:49,100
country at all. And on the next page, Donald is finally gonna encounter his sample case.

163
00:22:49,658 --> 00:22:56,497
But the the guy who he asked is, like, yeah. If you wanna call that a sample case, and he indicates a

164
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:10,564
truck with a covered bed and and Donald takes a look under the the cloth that's hiding it and, you know, we just get his reaction as reader. And I really like this device

165
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:28,004
sue where Barks is kinda setting up this you know, this mystery, this question, What do you think about that? I think I think he does this brilliantly. Like, he could have revealed it here that he drags it on just a little bit longer. I I love how we get to see the manager's reaction to what Donald gonna sell with his like,

166
00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:33,943
kind of a sinister smile, and then we got Donald reaction of just like pure

167
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:56,011
shock and like, oh, man, what have I gotten myself into? And and we still... like, the nephews are like, well, what is it? What is it? We still don't get that until further on. And I think I think it's a lovely lovely device that I'm sure. The target audience of ti would have really really enjoyed. Yeah. I mean, I I had to kinda think back to the first time I read this. And I I do remember being in like, big suspense.

168
00:23:56,786 --> 00:23:58,203
So, you know, Donald,

169
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:02,906
he he seems a little bit per and he's not willing to reveal

170
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:07,325
his pride, won't let him reveal what he has to try and sell to the nephews.

171
00:24:07,764 --> 00:24:13,701
And they try to make their way on the next page into the terror cory and they

172
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:16,571
they encounter kind of a g old fisherman

173
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:30,701
who tells them, you know, you're looking for a road, but there ain't no road miss the the only way to go up the Kick mc quick river is to go up the river. And and so, you know, Donald again, he's he's in that very stubborn mode and he

174
00:24:31,174 --> 00:24:34,874
decides to hire some men to build a raft.

175
00:24:35,214 --> 00:24:43,320
And, you know, we we train... This is obviously a huge undertaking so, we we transition and we get get right into it.

176
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:51,911
Can you kinda close out this page for us? Yeah. I was... When I was reading that like, we're gonna get some men to build me raft and I was like, who, the fisherman?

177
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:59,707
And he Karl Barks just skips right over. Like, the next morning, they've got this raft. It's got like a paddle wheel and everything, and they've got...

178
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:02,320
They're like, alright. We're gonna go find ourselves some customers.

179
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:14,587
And they go for miles and miles and miles without a house without a shack, not a single soul, in which they could sell anything too. Until finally, at the last panel, you see this kind of

180
00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:28,637
rams shack house that's like, cropped up on a board with steam or smoke coming out the chimney, and they're like, they're finally a trap shack, a customer it lasts. And you just know, like this person is not going to buy whatever

181
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:32,433
in the back of your truck that's bigger than their house.

182
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:34,850
Yeah. Very well said.

183
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:43,176
You know, you mentioned that transition. I I'm reflecting and and there are times when Barks does this in a way that I kind of appreciate now

184
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:46,509
he has to be a very spare storyteller

185
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:49,389
to to tell this in twenty four pages

186
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:54,564
And when I think about it, I don't need to see a bunch of guys building a raft.

187
00:25:54,904 --> 00:26:25,709
Right? Like, it... It's interesting to think in storytelling that sometimes you can give yourself permission to just skip some of the boring parts. Yeah. No. You gotta know when to slow down and when to speed up when to Zoom in and went to Zoom out. And I think this was a perfect example of of him being able to do that because he could have gotten some, you know, funny site gag or some, you know, good good last out of them trying to find enough people to build the thing. But it wasn't worth it. And so he just skips right over it. Yeah. So on the next page, we see Donald approach

188
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:32,324
to this shack. And you know, i I wanna be careful here because, like, the the depiction of the person

189
00:26:32,664 --> 00:26:33,724
inside is

190
00:26:34,064 --> 00:26:38,579
it's very funny. It's also very like mock Right? But

191
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:49,634
do you... Do you mind telling us about his encounter? His depiction of every person he's sells to is very mocking. There there is nobody that he sells to who is not being made fun of.

192
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:53,449
The first one, the second one and then when we get to the native village, and

193
00:26:54,107 --> 00:26:58,882
and yeah, I just... Went like, you can't help but kind of laugh at that h

194
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,766
look of Yep. This is my house. I'm the lady of house.

195
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,279
Right. And I like the kind of approach. You know, he doesn't quite wanna reveal

196
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:17,110
the mac of what they're selling yet. Right? So he has the sales pitch take place through the Nephews eyes.

197
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:27,938
Where they're talking about, you know, I wish we could hear his pitch. And we just kinda see a little bit of a reference to on a pressure of three hundred and twenty five pounds, you would get it. Etcetera, etcetera.

198
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:31,170
It's very funny. He comes to

199
00:27:31,508 --> 00:27:34,261
the the cost of the item that he wants to sell.

200
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:40,454
And he looks it up in the book for the very first time and sue, how much does this mon

201
00:27:40,954 --> 00:27:49,535
cost? I love this. I love this but they. He had no idea what he Al no idea how much he's selling for. He looks it up and it's twenty two thousand dollars.

202
00:27:49,912 --> 00:27:57,594
Yeah. Oh that's beautiful. Ninety two grand in nineteen forty nine is is about a quarter of a million bucks.

203
00:27:58,274 --> 00:28:00,294
This this basically trap,

204
00:28:00,674 --> 00:28:01,394
trap lady.

205
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:07,903
And she says, I like her line. Three three sci too much. I got twenty two dollars.

206
00:28:08,242 --> 00:28:12,589
And and so of course, he is stumped. At his first sale attempt.

207
00:28:13,086 --> 00:28:17,215
The nephews go in and try and they say they had wonderful

208
00:28:17,832 --> 00:28:33,500
and they sold twenty two dollars worth And so you know, we're set up for this dynamic that we're gonna get a lot with Donald and the Nephews where they're they're kinda... They have that kind of golden type. Right? Barks wants to see them succeed. And he wants to put Donald.

209
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:45,060
He likes Donald as an underdog. I mean, he's not... He's not like that lovable underdog in this one because he's doing everything wrong. But... But on the next page, we see them transition

210
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:50,414
up to up the river a little bit farther, looking for the next customer.

211
00:28:51,254 --> 00:28:54,614
And again, it's just transitions to more miles pass.

212
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,929
And tell us about

213
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:05,942
the approach for the next customer so. This is where this is where I started to get nervous because I knew that there were going to be some problematic

214
00:29:06,401 --> 00:29:11,377
depictions of native peoples. And we get to this cave, just this cave with like bones

215
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:15,108
outside and smoke coming up but I'm like, if they

216
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:21,640
depict native people as some sort of primitive cave men, I'm not gonna be able to finish. Right.

217
00:29:22,532 --> 00:29:29,366
And so, you know, they... He's he's like, calling his truck up onto the onto this like cliff face and

218
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:38,129
the nephews are like, we're gonna go first like down and he's like, no. You get back. I'm I'm gonna go first. This is this is my job here. Steals their stuff. Yeah.

219
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:52,762
I can't sell. He can't sell his own stuff. They had a great luck selling this... This makeup to this... Oh, no. We don't know what it is yet. Do we. Right He just... He just... He still doesn't know what it is, but he knows it has to be better than what he's selling. Right. And and

220
00:29:53,259 --> 00:30:01,387
I think that kids actually love this sort of sense of outrage here. Right? Like this, this raises your hack as the reader instantly.

221
00:30:01,923 --> 00:30:09,903
You are so upset with Donald. For doing this for a common during for stealing, as you said, they're their sales line.

222
00:30:10,681 --> 00:30:21,016
They kind of accept it. And they're like, okay. Well, this this thing, whatever it is is is ours now to sell. So we get the big reveal

223
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,069
and

224
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:27,669
tell us to tell us they on earth and what is it sue? They've got this big giant

225
00:30:28,464 --> 00:30:43,689
steam oregon. They call it a steam kelly. I had actually never read that word before, but it's it's just massive with this big boiler engine and these giant giant pipes and this like decorative scrolling around it. It's just it's just a beautiful mon.

226
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:50,347
It it really is. Like I find it very appealing to look at. Right. And you called it a steam Al,

227
00:30:51,064 --> 00:30:55,208
and that's that's how I read it as a kid. For many years.

228
00:30:55,746 --> 00:30:58,883
Before I learned that many people call it a

229
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:03,332
Right? But... Oh, there you go. But don't feel bad because

230
00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:05,130
according of wikipedia,

231
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:20,994
there there's a lot of contention about how you're supposed to pronounce it. People might chuckle and say or mispronouncing, you know if you say Al. But back when these things were like, a fixture and pop culture because they would be like attached to steam ships

232
00:31:21,654 --> 00:31:22,954
or they would be pulled

233
00:31:23,254 --> 00:31:25,074
alongside steam, you know, engines

234
00:31:25,454 --> 00:31:25,954
locomotives

235
00:31:26,254 --> 00:31:38,084
as sort of a like audience get for carnival and stuff, that there was debate and and many people would pronounce it Tally, and there were a couple of songs that would kind of make fun the two different

236
00:31:38,503 --> 00:31:46,729
pronunciations that you could make. So so again, as a kid, I pronounced its steam call in my head until I learned one day it was,

237
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:50,482
and then I switched over. So I'm thinking of as a steam.

238
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:58,044
But this... I think it's notable that this thing is dated even by the standard of like, seventy years ago.

239
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:03,499
This thing is a crazy thing to sell in nineteen forty nine absolutely

240
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:10,471
anywhere. But in the Pacific Northwest, on the K quick River, of course, this this is a farce.

241
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,944
And so

242
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:18,416
And so, yeah, Donald doesn't even know what it is. This is what he referred to as a pressure cooker what the nephews point out

243
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:26,500
on the next page And we see Donald going up into this sinister looking cave as you called it. And he encounters a character.

244
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:30,867
Right? Tell tell us about the hermit so. Herman the hermit

245
00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:31,945
very

246
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,501
very little there.

247
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,909
He comes out into the light, and he's just he's just hair. Like, he's just hair with us.

248
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:42,149
And you wonder what is this guy supposed to be?

249
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:50,675
See supposed to be big foot? Is he supposed to be a human like what? What is this guy supposed to be? And you don't really ever get an answer.

250
00:32:51,169 --> 00:33:07,367
No. You don't. He... He's such a wild character that I don't think you can even like... He's not problem at it. He's just weird. Right? No. He's just weird. Like I don't know who he would be making fun of. He's just weird. So I I think back in the day, there was more of this like idea of the

251
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:10,257
you pronounce a ace acidic aesthetic...

252
00:33:10,716 --> 00:33:16,370
You know, the spartan man who goes out into the woods and just lives this life of hermit

253
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:28,999
You know, you that that that's still a thing, but I think it was more of a thing back then and he is just like the the Uber cliche of this verse who obviously hasn't seen a barber in in many decades.

254
00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:30,239
Yes.

255
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:33,239
So so Donald discovers

256
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:35,848
what the kids line of

257
00:33:36,226 --> 00:33:43,359
of goods is, Tell us about it too. This is this is the perfect spot to reveal what the kids are selling. They they could have they could have told you earlier, but the fact

258
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:57,971
he opens up this giant box and it's just lipstick and nail polish and just a million products that this guy has zero. You four. Right. Right. And it's become clear why they had some success with the trap lady previously.

259
00:33:58,586 --> 00:34:01,999
So On the next page, Donald she tries to sell.

260
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,419
But, you know, he's he's offering things like luminous

261
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:10,291
eyebrow pains to make your step oh in the dark.

262
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,104
There are some admittedly great lines in here.

263
00:34:14,642 --> 00:34:17,936
You know, the hermit, he seems like doing some lipstick for your girlfriend.

264
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:19,547
I don't have a girlfriend

265
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:25,350
and I don't want one. So, you know, after five minutes of trying, he's like, alright. This is the last cause.

266
00:34:25,843 --> 00:34:29,774
And then nephew you sort, like, you know, we we might as well give it a shot.

267
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,806
And and they just kind of announce

268
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:37,919
they cut their hands and announce into the cave. Oh in there. Wanna buy a steam Al

269
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:39,379
and

270
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,179
tell us about Herman

271
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:45,474
response there. So this frame is is so beautiful Al he's like

272
00:34:45,814 --> 00:34:52,008
leap out of his cave with his arms in the air and all of his hair is standing up on him. He's like, a esteem

273
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,167
like it's...

274
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:55,723
Like it's his fun story.

275
00:34:56,702 --> 00:35:07,588
Oh, and then and then the best part is when they come down the hill to tell Donald, but they've made a cell and they've got their biggest sack. The big sack that just has twenty two thousand.

276
00:35:09,602 --> 00:35:15,390
Like the Her had a sack of exactly twenty two thousand dollars with the amount written on it inside of his little cave.

277
00:35:16,163 --> 00:35:17,382
Right. It's it's Al.

278
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,450
It's a great site gag. And and I neglected to mention that herman referenced,

279
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:32,192
you know, there's he is only one desire in the world and you wouldn't be selling it. So, you know, this is Barks poetic justice. Right, For the Nephew.

280
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:41,664
He he loves this kind of setup. And this is this a pretty common trope, but... But I think it's well played here. I'm not a big fan of the, like,

281
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,219
comedic

282
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,899
suicide attempt is Donald like, for laughs jumps in.

283
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:53,348
Oh I didn't even notice that. There he is. He's jumping off. I just thought, you know, you're frustrated you gotta a jump.

284
00:35:53,886 --> 00:36:00,026
Yeah. I maybe it's not. Maybe it's not that old trope. Maybe he's just jumping in out of fresh frustration. But

285
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:09,129
but, you know, again, that's just one of the tropes of the day. And and so So we continue up the up the K me quick river.

286
00:36:10,265 --> 00:36:15,435
Donald is just stew at this point because he can't take it back. Right? He already

287
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:18,966
all's all's fair and and love warren and salesman.

288
00:36:19,505 --> 00:36:20,005
And

289
00:36:20,544 --> 00:36:21,284
and Donald,

290
00:36:21,743 --> 00:36:25,054
he's like, he's done with the whole thing. He tells them turn... Turn the

291
00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:31,198
over to the hermit and call it quits. But they're like, no. That's our sample case.

292
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:37,184
Like, they're gonna find another hermit who fond the stream is natalie i'm somewhere open in those bills.

293
00:36:37,943 --> 00:36:44,012
Right. Right. This has already been the best case scenario. As far as I'm concerned they, it really should turn back. But...

294
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:45,331
But they don't?

295
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:50,205
No. They they consult the map and they find out that, you know, the the river almost

296
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:52,497
ended, and and

297
00:36:53,275 --> 00:36:57,390
we get a little throw a line about how no one has ever been farther.

298
00:36:58,401 --> 00:37:06,969
This is something that we heater in a couple of Barks stories, you know, and he wants to create this sense of danger. We're deeper in the ever Gladstone and any man has ever been

299
00:37:07,908 --> 00:37:15,934
obviously, it's any quote white and and and the Ducktales do represent like white people. Right? They are explicitly coated as white

300
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,254
And and literally, they're they're white Ducktales.

301
00:37:19,514 --> 00:37:28,506
And and so, you know, they're they're talking it over and they've realized, yeah, they should turn back at this point. But then Donald see some smoke signals in the distance

302
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:35,872
before they're thereabouts turnaround around. And you know onto to the next page, they realized that this this must be they say Indians

303
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,587
up up in that area, most people would would say first nations

304
00:37:41,485 --> 00:37:42,124
or natives.

305
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:56,434
Are sending messages. Right? And and then After you have a moment of of t where they... Again, they call it they call them savage indians. This is the trope at the time. Because because all modern indians use telephones,

306
00:37:57,269 --> 00:38:02,329
and donald is thinking that this is a great opportunity. Right? Because he's gotten now this

307
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:04,209
suitcase full of lipstick

308
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:07,740
that he could sell to

309
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:09,375
to these natives.

310
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:15,597
I think the implication is, right, They must use war pain, so this is a great opportunity

311
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:24,960
This is where the story really takes a a pretty cringey turn. Right? It still has some fun elements, but it's it's gonna be colored by

312
00:38:25,795 --> 00:38:34,190
by these attitudes for me, and and I I'm guessing for you as well. Agreed. Yeah. No. And I went into it expecting some cringe and

313
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,630
I'll be honest that if I had to...

314
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:40,470
If you force me to write a

315
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,842
parity scene, of some really

316
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:52,470
gross stereotypes about native peoples. I would not like, just go over the top with it would not have been able to be

317
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:56,710
to the next few pages before. I was a little bit shocked.

318
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:19,820
Yeah. And and I I like bringing newbies in to read these. Right? Because people who have grown up with these comics, we kind of just we don't think about them or we tend not to think about some of these representations or we kind of like sweep it under the rug. And and again, it's worth acknowledge that these these were universal attitude. Right? This was not him trying to be hateful.

319
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:27,994
This was just how society was. It doesn't excuse it. But... Oh, it's just lazy. He's not being hateful. He's just being lazy.

320
00:39:28,873 --> 00:39:36,504
He he's reverting to these tropes that were They were the language of storytelling at the time. We we have storytelling language

321
00:39:36,924 --> 00:39:57,414
these days that that is lazy to in different ways and we understand better but there there just... There are tropes where everyone understands this is how native people act. In nineteen forty nine. So I'm sure I'm sure eighty years from now the people will look back at our story telling tropes and Cringe and whatever we've gotten wrong.

322
00:39:58,348 --> 00:39:59,607
Yes. Exactly.

323
00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:04,859
So, you know, they they... There's a neat little scene where they crash into the end of the river.

324
00:40:05,473 --> 00:40:09,443
And, you know, the nephews are pondering. Well, what do we do now? We run out of river.

325
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,539
And Donald,

326
00:40:11,137 --> 00:40:11,916
he's like

327
00:40:12,548 --> 00:40:19,920
I've just got this suitcase so I'm gonna head forward on foot, and this is one of those scenes where he's gonna just abandon the nephews.

328
00:40:21,174 --> 00:40:23,394
Has one dogs with children in the wilderness.

329
00:40:23,894 --> 00:40:33,284
Right. Right. But but, you know, this is a little bit of kind of wish fulfillment too. Right? These Huey, dewey movie are very resourceful. So we're not worried about them. Donald

330
00:40:33,823 --> 00:40:36,920
on the next page he heads for the the smoke signals.

331
00:40:37,553 --> 00:40:38,053
And

332
00:40:38,910 --> 00:41:03,259
there's a a couple of fun side gag, a little bird carrying a big fish in the day. I was gonna say the fish. The fish keeps going throughout because you've got the first fish who's running away and and you wonder why he's running away, and then you get the the seagull with the fish and his mouth and the hard popping out of his head and then you get the fisherman and then you've got this bird with this fish and soon we're gonna get to the village with all the other fish. It's a very dangerous place for a fish. It's true.

333
00:41:03,718 --> 00:41:08,613
So so Donald is pushing his his his ware through this wilderness.

334
00:41:09,312 --> 00:41:11,530
And then he comes across

335
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,697
it's it's a tote pole. Right? We get this little

336
00:41:15,035 --> 00:41:18,726
gag shock scene where he's he's frightened and faint.

337
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:25,730
Because of a tote pole that's obscured behind a bush. And again, these are very important symbols

338
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:38,643
but they're like this novelty for white people. Right? Like, they're they're fascinating and and they're beautiful too. So I get why this was a good hook. It's it's very touristy. Right?

339
00:41:39,181 --> 00:41:44,124
Oh, yes. Very touristy. So on the next page, you know, we have him wake up

340
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:46,682
and kinda of realize with embarrassment

341
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,776
that he took a big fright over just tote and pole.

342
00:41:51,455 --> 00:41:57,009
Continues onward. And we kind of flash forward to the native village. There's this

343
00:41:57,509 --> 00:42:07,716
narrative box that describes it. As you know a Barks Dell a short distance ahead is the village of the most primitive Indian tribe in North America.

344
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:11,449
I'm not gonna use the the term. But.

345
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:29,356
Yeah. The the... They refer to to, you know, their skin these these natives have never seen white men, but they've heard lots of things about them all bad. So so there's a a lot wrapped up in that narrative. A lot to unpack in this in this frame right here.

346
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:34,280
Tell. I think I think it's interesting that he uses the slur and yet,

347
00:42:35,014 --> 00:42:39,509
he draws the natives Al very fair skinned to people. They

348
00:42:40,047 --> 00:42:45,849
look like white people. Like, did he just not have the tools? To draw them with with docker skin.

349
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:48,860
A brief interruption that

350
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,150
Barks wouldn't have colored.

351
00:42:51,604 --> 00:42:56,004
These... Oh, okay. Right? He he did the drawing, but someone else would have colored.

352
00:42:56,564 --> 00:43:04,359
But I think that that this is probably how he would have expected them. To to have been colored because he drew them as like humans.

353
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:12,532
Mh. But it's it's... I don't know. There's so much to unpack here. Right? That these These natives have never seen whites

354
00:43:13,111 --> 00:43:16,467
men, but they've heard lots of things about them, all bad.

355
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:18,185
I know some truth.

356
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:25,219
There's some truth. I'm not I'm not trying to, like, cast versions against all white people. But from the perspective

357
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:31,074
of someone in the pacific Northwest. I think it's a fair. I think it's a fair attitude.

358
00:43:32,214 --> 00:43:34,929
Right. And then What do you think about the village

359
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:38,409
itself? The village itself is really interesting.

360
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:54,016
Because you did... You did say, like, there's there's all the fish drying on the racks and, you know, people are working and they've got this lovely canoe that they're they're writing in, and and and it's just dotted with tote pulls, which I thought was really strange because

361
00:43:54,594 --> 00:43:56,930
in my understanding, they were they were something

362
00:43:57,363 --> 00:44:22,057
sacred and something that you would have like one off for the village and maybe I'm wrong and how that works, but it just seemed very tote and po to me. Yeah. I mean, I think they are grouped sometimes. But I think you're right. They're usually more spa and they're usually like way markers, I think. You know, Al entrances and stuff. To me, this this village is like very lovingly drawn. Right? And it and it's showing these long houses,

363
00:44:22,608 --> 00:44:32,360
you know, Donald references on a previous page that he can he can go on foot to sell from T p to t b. So he doesn't... He does the classic American thing of

364
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:33,773
confusing all natives

365
00:44:34,112 --> 00:44:35,091
for one another.

366
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,408
But you know, Barks is

367
00:44:37,947 --> 00:44:43,299
differentiating them. He obviously knows what what it looks like up there. And and the

368
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:53,634
the dress that's shown for the medicine man, he's very stereotypes, but I I feel like the dress is drawn from reference, you know, the the outfit.

369
00:44:54,454 --> 00:44:58,234
And and we can see like fish drying. We can see people

370
00:44:58,669 --> 00:45:06,669
at work and at play. I I think he gets a little bit of credit for kind of drawing what looks like a society, you know.

371
00:45:07,564 --> 00:45:11,544
I I don't wanna I don't wanna like, get go overboard because

372
00:45:11,844 --> 00:45:13,784
again, there's some very

373
00:45:15,057 --> 00:45:15,996
like cliche

374
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,665
very like racist of its time

375
00:45:20,082 --> 00:45:37,593
attitudes on display here. But but there is also a little bit more care and and detail. I I think by the standards of of the time, he actually was going out of his way to show them a little bit more complex and I kinda ruins that when he when he opens their mouths. Right. No.

376
00:45:38,509 --> 00:45:42,112
Because, you know, you get here and you're like, okay. This could be worse.

377
00:45:42,711 --> 00:45:52,805
But but, yeah, he does a ruin it when they open their mouth. Yeah. You know, So we get we get a couple of the natives talking to each other it's the medicine man and the chief.

378
00:45:53,463 --> 00:45:56,557
Okay. So he references them holding a pow.

379
00:45:56,975 --> 00:45:59,170
Right? And that's not what pow is french.

380
00:45:59,703 --> 00:46:01,239
No. It's it's not

381
00:46:02,013 --> 00:46:09,550
not what a pow is. I think that that is like a navajo term. Right? Yeah. No. It's it's it's a very ceremonial

382
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:27,006
sacred thing. It's not like I know, you know, now we're like, let's pile out about this. It's like a meeting or a discussion, but for for them, it was it was like a big thing. But when I read that, I'm like, nope. That's not what pow wow is guys. But but they meet up to talk about, you know, they've obviously

383
00:46:27,423 --> 00:46:27,923
scout

384
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:29,795
Donald and the boys

385
00:46:30,132 --> 00:46:30,491
approach.

386
00:46:31,064 --> 00:46:31,564
And

387
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:34,517
they reference the smoke writing

388
00:46:34,975 --> 00:46:35,795
that says

389
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:42,920
that someone else has communicated to them that some pale faces are coming. Right? This is the old trope of of natives

390
00:46:44,140 --> 00:47:00,193
referring to White men pale face. And I think this was in use. I don't think it was used the way that it is in Hollywood all the time. But, you know, they're they're talking about... They they understand what donald coming for. There he's coming to sell, bad medicine,

391
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:04,783
right? Some bum goods. And they're using that very pigeon Hollywood

392
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:07,873
Indian. Type of speech that I'm not gonna replicate.

393
00:47:08,732 --> 00:47:08,971
Thank you.

394
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:10,590
They're they're

395
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:27,751
they're referencing, you know, what they're gonna do. They're saying that we're not scared of of these men coming. We're very brave, and that's a little setup for Donald sudden arrival. Can you can you describe for us his is sudden arrival and that natives response.

396
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:31,890
Yeah. They're... Like, in the frame before, they're... It's all calm, everybody's

397
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:50,895
going about their business and then the next frame, donald appears to have popped out of nowhere. Yeah. He's standing up a high on A rock, and he's just shouting just like right this way ladies and gents lovely lovely warm paint and I curl and give away like, he is just shouting at the top of his lungs and, like all the people are like, whoa.

398
00:47:51,394 --> 00:47:58,145
And know people are like, hiding and diving behind things and running away because he is very loud and he came out of nowhere.

399
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:06,877
Right. And and I think it's supposed to be like a a play... It's it's supposed to do a couple of things. Right? It's supposed to show the natives as super

400
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:09,474
or or, you know, t.

401
00:48:10,293 --> 00:48:15,841
It's also supposed to show Donald in a pretty poor light that sort of like ugly American trope,

402
00:48:16,339 --> 00:48:17,477
you know, that blu.

403
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:24,319
I I think that Barks is definitely poking a little bit of fun at him because who does this. Right.

404
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:28,914
He's this is the hard cell approach that someone might do

405
00:48:29,253 --> 00:48:31,471
Al a place that they know

406
00:48:31,865 --> 00:48:34,025
you know, mcdonald is just going into this,

407
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:35,645
not knowing anything.

408
00:48:36,025 --> 00:48:43,900
And trying this hard sell approach. And they're comic running away. They're climbing up Tote Paul, which I gotta... I gotta

409
00:48:44,360 --> 00:49:02,220
believe is no no. Oh, yeah. I don't know anything About tote bowls, but I I'm pretty sure that's a no no. Right. One of them is burrow into the ground. Is is very funny, but it's also, like, it's not a great one. No. Alright. Welcome back to... You and I took a short little break there because time zones are hard,

410
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,280
But

411
00:49:04,075 --> 00:49:07,331
but it also gave me a little bit of an opportunity

412
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,985
to educate myself about tote pulls a bit.

413
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,260
And I I just wanted to jump back a little bit to the page that we covered

414
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,000
Two pages ago, the one that gives us such a nice view of the actual village.

415
00:49:20,615 --> 00:49:25,115
It's it's interesting to me. I've I've since realized that Barb actually

416
00:49:25,655 --> 00:49:30,641
did go to some some care, I think to to get some things right about it.

417
00:49:31,338 --> 00:49:37,155
And and I've I've relied a little bit on a an entry in the Canadian and encyclopedia that talks about

418
00:49:37,734 --> 00:49:46,848
tote poles and, you know, again, I'm I'm not gonna go on and on. But it is it is worth noting what he got right. So we were talking a little bit

419
00:49:47,957 --> 00:50:00,725
ago about, you know, you mentioned it's striking that there are so many tote poles like right outside people's houses in the village. Right? And and that that is apparently a thing. You know, they they would commonly have house

420
00:50:01,065 --> 00:50:06,486
tote or or how you polls. And they might be part of the construction of the house. They might be

421
00:50:06,943 --> 00:50:09,753
supporting it. And they might show someone's family lineage.

422
00:50:10,265 --> 00:50:12,877
But I noticed in that picture that they're all

423
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:18,036
they're all facing that river. You know, and that's a detail that apparently is accurate.

424
00:50:19,088 --> 00:50:21,144
Apparently tote poles would be oriented

425
00:50:21,802 --> 00:50:23,738
towards the nearest body of water.

426
00:50:24,395 --> 00:50:26,191
That is fascinating. I had no idea.

427
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:27,943
Yeah. So

428
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:34,866
it it... It's telling me that he actually... I think he probably thought of himself as going to some level of care.

429
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:39,611
And respect when he was making this. And and I think he

430
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:40,449
probably

431
00:50:40,906 --> 00:50:42,164
didn't even

432
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:43,261
envision.

433
00:50:43,754 --> 00:50:52,818
Not using some of the tropes that are just such a pattern of thought that people didn't realize. It's it's like breathing the air, you know? Yeah. No.

434
00:50:53,456 --> 00:51:07,108
You don't know what you don't know. You don't know what what thought patterns are just ingrained into your society until they're pointed out to you. Right. And so I'm not I'm not trying to excuse him for, you know, the the treatment that we're gonna get on the next few pages.

435
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:19,645
It's it's more about... I always say, I it doesn't skews it. It just helps you understand it. As far as the tote themselves, you know, I I learned that they will, of course commonly depict animals and and animals

436
00:51:19,945 --> 00:51:25,277
include, like, beaver and wolf and bear and Barks and killer whale. Which sounds awesome.

437
00:51:25,677 --> 00:51:31,526
Raven, eagle, frog, mosquito, and these represent, like, kinship and group membership

438
00:51:31,864 --> 00:51:33,282
and and identity

439
00:51:34,075 --> 00:51:39,370
and then they will also show supernatural beings or humans as well.

440
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:43,346
And I think that's probably we're getting kind of a mix of the two.

441
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,858
So, hey, we've just

442
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:53,222
passed the page where Donald has created a big commotion a big stir by trying to, like, very vulgar

443
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:59,997
hawk his ware to the village. You know. And it's supposed to be for comic the fact that's definitely kind of an ugly American

444
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:11,010
stereotype or where I guess, even a, like a colonize or stereotype. And and so on the next page, you know, Donald has noticed that everyone's cleared out And so he's gonna approach

445
00:52:11,347 --> 00:52:14,717
them with the hard Al. He's he's pounding on

446
00:52:15,134 --> 00:52:15,634
doors

447
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,427
and he decides

448
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:19,436
so, do you mind highlighting

449
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:24,303
his his strategy when he can't get anyone to listen to his sales pitch?

450
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,992
He goes banging on doors and shouting at people and

451
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:32,268
makes a suggestion about bringing some tear gas that he's

452
00:52:33,046 --> 00:52:42,791
disappointed. He hasn't brought along. And eventually, he gets to the point where he decides that he's just gonna put on a show. And he's gonna demonstrate how p he is when he's wearing his lipstick.

453
00:52:43,325 --> 00:52:43,825
And

454
00:52:44,125 --> 00:52:45,825
he's got this lovely picture of him

455
00:52:46,525 --> 00:52:50,725
with his his bill up with big giant red lips at the end.

456
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:56,713
Mh. And it's admittedly pretty funny. You know? I I consider this an uncomfortable

457
00:52:57,131 --> 00:52:58,005
situation that is

458
00:52:58,944 --> 00:53:07,567
nonetheless pretty funny, because it's a it's a very silly image. It's interesting to me that Donald, you know, goes there. He's not, like, he's not worrying about his masculinity

459
00:53:07,905 --> 00:53:11,597
in this case. There are gonna be a lot of comic comics where he's

460
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:20,348
super worried about his masculinity, but he's he's desperate to be a super salesman so he's demonstrating. And what's the response that this generates?

461
00:53:21,204 --> 00:53:23,937
They they mob him and he is

462
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:41,755
he is just... It's like the opposite of the of the panel above where they're all running away and exploding out. Now they're all exploding in and there's even more bodies in the frame and they're all converging on his his suitcase of Al lipstick and makeup there. Right. Yeah. That's a good description. It is the opposite.

463
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:45,850
And and so on the next page, you know, the next page is basically

464
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:47,370
devoted

465
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:48,250
entirely

466
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:49,410
to

467
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,490
the the silly

468
00:53:52,043 --> 00:53:52,543
concept

469
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,257
of of these

470
00:53:55,072 --> 00:53:55,890
these natives

471
00:53:56,427 --> 00:53:56,927
trying,

472
00:53:57,503 --> 00:53:58,401
trying cosmetics

473
00:53:58,977 --> 00:53:59,477
and

474
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:06,030
failing to understand it properly to to comic effect. Do you wanna any of them stand out to you?

475
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:08,730
When I was going through this

476
00:54:09,084 --> 00:54:09,944
I did

477
00:54:10,482 --> 00:54:12,620
enjoy the guys eating soap

478
00:54:13,078 --> 00:54:13,578
because

479
00:54:14,037 --> 00:54:15,735
I have been in many

480
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:20,345
artists and soap shops where they smell good enough to.

481
00:54:20,684 --> 00:54:31,665
And I'm like, I buy that. I buy you take some some delicious food smelling thing into some people that don't know what it is, and that they'll take a bite out of it because I almost once.

482
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:38,620
Right. Yeah. That... That's that's another good point. But like. I've been a child who's like, this... This stuff smells

483
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,355
these fragrances smell so good. How could it taste bad.

484
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:46,795
So, you know, it's it's kind of a balance here. Right? These are all some pretty good

485
00:54:47,215 --> 00:54:54,035
comic images that are they they've nonetheless to me, they feel very uncomfortable. Right? They feel exploit.

486
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:55,370
Yeah.

487
00:54:55,928 --> 00:54:59,673
It definitely feels like they're saying, look at these stupid

488
00:55:00,169 --> 00:55:02,501
stupid people that don't know anything about anything

489
00:55:02,957 --> 00:55:05,626
and isn't it funny. Isn't a funny that they don't know what we know.

490
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:15,175
Right. And and I I've realized that there, you know, definitely fans that kind of share my perspective in my mindset. And then there are fans that have been reading these for

491
00:55:15,713 --> 00:55:26,200
you know, since they came out, and they definitely have a a different perspective. And they would point out, oh, you know, Barks makes fun of everyone this way. Barks will put anyone in in these ridiculous

492
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,040
situations.

493
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:33,880
And and I I hear what they're saying, it's just that, like, to me, it's really hard to get past

494
00:55:34,315 --> 00:55:38,374
what what this feels like? I think that if they

495
00:55:39,075 --> 00:55:42,055
had Al lit allowed the characters to speak naturally

496
00:55:42,795 --> 00:55:49,223
without the because the crunch, if you just look at the pictures, it's funny. It's funny because you're like, oh, somebody's is eating

497
00:55:49,682 --> 00:55:55,448
soap and somebody's is, you know, the man is wearing lipstick. It's funny until you read the words that are coming out of their mouths.

498
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:59,779
Yeah. Yeah. You're you're right. Because it's got that sort of, like, Hollywood

499
00:56:00,676 --> 00:56:01,176
typical

500
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:13,245
way that natives were poor portrayed. And right, we... And and Barks didn't have to do that. Right? Because we're hand waving the fact that if these this is a remote village, there's no way they should be speaking English.

501
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:15,965
Right? So it's it's a decision

502
00:56:16,345 --> 00:56:19,165
to make them speak in this like, pigeon.

503
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:20,458
Indian.

504
00:56:21,154 --> 00:56:24,007
But again, this was just like the language of

505
00:56:24,345 --> 00:56:26,480
papa art. You know, you put the

506
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:29,192
at the end of a verb, smell.

507
00:56:29,744 --> 00:56:47,011
You you you take out you take out all the auxiliary, the the is is and the rs. It's a pigeon speak. And For some people, they grew up with that and it's like, evo evo, I think of of media that they've always consumed and they don't view it as

508
00:56:47,324 --> 00:56:51,931
it's not problematic to them. And some people had that that switch flipped

509
00:56:54,143 --> 00:57:01,570
where it it's just incredibly cringe worthy. But again, you're right. Like, on their own, these are these are just funny imagery.

510
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:10,818
It's artistic. There's some funny ideas here. So onto the next page, we kinda get the fallout of them trying all of these make, and cosmetics

511
00:57:11,357 --> 00:57:11,857
and

512
00:57:12,476 --> 00:57:16,664
things like one of them has has applied nail polish to his face.

513
00:57:17,122 --> 00:57:18,539
Someone has drink

514
00:57:18,917 --> 00:57:19,896
has drank

515
00:57:20,274 --> 00:57:21,652
perfume or something

516
00:57:22,364 --> 00:57:24,124
do you wanna describe any of them?

517
00:57:24,564 --> 00:57:26,584
Yeah. I think I think the

518
00:57:27,084 --> 00:57:30,104
the most amusing one is the chief not having any hair.

519
00:57:31,539 --> 00:57:33,319
Because it it's funny.

520
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,959
Well people are funny. Sorry bald people.

521
00:57:36,299 --> 00:57:37,679
I don't know why you're funny.

522
00:57:38,274 --> 00:57:42,350
One day, maybe somebody will look back on this and Scrooge it Me laughing Al both people, but, you know.

523
00:57:43,788 --> 00:57:49,038
You know, I as someone who's very proud of the tiny amount of follicles he has, I I hear you.

524
00:57:49,637 --> 00:57:52,775
You know, my knowledge too is, like, I remember

525
00:57:53,234 --> 00:57:54,333
Navajo people

526
00:57:54,992 --> 00:58:12,204
in Arizona for whom the hair is like it's an incredibly important thing. Right. Which is why it's less funny. I don't know anything about the Pacific Northwest Right. And so I don't know if They have the same, you know, kind of regard for it. Some of the other tribes do. And if they did, that I wanna make it even prettier.

527
00:58:12,943 --> 00:58:13,443
Right...

528
00:58:14,101 --> 00:58:15,854
But... Yeah. No. I see

529
00:58:16,314 --> 00:58:18,212
I see the humor he was going for.

530
00:58:18,591 --> 00:58:26,977
Kids think it's funny, one grown do stupid things. And so I I understand what he was trying to do there. But it's really hard to separate it from the...

531
00:58:27,356 --> 00:58:29,295
Just the v era of cringe worthiness.

532
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:36,284
Right. So so Donald realized he's Gottfredson angry mob. Coming after him and he's got a head for the hills.

533
00:58:36,964 --> 00:58:37,984
And so

534
00:58:38,564 --> 00:58:43,559
on the next page, he is figuring out how to hide. And we get this kind of meanwhile

535
00:58:44,058 --> 00:58:46,552
transition, and we check in on the Nephews.

536
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:47,829
And,

537
00:58:48,526 --> 00:59:12,872
you know, this this sets up a pretty cool part of the comment. I think probably one of the... One of the most memorable parts. I like this. Do you do you want tell us about what the Nephews user are up to Yeah. They're they're waiting for him. And I I imagine that all of the stuff that he's doing is taking some time. And so they decide that they're gonna they're gonna play their their little steam organ there. And they you you gotta see him, you know, getting his logs so we can

538
00:59:13,729 --> 00:59:19,356
light the fire and get the steam and they play louder and louder and louder and then like

539
00:59:19,695 --> 00:59:25,169
the earth is shaking because they're playing so loud, and then suddenly the rocks start falling down the clips.

540
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,478
And then they have

541
00:59:28,054 --> 00:59:32,755
some disaster, but I don't know if you wanna stay on this page for another minute before moving on to their disaster.

542
00:59:33,289 --> 00:59:39,621
Well, I I do wanna move on. I just... I just wanna point out to me it's it's such a neat little situation. Right? I imagine

543
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,740
three boys

544
00:59:41,253 --> 00:59:44,587
with nothing to do, and I'm in charge of esteem,

545
00:59:45,443 --> 00:59:49,456
and I'm surrounded by the the wood that I would need to stoke the boiler

546
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:50,548
Absolutely.

547
00:59:51,084 --> 00:59:58,220
Right? What what are you gonna? Why not. You you wanna hear it. You wanna see it in action. Yeah. Go. Go ahead. Keep... Keep telling us about the outcome.

548
00:59:58,954 --> 01:00:04,294
Okay. So they're they're playing so so comic loud but it's making the shake. And then

549
01:00:05,114 --> 01:00:14,359
the cliffs side, it starts to cave in and the the whole side of the gorge just just comes down on them. Makes the huge landslide and it opens up a path.

550
01:00:15,052 --> 01:00:17,284
To where they think Donald has gone.

551
01:00:17,842 --> 01:00:18,342
I'm

552
01:00:18,759 --> 01:00:19,936
impressed at how

553
01:00:20,273 --> 01:00:22,505
intact they are. Right sure.

554
01:00:22,918 --> 01:00:24,733
A giant landslide in the gorge.

555
01:00:25,468 --> 01:00:39,786
Yeah. It's it's pretty unlikely. This is one of those things where we gotta accept the comic book physics of it. But it it does... It makes for a great situation. And I love the sequence on these two pages where, you know, they're talking about what they're they're gonna play the William Al overt.

556
01:00:40,259 --> 01:01:07,093
With all the steam they've got, and they're just ex and getting it louder and louder and than the Nephew who's manning the the keyboard says I couldn't play louder if I had cannons for base. I do love that line. So on the next page, you know, we we transition we transition Al the end of this page back to Donald who's gone in hiding, and the the villagers are looking for him. And eventually, they have to give up because he seems to have escaped.

557
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:08,291
And,

558
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:10,289
you know, we transition

559
01:01:10,628 --> 01:01:12,007
to just this average

560
01:01:12,426 --> 01:01:14,024
village who's a little boy.

561
01:01:14,959 --> 01:01:16,259
Very cute little boy

562
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,699
who asks his dad

563
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:39,003
tell us sue about what he's asking his father. He's he's asking his dad if tote and polls grow, which I think is very... I I like the the the person that noticed this. Wasn't one of the one of the people out searching and hunting was just a little kid, who notices a tiny detail that's different and says hey dad, do tote

564
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:39,500
grow.

565
01:01:40,233 --> 01:01:44,304
And it's it's a funny detail. Right? It's a funny little punch line. It sets up.

566
01:01:45,022 --> 01:01:52,689
The dad's like, what a silly question. Why are you asking? And he points out one of the village tote poles is two feet taller than yesterday.

567
01:01:53,429 --> 01:01:55,369
And of course, we're getting

568
01:01:55,843 --> 01:01:58,295
this setup that that is part of the

569
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:00,464
part of the comic appeal,

570
01:02:01,061 --> 01:02:02,455
I think for people,

571
01:02:02,949 --> 01:02:08,376
who read this originally, because this is even shown on the cover, you know, Donald hiding.

572
01:02:08,735 --> 01:02:11,031
And it's it's this weird

573
01:02:11,743 --> 01:02:16,564
dynamic for me. Well, like, in and of itself, it it is funny.

574
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:17,741
It's

575
01:02:18,078 --> 01:02:18,578
clever

576
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:30,144
And and again, it just has this element of cringe of, you know, where where he's hiding, and it's hard for me to separate it. From that. And and I'm sure there are people who are

577
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,220
annoyed

578
01:02:31,836 --> 01:02:34,927
by my woke tan or whatever. But

579
01:02:35,439 --> 01:02:42,679
But that but that's where I am. It's impossible for me to appreciate this one the way I could as a kid.

580
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:51,375
And I'll note that this was never really one of my favorites as a kid. I I certainly enjoyed parts of it. But but that... That's where I

581
01:02:51,689 --> 01:02:54,006
and with this this kind of key moment.

582
01:02:54,486 --> 01:02:55,964
No. I think that makes sense. I mean,

583
01:02:56,923 --> 01:03:08,705
we're all different people at different stages of our lives and that's where you are now and don't think there's nothing wrong with it. And I don't think there's anything wrong with you enjoying it as a kid. You know, you know what you know when you know it and you do the best you can.

584
01:03:09,479 --> 01:03:15,211
Yeah. So so we transition to, you know, him having been captured and the indians

585
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:16,029
planning.

586
01:03:16,603 --> 01:03:20,736
The the villagers planning for what they're gonna do with him. And

587
01:03:21,114 --> 01:03:26,245
you know, it's interesting here so, he he the chief is deciding to

588
01:03:26,997 --> 01:03:35,712
give them a punishment that's kind of slaps. Right? Because they it could go a totally different area. There were references to scalp earlier.

589
01:03:36,624 --> 01:03:42,924
They're gonna... They're gonna meet up with paddle boards. They're talking about brewing up a batch of medicine that

590
01:03:43,304 --> 01:03:44,884
that is like a hair remover

591
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:53,723
and Donald is calling out for his nephews to help him. And we see them approaching carefully with the in the truck with the steam.

592
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:57,395
So then on the next page, they're they're approaching

593
01:03:57,853 --> 01:04:01,346
and they noticed that they they can hear drums in the background

594
01:04:02,059 --> 01:04:09,839
and they're questioning whether the people are gonna like steam music, they're kinda reassess whether they can be good customers.

595
01:04:11,232 --> 01:04:11,732
There's

596
01:04:12,948 --> 01:04:13,688
there's a

597
01:04:14,585 --> 01:04:16,003
another very cringey

598
01:04:16,461 --> 01:04:21,324
panel where they talked about how only ignorant Indians still be tom toms.

599
01:04:22,179 --> 01:04:25,548
Usually, the nephews are gonna be much more sensitive than donald, but

600
01:04:26,005 --> 01:04:30,388
one of the Nephews goes had to scout out the village. And he sees the situation

601
01:04:30,925 --> 01:04:40,709
right away with Donald, and so they immediately kinda convert back to a rescue mission. And they're thinking that they're gonna use the steam

602
01:04:41,329 --> 01:04:42,069
to divert

603
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:44,389
their the attention of the villagers

604
01:04:44,744 --> 01:04:48,564
so that they can save What I think this is an excellent plan on their part

605
01:04:49,064 --> 01:04:51,364
because they just played this

606
01:04:51,664 --> 01:05:06,087
this organ. This be loud enough to cause a landslide in a course. So I think I think they're thinking on this is spot on like if we can cause that kind of ru with this thing, surely we can cause a big enough diversion to say save our uncle here.

607
01:05:06,546 --> 01:05:13,512
Yeah. For sure. So they they make way down the hill, but they encounter a bump that sends the the Al

608
01:05:14,551 --> 01:05:15,930
and the truck toppling

609
01:05:16,403 --> 01:05:18,859
over. I'm crashing pretty horrific.

610
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:20,015
And,

611
01:05:20,912 --> 01:05:22,170
you know, we see the nephews

612
01:05:22,588 --> 01:05:31,344
and a lot of the components. Of the client bound down the hill. And we flashback Barks to that clever little boy who's pointing out to his

613
01:05:31,843 --> 01:05:34,240
father that he heard a a distant crash.

614
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,474
The father is now not really regarding him again. He says it's just a tree that fell down.

615
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:52,284
And, you know, the Nephews kind of gather themselves. They realize that they're injured, but basically un unheard, you know, they they don't have their their strategy anymore. So they've gotta to figure out a better way to

616
01:05:53,184 --> 01:05:54,784
to scare them out of town,

617
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:58,359
and that that gives them a a slightly different idea.

618
01:05:59,279 --> 01:06:00,139
And so

619
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:08,905
it it becomes clear on the next page what their idea is. Right? They want to... Why don't you tell us sue about their plan here? They're

620
01:06:09,363 --> 01:06:13,469
they're they're kind of walking around the the crash site and sc pieces

621
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:15,749
trying to see if they can

622
01:06:16,249 --> 01:06:27,324
find enough parts that they can still make some noise, and they find some some whistles and part of the keyboard and but they find their pipes. Their pipes are all rec up. Their pipes are not gonna work. And so

623
01:06:27,624 --> 01:06:29,899
one of the... One of the the little ducks

624
01:06:30,756 --> 01:06:33,491
notices that the tote poles have

625
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:45,244
big holes in them in their hollow. And so they get the idea that we we need something to follow. We need something to be pipe. Let's try this. Right. So they're they're gonna use the tote as

626
01:06:45,598 --> 01:06:46,737
there pipes

627
01:06:47,156 --> 01:06:50,213
for for the ka. One of them says we're gonna have a

628
01:06:50,592 --> 01:06:51,550
that is Al.

629
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:54,303
And that that line always

630
01:06:54,961 --> 01:07:04,629
always perplexed me as a kid because it feels like it should have some kind of double meaning but he's referencing there, but I couldn't really ever figure that out. So I always got kinda hung up on that one.

631
01:07:05,209 --> 01:07:07,068
But we transition to Dawn

632
01:07:07,769 --> 01:07:11,129
when they're gonna take when the village is gonna take their vengeance.

633
01:07:11,744 --> 01:07:12,604
On Donald.

634
01:07:13,144 --> 01:07:13,644
And,

635
01:07:14,024 --> 01:07:20,404
you know, the chief calls upon the ancestors. This is that sort of like Hollywood, early Hollywood

636
01:07:21,278 --> 01:07:22,456
this era of comics,

637
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:26,404
h come, right, where someone is making up

638
01:07:26,901 --> 01:07:30,769
some sort of sacred tradition. Who knows if this is something that they would have done.

639
01:07:31,622 --> 01:07:40,554
At this time at least it made for it made for a ceremony. Right. And and you need them to cast their attention on the tote.

640
01:07:41,409 --> 01:07:41,909
And,

641
01:07:42,369 --> 01:07:44,229
you know, the tote basically

642
01:07:44,929 --> 01:07:58,988
respond the way that we the reader know that they're about to. And and tell us about this. He's got... He's got, like, almost a whole have page here with the the tote. I I don't know where the river went, but they're no all facing

643
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,264
towards the people,

644
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:10,442
like all of them are like, bearing down at them like some sort of like angry god, and they've got steam and Scrooge and hoo and whatever coming out of them, there's a wood picker

645
01:08:10,899 --> 01:08:12,077
flying for its life

646
01:08:12,453 --> 01:08:14,766
and there is a lot of noise.

647
01:08:15,818 --> 01:08:18,277
Right. Yeah. It's it's created this huge

648
01:08:18,776 --> 01:08:26,881
catastrophe of noise It's terrified the villagers. They they do exactly what the nephews have hoped. They run for the hills,

649
01:08:27,417 --> 01:08:34,955
and it seems like it's worked. But but we flash to that clever little boy again, who notices what's going on and processes it.

650
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:38,749
And heads to tell his father as the ducks

651
01:08:39,089 --> 01:08:40,749
are also running

652
01:08:41,089 --> 01:08:41,889
from the hills.

653
01:08:42,264 --> 01:08:46,244
And I alluded to this earlier, but, like, I think that this panel

654
01:08:46,824 --> 01:08:55,527
was like a sort of back engineered thing. I don't I didn't read this in any background. I'm I'm just speculating that it felt like Barks had the idea

655
01:08:55,903 --> 01:08:58,214
to have to incorporate a steam Al

656
01:09:00,142 --> 01:09:05,909
into this story with tote and poles and he wanted to put them together in this really

657
01:09:06,247 --> 01:09:22,659
spectacular way that the plot was gonna hinge on. I I can see that. This is this is definitely a moment where, you know, an artist would wanna hang hang their plot on a really interesting idea and an interesting visual image. And I I can see how you could reach the conclusion that he

658
01:09:23,197 --> 01:09:39,209
reverse engineered the story to build to this moment. Right. And and it is a really interesting and and technically beautiful page, I think it's got some great detail, the fun background gag of the Wood pe. You know, again, it's just... It's hard for me to get past how

659
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:41,986
I realized this is a rescue mission. Right?

660
01:09:42,944 --> 01:10:05,615
Just on the face of it. If you... I think if you presented this to a native person, this would be really profoundly gross to them. So so that that has colored for me what is otherwise a a pretty artistic cool moments. And and so the the next Scrooge is the final one, and we get a lot of before we... Before we move on to that, I just noticed something on this page that I was like

661
01:10:06,352 --> 01:10:23,934
just just took my level of cringe to the next just make up and notch even though I didn't think it was possible. Where where the the natives are running and they're saying the Tote are mad And this is the only speech bubble. I'm gonna read. They gone lo. And I just like really you're in Canada.

662
01:10:24,354 --> 01:10:28,026
Local is from way down the other direction you guys.

663
01:10:28,445 --> 01:10:28,945
Like

664
01:10:29,364 --> 01:10:32,719
like, we couldn't tell which brown people we were making fun of here.

665
01:10:33,494 --> 01:10:42,489
Yeah. I had that thought too. And I and yeah like, I was thinking on it too much, But you're right. I I think this is from that sort of, like, cowboys and Indians

666
01:10:42,829 --> 01:10:43,329
idea

667
01:10:43,789 --> 01:10:47,949
because, you know, in the Wild wild West where most native representation was,

668
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:51,741
you would also be kind of a a lot of that cowboy

669
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:52,779
jargon

670
01:10:53,236 --> 01:11:00,111
was very mexican influenced. So... Yeah. That's that's how they've got they've he's got him using the word lo.

671
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:06,564
So the the last page is an interesting wrap up. Right? Because we have the the villagers

672
01:11:07,023 --> 01:11:08,841
recapture the Ducktales pretty quickly.

673
01:11:10,059 --> 01:11:13,574
The docs are protesting. You know, they're worried about their fate.

674
01:11:14,109 --> 01:11:19,129
And they're saying, you know, one of the nephew says, what do you want with us and uses a?

675
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:24,624
And the chief says make the Tote sing again. We like it.

676
01:11:25,405 --> 01:11:27,985
I... I think this is another another

677
01:11:29,019 --> 01:11:39,038
point for your your theory that he just reversed engineered the whole plot to reach that one that one moment because now that he's had that moment, like, He's done. He's done with the story. It's time to wrap it up.

678
01:11:39,535 --> 01:11:58,454
Right. We're we're wrapping it up really quickly. We're... I guess I like that that they kinda go out on on decent terms. Right? It it gives the... It gives the the first nations people at least a little bit of a sense of agency that they've, like, figured things out. They've understood things and

679
01:11:58,834 --> 01:11:59,954
they're they're able to, like,

680
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:06,411
advocate for something that they want now and that they like. That... That's probably like damning it with faint praise.

681
01:12:06,868 --> 01:12:11,091
But, you know, at least it's not the Ducktales just running from the hills,

682
01:12:11,787 --> 01:12:12,566
leaving everything

683
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:15,596
unresolved. There there's kind of a mutual...

684
01:12:16,213 --> 01:12:18,467
They they arrive at some sort of mutual

685
01:12:19,059 --> 01:12:26,390
faction, I guess is the best I can say. And so we we transition to a couple weeks later with with Donald in the office

686
01:12:26,823 --> 01:12:27,642
of that

687
01:12:28,339 --> 01:12:29,636
sales supervisor,

688
01:12:30,253 --> 01:12:34,661
explaining that he and his helpers have sold five hundred

689
01:12:35,038 --> 01:12:35,538
pillows.

690
01:12:37,809 --> 01:12:50,469
Do you wanna wrap up the the, like, transaction here? And, like, the the the sales manager or whatever is is is clearly shocked because like, did did they even run into five hundred people

691
01:12:51,166 --> 01:13:00,453
on their journey up in the up in the spa wilderness there. But anyway, Donald tells him that you know, he's got the train loads of payment in the station, and

692
01:13:00,989 --> 01:13:11,795
and he's like, well, say something. And then the the manager just faint backwards in this chair and you've got this a fun image of the, like, the boots up on the up on the table because he just cannot believe it. Yeah.

693
01:13:12,409 --> 01:13:20,141
Yeah. It's it's pretty funny. And and the the people have paid for it with train loads, you mentioned of min skins. I don't even know if

694
01:13:21,173 --> 01:13:26,693
I guess that that clocks but that's Al that's a just a fantastic load of new skins.

695
01:13:28,559 --> 01:13:30,820
And and we transitioned to

696
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:34,539
Donald having clearly won the competition

697
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:35,914
and he's

698
01:13:36,534 --> 01:13:44,809
Daisy kinda pops in at the very end here. We don't get to see a lot of daisy in in these adventure stories usually. She's usually devoted. To the ten page

699
01:13:45,389 --> 01:13:46,829
comedic stories that he does.

700
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:47,969
But

701
01:13:48,590 --> 01:14:06,461
tell us about, you know, what he's shot sharing. She's she's only stepping into the story to kinda receive this last little bit. Right? Right. Right. She's just there. So he can have someone to brag to. He's got his his hand on his I guess duck hip. I don't I don't know. He's he's obviously very proud of himself. And then the next page seems like

702
01:14:06,814 --> 01:14:12,065
straighten his bow tie and popping is chest up in the air and he's got the grand prize for being the super salesman,

703
01:14:12,443 --> 01:14:16,270
and it's it's is one of the steam compliance. It's just

704
01:14:16,649 --> 01:14:17,149
gigantic

705
01:14:18,044 --> 01:14:18,982
in their time.

706
01:14:20,594 --> 01:14:27,173
It's a good gag. It's a good way to finish it off. It is. I I do like that ending. I like the the image of the Nephews

707
01:14:27,872 --> 01:14:34,505
very annoyed keeping it polished and cleaned, and it's just the most impractical thing ever.

708
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,219
To have in your home.

709
01:14:36,679 --> 01:14:40,420
Stay in your home, it's not gonna it in your home. It's outside of your home.

710
01:14:41,079 --> 01:14:42,139
Yeah. Absolutely.

711
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:43,675
So

712
01:14:44,253 --> 01:14:47,265
So that wraps up the actual story contents

713
01:14:47,682 --> 01:14:49,595
of land of the tote poles.

714
01:14:50,154 --> 01:14:54,896
And, you know, this is this a really interesting one. It's it's short it's brisk.

715
01:14:55,753 --> 01:15:07,916
You can certainly tell by the conflicted way that I've been talking about it. That this one doesn't hold up for me. I I do see as we talk about it, I do see a lot of things that I like about it. You know? There's...

716
01:15:08,372 --> 01:15:10,666
There's all these neat little site gag

717
01:15:11,058 --> 01:15:21,423
the the structure of the story is pretty cool. And I I think I really enjoy it basically the... What you had said up until they get to the outskirts

718
01:15:21,919 --> 01:15:23,256
of the native village.

719
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:25,925
It's it's a pretty fun

720
01:15:26,261 --> 01:15:29,367
far silly story. And it just gets

721
01:15:29,745 --> 01:15:39,082
too challenging for me after that. There there are still like, elements that are a lot of fun and exciting and and drawn well and cleverly and funny,

722
01:15:39,421 --> 01:15:59,482
but but it's hard to get past some of that stuff. I know that you... This is your first mark story. And I wanted to... I wanted to curate it a little I asked you to read a couple of other Barks stories because I hated the idea of this, you know, being such a g want. Do you mind telling me what you thought of this story? And then if

723
01:16:00,178 --> 01:16:08,515
maybe you didn't care for the other ones, that's fine. But I'm curious how it compared to I I had asked you to read ghost of the g which is one of my personal favorites

724
01:16:08,894 --> 01:16:09,714
and then also

725
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:13,670
lost in the Andes, which is is a personal favorite, but is also

726
01:16:14,183 --> 01:16:16,097
regarded it as one of his very best.

727
01:16:16,615 --> 01:16:17,115
Yeah.

728
01:16:17,493 --> 01:16:30,685
I I agree with what you were saying earlier that the story was really fun right up until the end there. I think I think that, you know, if they were to reprint this with some careful editing of some of the

729
01:16:31,261 --> 01:16:31,699
dialogue,

730
01:16:32,074 --> 01:16:33,534
and just ended after

731
01:16:34,114 --> 01:16:35,174
the the nephews

732
01:16:35,474 --> 01:16:35,974
sell

733
01:16:37,914 --> 01:16:39,074
clarity to her and the hermit.

734
01:16:39,848 --> 01:16:49,740
I think it would be funny short story. Like, I I think that part stands well on its own but but you're right. It was it was harder to get into. I think as far as story structure goes,

735
01:16:50,557 --> 01:16:56,446
I think I I think it's structured a little bit better. It surprises me that you're saying that the

736
01:16:56,759 --> 01:17:07,773
what was the the one with the square eggs tone Austin andy. Oh place It surprises me that that's one of the the all time favorites. Because I think that was my least favorite of the three that I read

737
01:17:08,392 --> 01:17:11,729
You strip away if you strip away the c of of this one.

738
01:17:12,068 --> 01:17:15,285
I I really enjoyed ghosts in the g. I think it had a really

739
01:17:15,599 --> 01:17:20,048
fun kind of spooky element to it and some good

740
01:17:20,665 --> 01:17:32,970
foreshadowing of the, you know, the the kids that go missing every every fifty years or whatever, and I really liked the the way that they kind of built up this possibility of supernatural and then they had it all blamed out.

741
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:39,710
Right on. So, yeah, that's interesting to me. But but... Yeah. It's... So you did see some things to like in this one.

742
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:41,544
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

743
01:17:43,321 --> 01:17:48,029
I knew I knew the cringe was coming. And so I was prepared for it. Mostly.

744
01:17:48,843 --> 01:17:51,733
I I did tell you that it was more than I was expecting.

745
01:17:52,986 --> 01:18:09,841
But again, I don't I don't consume a lot of media from the forties. So Right. I I just wasn't used to it. This just wasn't something that was part of any any media consumption I've ever I've ever had, but there were really nice moments. And I did I did tell you. My favorite thing was the fish.

746
01:18:11,014 --> 01:18:13,189
Just the just the image of that fish

747
01:18:13,726 --> 01:18:20,186
running for his life on the top of the water and you can see as the goes on all the horrible faith of all the other fish in this area.

748
01:18:20,999 --> 01:18:23,093
Just thought it was a great site gag. And so...

749
01:18:23,429 --> 01:18:33,707
Yeah. Barks loves his site gag. And this is definitely near the top of of his site gag game, because there there are some really great ones in here. There's some really great expressive miss.

750
01:18:34,283 --> 01:18:36,018
I I love the salesman

751
01:18:36,889 --> 01:18:40,125
stuff. I think. You know, that's my favorite aspect of it.

752
01:18:40,885 --> 01:18:44,435
Again, I think this story wants to do that. Really cool

753
01:18:44,815 --> 01:18:48,415
it viewed is really cool mel of the tote pulls and the steam Al.

754
01:18:49,215 --> 01:18:58,210
And this is kind of a kitchen sink story. It feels like, right where he's got... He's got this aspect with Native Americans and tote poles. And he's got this aspect with salesman

755
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:10,401
and and Al already outdated steam in Ka that he's he's bringing in just because he wants to have them collide and For me, that's part of why it doesn't work as much as some others

756
01:19:10,899 --> 01:19:14,371
because he's he's just kind of throwing everything together that he wants.

757
01:19:15,025 --> 01:19:20,218
Yeah, it's a really interesting story. You know, it's it's a fan favorite so. I Al.

758
01:19:21,777 --> 01:19:23,076
Yeah. I always

759
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:30,665
I always check it on a site called Index. Right? Not index, but du, which is like a crowds sourced

760
01:19:31,443 --> 01:19:45,565
resource where fans can also vote on they can rate these stories. And so enough fans do that it gives you a pretty good idea of what the community thinks. Not perfect, but this one has an eight point two out of ten, which is

761
01:19:46,024 --> 01:19:48,362
very very high. There

762
01:19:48,821 --> 01:19:50,280
like forty one thousand

763
01:19:50,593 --> 01:19:51,890
Disney comics

764
01:19:52,426 --> 01:20:00,872
overall rated on this story. Because Disney comics have been around for, you know, a super long time and so That's good enough to make this one ranked eighteenth

765
01:20:01,649 --> 01:20:04,582
out of all forty one thousand some stories.

766
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:14,860
It it is biased towards the carl Barks stories. Right? Because he's the legendary duck man. So, like, you don't even get a a non Barks story until you're, like

767
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:17,098
down in the mid twenties.

768
01:20:17,636 --> 01:20:18,136
But

769
01:20:18,835 --> 01:20:28,489
I I think that this... I think that people really remember it for the hook Barks himself probably talked it up a lot because it was a personal favorite of his.

770
01:20:29,185 --> 01:20:35,683
And and then, you know, I think that a lot of people have rated these over the years with their fond memories.

771
01:20:36,301 --> 01:20:54,389
And and this did come out of what was considered as golden age from, like, roughly nineteen forty eight to fifty too. So so I I... There are a few stories in that range that I view is maybe not mediocre but not quite living up to the others. And I think they just get a little bit of shine of his golden name. But,

772
01:20:54,849 --> 01:20:55,909
you know, I...

773
01:20:57,010 --> 01:21:03,681
Different strokes and different folks. I I do like aspects of this one. It's just it's hard to get past some of that.

774
01:21:04,419 --> 01:21:04,498
Yep.

775
01:21:05,936 --> 01:21:11,005
Let's see. We we've talked a lot about how it holds up which is say it really doesn't.

776
01:21:11,739 --> 01:21:19,524
I like to mention sue if he ever made one of his famous oil paintings for a subject. I don't believe he did make one And then

777
01:21:20,023 --> 01:21:26,435
sometimes the Duck tales shows will have adapted some of these stories. And I am not aware of them ever

778
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:27,448
adapting

779
01:21:27,865 --> 01:21:28,365
anything

780
01:21:29,779 --> 01:21:35,635
from from this story at all. I like to talk a little bit about the educational value that these stories have

781
01:21:36,094 --> 01:21:48,881
I do feel like this one was actually a bit educational about the first nations because it it seems like it did get a lot of stuff right by the standards of the time. It just was so wedded to those, like, late forties

782
01:21:49,379 --> 01:21:50,517
universal depictions.

783
01:21:50,975 --> 01:21:54,643
So, did you you talked about some panels that stood out to you.

784
01:21:55,381 --> 01:21:59,912
Are are the fish side gag, your favorite panels or is there one that kinda comes out

785
01:22:00,409 --> 01:22:02,365
comes up to your memory as a favorite?

786
01:22:02,899 --> 01:22:05,112
I I really do think the fish is my favorite.

787
01:22:05,648 --> 01:22:08,300
I like... I I do also enjoy

788
01:22:08,677 --> 01:22:10,572
the way that the hermit

789
01:22:11,521 --> 01:22:12,858
leaps out of his cave

790
01:22:13,235 --> 01:22:18,929
so delighted about let's i be... I like I just like the body language in that one. Just how

791
01:22:19,588 --> 01:22:27,824
delighted and joyful it is and and the the nephews with their their sack of sack of money with to twenty two thousand pounds

792
01:22:28,201 --> 01:22:33,510
labeled on it. What's good stuff. Yeah. That is good. I really liked the sequence

793
01:22:33,849 --> 01:22:35,348
just leading up to the Nephews,

794
01:22:35,887 --> 01:22:39,758
having fun s the boiler of the and causing in the landslide.

795
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:46,155
And I like that shrewd look that the sales manager gives at the beginning. Oh, yeah. That's a great

796
01:22:46,653 --> 01:22:53,739
Yeah. So thank thank you so much for joining me. I hope I hope there's a a good one to have you on back for

797
01:22:54,278 --> 01:22:58,562
maybe maybe sometime we could coordinate one where you and Ryan

798
01:22:59,098 --> 01:23:07,832
could both join me. That that could be a lot of fun. That'll be a lot of fun. You might have to send me some tranquil as darts for my kids. And. We'll work it out. Yeah.

799
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:10,645
Any final thoughts before we wrap this one up?

800
01:23:11,657 --> 01:23:16,140
I had more fun, than I thought I was gonna have three comics from the forties. So, you know

801
01:23:16,596 --> 01:23:22,824
awesome. Yeah. Thanks thanks for that. I like to think that they definitely stand up better than most from this era.

802
01:23:23,804 --> 01:23:26,000
So next episode, hope,

803
01:23:27,096 --> 01:23:37,662
I haven't put off too many people with my attitude towards this one, but we're gonna talk about the the second story that was published in this issue. Trail of the unicorn.

804
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,935
And as always, people can get in touch with me

805
01:23:42,072 --> 01:23:46,813
or share comments on the Facebook page or Barks remark. At g dot com.

806
01:23:47,268 --> 01:23:47,864
Thanks again.
