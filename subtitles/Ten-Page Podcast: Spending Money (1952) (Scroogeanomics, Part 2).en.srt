1
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:09,384
We have

2
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:32,399
Hello, and welcome to Barks Remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comic of all time. This episode is a ten page podcast, all about one of his short stories. Get ready to enjoy our remarks.

3
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:37,246
Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever.

4
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:42,120
And my guest Sarah Santiago and I are going to resume

5
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:45,835
part two of our episode on screw genomics,

6
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:49,034
and we're gonna be talking about spending money.

7
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:50,866
Alright. So

8
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:55,448
Sarah for this second part of our screw Genomics

9
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:59,254
episode, I want to read a quote

10
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:02,815
that I found of Barks from way back when

11
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:06,266
when I was looking up the story stat

12
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:11,865
spend f. He's talking about this other famous ten page where he's in this

13
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:13,261
like ridiculously

14
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:22,680
expensive statue building contest with the mah raja of how do use stand and he said that the statue building contest between Uncle Scrooge and Mah

15
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:38,570
became ridiculous Al time went on. I don't blame one woman for writing a letter saying that she thought it was a gross misuse of money. I wrote back to the office, telling them that the woman had missed the point entirely, all the money that had been spent on those statue have gone into

16
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:52,585
circulation. Much better than if it had continued lying in the Mah raja money bin or sp just money. That money had created a tremendous amount of work for jeweler and gold smith's and concrete men and hydraulics

17
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:53,085
experts.

18
00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,591
Everybody had a job out of that so the money hadn't been wasted. And so that that right, there is a big,

19
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,010
like,

20
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:02,405
philosophical

21
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:03,345
idea.

22
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:06,685
Right? We we talked about kind of the

23
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:07,525
inherent

24
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,660
propaganda or editorial

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:27,166
that lay at the heart of a financial table. And the next story that we're gonna be talking about spending money is really like that quote written large. That quote turned into a story. And again, just like financial,

26
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:31,001
he's got these, like big ideas that are being

27
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:43,088
a founded it upon in this funny animal comic book and and they're... He's writing them as though, they're an iron cloud law as the universe. When there... There's a lot of for debate there.

28
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:44,705
So

29
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:45,480
Sarah,

30
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:48,192
that quotes to me, like,

31
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:52,534
really sums up how Barks feels

32
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:54,586
about, you know, kind of the, like,

33
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:58,117
stimulus power of money

34
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:02,754
some of the good aspects of essentially concentrating

35
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:09,704
wealth. And it it really strikes me as like a a a very ahead of the time

36
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,768
advocating for the policy of supply side

37
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:15,425
economics.

38
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,500
Which I would argue

39
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,819
is is a big part of

40
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,299
how the Reagan

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,079
administration ruined America.

42
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:28,149
Not to get too political for this up episode. But

43
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,986
but I think these are very political stories.

44
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:34,680
So Do you do you know about the Laugh four curve Sarah?

45
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,560
I don't.

46
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:44,930
What is that? So just in brief, the Last curve is this like idea sketched up by an Economist named Arthur

47
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:48,745
la firm. Literally on a cocktail napkin can,

48
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:52,456
And and he became very influential

49
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:53,775
in the reagan

50
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,330
administration. And it's basically what gave the American right the idea

51
00:03:58,885 --> 00:03:59,385
that

52
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:04,825
what justify the idea of supply side economics. Right? It was impossible

53
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:07,680
to cut taxes too much because

54
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,439
money that

55
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,680
stayed in the hands of the rich

56
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:13,159
was

57
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:20,439
extremely product Ducktales give money, and it would stimulate the economy and you would actually get more revenue.

58
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:22,233
Because

59
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:26,617
money in the hands of Rich people is so incredibly productive.

60
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:28,716
Like a financial.

61
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:31,633
This is a story that to me is like

62
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:33,950
incredibly tightly plotted

63
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:43,185
very very funny and and works in and of itself with the rules that Barks has given it, that really falls apart.

64
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:45,215
When you try to apply

65
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:49,002
examine it as an economics experiment.

66
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:51,651
Very much like supply side economics.

67
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:52,663
Yes.

68
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:54,081
So

69
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:59,426
this one is is also very highly rated. It was originally published

70
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:10,621
and walt disney comments and stories number one hundred and forty four in September of nineteen fifty two. So just a few months after a financial table.

71
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:18,477
And a reminder that that one was rated seven point seven good for one hundred and twenty nine on index.

72
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:26,032
This one is also a seven point seven. Just a little bit below of one hundred and fifty nine.

73
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:27,324
And

74
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:29,681
like a financial,

75
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,996
it's generally hangs out in the top ten rankings.

76
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:36,687
Of all of his ten pager

77
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:42,840
if you just break them apart. So this is a very well remembered very well regarded

78
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:46,962
ten page story by Barks among fans.

79
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:50,846
So what do you say? You ready to talk about this one?

80
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:52,358
Ready.

81
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:53,753
Alright. So

82
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,308
spending money

83
00:05:56,124 --> 00:06:00,451
is one of those stories that opens on Scrooge is money bin

84
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:05,669
And it's a very recurring theme where he's having problems storing all of his money.

85
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:12,289
He's pondering about this is the trouble with being rich what do you do with all the money?

86
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,250
And he

87
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,389
he barely manages to close his vault when his clerk.

88
00:06:19,844 --> 00:06:23,496
Brings up this like, cart load of money bags

89
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:27,486
explaining that it's a sack of last month's receipts

90
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,777
from things like his movie theaters

91
00:06:31,234 --> 00:06:31,734
and

92
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:34,011
and his dress shops

93
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,814
and Scrooge is pondering how he didn't even know he owned these businesses.

94
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:43,040
And and this is like a very

95
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:44,197
sort of

96
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:48,003
This is a very accurate picture of the idea of a Ty

97
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,930
having his fingers in so many businesses that you don't even know.

98
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:55,003
All the things that you want.

99
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,640
And so eventually,

100
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:19,268
all of these new profits add up to this massive pile of at least thirty tons of money with no place to keep it and Scrooge is left to ponder. What is he gonna do with this windfall? You did mention that it's a recurring theme that he can't store all his money and that was one of the questions that I had was how often

101
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,384
are we

102
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:23,535
starting a the story out with him

103
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:24,851
not being

104
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:26,047
able to

105
00:07:26,504 --> 00:07:28,175
find storage? I I'm

106
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:32,190
in just the few that the I've read for the podcast,

107
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:33,908
it's quite a theme.

108
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:41,099
Yeah. Yeah. That's a good thing to point out. This comes up a lot, you know, we saw it in Christmas for Sc town.

109
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,553
I can think of it in...

110
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:51,486
Well, I can't think of it under under pressure, but but I think it's safe to to assume that there's

111
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,860
probably a dozen or two stories with some

112
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,340
variation on this.

113
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:05,615
It... It's it's a great theme for bark to go back to. Right? Screws is the super rich guy. He's got this great concept of a man with, like,

114
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:13,700
all this physical money, what are the problems with physical money? How to store it, how to keep it safe.

115
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:23,476
And what to do with it. So we get a couple of those things here. Right? And it answers a question that I've always had. With these stories

116
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:29,912
Why does it he put it in a bank? But he's saying that the things have refused

117
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,382
the banks they've refused him because he's already

118
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:36,691
taking up too much of their space with his money already.

119
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:47,386
Right. Exactly. Barks does some pretty good setup here. Because as you mentioned on the next page, you know, he's Donald comes over, and he's complaining to Donald about this awful

120
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:48,303
problem.

121
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:53,983
And and Donald is making the suggest, you know, build a bigger bin,

122
00:08:54,442 --> 00:09:00,776
but Scrooge complains that that would cost billions, what's the point of spending billions to storm millions.

123
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:12,345
I don't think the logic works there, but at least at least Barks is addressing it. Right? Mh. And then he suggests putting in the bank and as you say Scrooge

124
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:18,700
is like every... Banks refuse me at this point and and that that kinda of rings true.

125
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,300
And so we land at the only

126
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,155
real solution as Donald sees it, which is to

127
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,835
spend this

128
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:28,935
cash.

129
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,155
And I I really like sp and Donald

130
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:40,442
expressions here as they're pondering this problem and sp is a gas Al the idea of spending it. What I I like

131
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:41,660
even better.

132
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:43,015
Is that he's

133
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:45,375
unwilling to pay donald

134
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:48,215
for his help. Right He negotiate

135
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:52,104
down from Donald request of fifty cents to that

136
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:53,262
to

137
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,619
thirty cents.

138
00:09:55,436 --> 00:10:08,037
Right. Right. Like the very obvious solution to this problem that he, you know, doesn't even entertain and Donald probably knows not too. Is the Donald could take some of it off of his hands.

139
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:11,563
But but I kinda like how it's just so under...

140
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,405
It under underpins Scrooge characters so much. That

141
00:10:17,543 --> 00:10:21,799
we... He doesn't even ask to be given the money. He just

142
00:10:22,178 --> 00:10:25,615
proposes that Scrooge hire him to spend it.

143
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:32,681
Right. Because, you know, that work ethic that he's always trying to flip drill into Donald. Use a good way to

144
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:33,813
to

145
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:35,504
earn the money.

146
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,236
Right. And and I like Donald

147
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:45,834
excitement at the idea. And And honestly, this is a great bit of wish fulfillment. Right? Because, like, who wouldn't

148
00:10:46,173 --> 00:10:49,210
This is a great exercise. Who wouldn't love the task?

149
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:54,245
Of getting to spend a massive pile of money. It it's

150
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,045
almost to me,

151
00:10:56,385 --> 00:11:06,435
like, It's almost a blessing to be told that you can't keep it and that you have to spend it. Right? Because you don't have to stress about being responsible

152
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:11,895
quote with it. I I like that term wish they'll fulfillment. So much.

153
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:13,155
Because

154
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:15,884
you know, as a a formerly

155
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,718
very poor person,

156
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:18,715
I

157
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,589
have fantasize size

158
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:25,430
so much about what I would do with any amount of money, let alone

159
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,702
screwed just money. Right. And

160
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:34,059
and I, you know, I'm still... I still think about that. Right? Like, I could help so many people,

161
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:36,177
and it also brings up

162
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:38,734
the episode of the good place

163
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:39,613
when

164
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:42,610
ta Huey, and Jason just walk around

165
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:43,544
Sydney

166
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:50,603
and just give away money. Just for the sake of giving it away. That was the fun one? It... And it...

167
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:52,676
It was just... It just

168
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,850
illustrated. It in that in that episode it was illustrating what beautiful selfless

169
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,630
finally?

170
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:00,704
People

171
00:12:01,163 --> 00:12:02,942
they had grown into...

172
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,339
Oh god

173
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:08,735
in this episode. In this comic

174
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:12,906
It's just in line more with

175
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:15,362
Scrooge pink screwed.

176
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,800
Right. And Donald being donald.

177
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:24,186
And Donald being donna. Yeah And it's very much played for Gladstone. And I and I think very successfully.

178
00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:31,800
But But, yeah, I think I think that's this is gonna be a big part of why this story works. Right? Because this is a fun thought

179
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,092
exercise in if you had to spend a bunch of...

180
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:38,010
Someone else's money,

181
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:43,659
how would you do it? And and donald goes about it in this pretty ridiculous way.

182
00:12:44,237 --> 00:12:48,289
And and that's gonna be most of the rest of this story.

183
00:12:48,707 --> 00:12:51,681
Right? It's it's very light. It's very fluffy

184
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:55,251
we get to watch Donald Scrooge and the Nephews

185
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,329
go on this really

186
00:12:57,908 --> 00:12:58,408
extravagant

187
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:00,726
road trip around the country

188
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:10,665
spending money, and and we don't need to think about the fact that Scrooge is joining in. Right? Like, we need him there for the comedy of it, even if you shouldn't

189
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,039
logically, he shouldn't be along.

190
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:17,529
But but it's it's just a very fun funny

191
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:18,345
size.

192
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,834
And so Donald sets out with a literal wheel wheelbarrow full of cash.

193
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:29,142
I I just love screws is agonizing look. As Donald

194
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:34,161
pushes the wheel wheelbarrow through the town with... With all these go.

195
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:44,543
So staring at as you would expect, you know? And and we're gonna get this pattern where Scrooge points out a very frugal little cherry Al a very reasonably

196
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:45,235
priced

197
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:52,035
little car, and Donald ignores them and says, I'm spending this money. And he points to this

198
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:52,875
chemically

199
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:58,593
overpriced the luxury surety vehicle, a road v twenty four.

200
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:05,271
Do you wanna tell when what is the sn salesman say is the cost?

201
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:08,069
Fifty thousand dollars as is.

202
00:14:08,568 --> 00:14:11,345
But if you wanna upgrade to Urban

203
00:14:12,338 --> 00:14:13,197
Seat covers.

204
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:15,410
It's a hundred of dollars.

205
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:16,328
Right.

206
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:21,911
And so Donald dumps the bearer and tells him to to count it from this heat.

207
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:29,475
And they perceived to buy a fancy trailer to haul the rest of the money and for their their big extravagant road trip.

208
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,710
And they pick up the nephews.

209
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,750
And, again, we see this

210
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,050
exchange for their their first meal.

211
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:42,001
Where Scrooge points out a very frugal little bean

212
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:43,119
with

213
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:46,076
burgers that cost only twenty cents

214
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:50,838
and Donald pulls up to a very fancy restaurant

215
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:58,435
saying, it would take you forever to spend that trailer load of money on until Through. Willie here.

216
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:02,035
And Sarah beforehand you and I were pointing out that

217
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,530
the restaurant there a name that would be

218
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:07,966
considered offensive nowadays

219
00:15:08,703 --> 00:15:10,400
with the the word gi

220
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:13,474
which was just, like in common

221
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:15,725
use at this time.

222
00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:22,725
It's called the old chip in again, that's not something. That's that's something that we've just collectively

223
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:26,751
most people have moved on from using that term. Right.

224
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:30,444
And and I really like all the interactions

225
00:15:30,782 --> 00:15:32,574
where Donald is a extravagant

226
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:37,438
ordering things, like from the restaurant. Do you wanna tell us what the order is what he orders?

227
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:40,880
Five double orders of

228
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:41,879
bro

229
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:42,937
of Al.

230
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:46,793
Including everything

231
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:48,290
from soup to nuts.

232
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:53,707
And the waiter asked if you wants whipped cream on the nuts, and he says

233
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:56,115
Yes. Topped off with a cherry.

234
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:02,510
And and went told that the cherries will be five dollars x tells them to to put on a handful.

235
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:12,000
And And and this is how the stories gonna go. You know, They invite a bunch of the junior wood checks in for this fancy meal when they see them

236
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:24,501
Scrooge is just as hard as breaking. Right? After they leave, he says I admit you're spending that money nephew. But do you have to be quite so extravagant

237
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,456
and he just, you know, he has to accept this, basically.

238
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:38,090
And and I love... I love what Donald says about the card. Do you wanna tell us about the car on the next page? There's a bug spot.

239
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:39,801
On the win windshield.

240
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:42,233
So they're going to

241
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,925
buy another car.

242
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,078
Just like that one,

243
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:48,549
but with rabbit

244
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:50,546
died to look like

245
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:56,555
herman, which is much much better. Right. Because it's another hundred thousand tall unisex.

246
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:04,007
And and they passed this character picture of a very poor person who's kind of in like a a

247
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,599
he's supposed to look like a hi billy, I think.

248
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:14,393
And Donald notices he doesn't have any shoes, and he toss him some money for a dozen pairs,

249
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:19,143
and the man just pla keeps listing all these extended family members.

250
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,423
And and it's it's a funny Al little bit, but it's based the guys at at the expense of people who

251
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:27,700
are stereotypes

252
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,510
to be like hi abilities with with very large families.

253
00:17:32,205 --> 00:17:36,385
Right? So the punch line is is that this year would be a some country

254
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:45,013
to sell birthday cards. See, that one didn't make sense to me, but now now that you explain it, okay. Yeah. I get it now.

255
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:53,185
Right. No That's that's a cute joke. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's a it's a silly joke Al at poor folks with large families.

256
00:17:54,225 --> 00:18:00,096
And and then there's another kind of joke on their road trip where they passed, like a a tourist,

257
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:05,430
a tourist stop where they're a native American selling quote Indian silver tri.

258
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:06,983
And,

259
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,699
you know, it's it's a very stereotype

260
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:12,336
representation of a couple of native Americans

261
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:20,610
who've priced their tri at ten cents each. But when they see these rich tourists coming, they raised the price.

262
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:31,260
They jacked the price up to ten dollars per tri. You know, Donald doesn't care. This is all the better for donald. Right? Oh, yeah. I mean, if you can't give him their land, then

263
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,000
might as well just give them a shit ton of money.

264
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:40,034
Right. And and, you know, Barb does this frequently. He definitely has these, like kara

265
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:41,031
versions

266
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:43,703
of native Americans, but he also

267
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:53,754
I've noticed that he really likes to show them getting one over on quote like people. Right? Because, you know, we know that the docs code is being, like, white

268
00:18:54,553 --> 00:18:56,750
Space. They're the default, which is white.

269
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:57,984
Right.

270
00:18:58,443 --> 00:19:06,175
And and I love it when they transition to the blue mountains and tunnel to size up. Gotta get a new car to match the landscape.

271
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,750
I think I think the story is very successful,

272
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:24,279
and it he keeps hammering this this comic be home. Right, these ridiculous over the top extravagant ways to spend money. And the Ducktales finally finished their road trip six days and seven

273
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:26,000
automobiles later.

274
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:38,926
And they're all just exhausted. And I like Donald asking them about kinda of their last meal before they wrap it up. Do you wanna tell me what he asks them? Can you eat anymore? Bro

275
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:40,898
of Al and chick.

276
00:19:41,954 --> 00:19:43,909
And they're all just outraged. No.

277
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:45,167
No.

278
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:52,840
They finally do visit. Very down home bean or they can get thirty cent piece burgers.

279
00:19:53,297 --> 00:20:07,482
Donald kind of be moons, can't you wrap them in gold leaf to make them expensive. And and they do it. You know, they've finally managed to spend all the money and they head home a job well done and Scrooge has

280
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:28,200
Donald come up to his office to pay him Al wages, and he's just thinking himself and I was never through worst torture my life. Thank goodness it's over. And do you wanna tell us Sarah how the story wraps up? Well, it turns out there are several more bags of money waiting for him. Yeah because and Scrooge

281
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,216
protests, but I just finished

282
00:20:30,553 --> 00:20:31,053
spending

283
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:39,122
a big pot a pile like that. And then the Clerk says but some spent thrifty billion has been touring the country

284
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,930
staying in your expensive hotels.

285
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:51,565
Eating chick in your expensive restaurant restaurants, buying road hog Barks which are made in your factory buying your urban sea covers

286
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,496
from your urban farms,

287
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:59,321
your few factories have been working over overtime. And here comes another sack full of money

288
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:13,973
from your silver minds down in the Indian country. And we get one of those great Barks like reaction drawings where it kind of don's on Scrooge. What has happened? You know? He spent all this money only for it to circulate

289
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,568
through the economy

290
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:17,681
right back up

291
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:21,655
to him because the box stops with him, basically.

292
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:24,055
And we get this funny comic

293
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:31,350
copper gag at the end. Where he asked the clerk of his cane came from one of his chain factories,

294
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,770
and when told that... No, you don't own Al

295
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:45,555
fact. He he chases donald off intending to cal him with it saying Good. I just got a hunch. I'll be needing a new one in about ten seconds.

296
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:47,146
So

297
00:21:47,643 --> 00:21:53,781
that story is very well constructed. Just like the financial favor. Right?

298
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:57,448
It has this. It's a very

299
00:21:58,465 --> 00:21:58,824
story.

300
00:21:59,303 --> 00:22:11,681
We we end up exactly where we start out. He he has this very consistent theme that he is maintaining throughout the story. It's it's less moral.

301
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:20,905
In this one that it is in a financial favor. But he keeps up with that comic through line, and this very consistent and to me very funny way.

302
00:22:21,998 --> 00:22:37,097
Just like a financial favor, it it only falls apart for me when you actually think about like the economics of what he's implying And like, I'm sure that there are people listening Sarah who are ticked off that, like I'm getting

303
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:46,845
I'm getting political with this. So what I would argue, this is a very political story. Right? This this story is taking the position

304
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:47,962
that

305
00:22:49,175 --> 00:22:49,675
spending

306
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:51,308
by the rich

307
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:56,590
drives the economy. And and that like... That's what Ronald Reagan

308
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,510
basically

309
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:03,124
steak to presidency on. Right? And and that is is a huge part of

310
00:23:03,703 --> 00:23:07,439
what I would argue is what's wrong with with the American

311
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:10,795
economy. Right. Are you in a huge a huge

312
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:17,185
portion of what's going on right now is the wage stag nation basically since the Reagan

313
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:17,840
administration.

314
00:23:18,574 --> 00:23:22,829
And in order for... In order for Scrooge to have gotten

315
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:37,385
so much of his money back, he would have needed to not be paying his workers very much. And that's, of course, not addressed at all. By you know, for for comedy sake, you know? We overs simplify these things. But it...

316
00:23:37,805 --> 00:23:40,825
I can only make noises. That's how frustrating. I I.

317
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:45,198
It's It's just frustrating

318
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:46,157
how

319
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:49,952
this story is one of the kind of

320
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:51,590
pro

321
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:52,443
wealth

322
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,037
accumulation stories

323
00:23:54,573 --> 00:24:03,905
that we get starting uncle Scrooge. Yeah. Because, like, Both of these stories, you know, the the previous one that we did, financial,

324
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:13,035
and this one, they both like are taking the top that At the end, it is reverting to the status quo to the default. The rich

325
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:16,250
supposed to be rich, his money just

326
00:24:16,828 --> 00:24:17,328
naturally

327
00:24:17,984 --> 00:24:28,795
flows back to them. And and for this one, I do have a real problem with the idea that, like everything that he spent comes back to him. Right? Like that that

328
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:31,155
buried in there is the assumption

329
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:32,915
that his money

330
00:24:33,335 --> 00:24:33,835
compounded.

331
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:48,279
In a way that economically, it really wouldn't. Right? And and I accept that this is done to simplify the story and and to make it funny. Right? And and I actually think it works. Like, very well.

332
00:24:49,318 --> 00:24:57,891
It is structured. Barks gets to make his own watch. For these stories. Right? Like, I I accept that. And I I think this is very successful

333
00:24:58,507 --> 00:25:01,892
story. I think it's very funny. Like financial.

334
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:09,547
I love this story. I think it's great. It just... It does have that part of it. That that rings

335
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:11,960
a little bit false for me

336
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:13,960
that I that I just find

337
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:14,840
philosophically

338
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,934
I'm sure that there are a lot of people who would say, well, you know, that this is just how this is how

339
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:31,950
the world works and and economics works. But but I would say no. That's wrong. You know, the these stories do have it wrong. He is presenting

340
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:32,830
these

341
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:45,058
concepts as though there like laws of economics and that's not actually how it works. And and this is just part of, like, this is part of why why I'm doing this podcast. You know?

342
00:25:45,975 --> 00:25:57,815
That because I I I love these stories and I want to celebrate them. I wanna recognize their genius, and there are street, but they were so foundational for me. I also wanna be really thoughtful

343
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:01,206
about some of the, like, messed up ideas

344
00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:02,975
around the culture,

345
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:07,956
including the... Some of the old racist ideas and the

346
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:10,242
economically

347
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,678
un sound

348
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:13,770
ideas that he presents.

349
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:17,460
So... Right. That's that's a lot to just kind of

350
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:21,223
stuff. Well, I I know that your listeners

351
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:24,612
tend to skew canned.

352
00:26:25,268 --> 00:26:30,455
And so I think you'll find a lot of agreement there. Yeah. That's that's true. Right? Because

353
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:45,562
it's weird. Right? Barks fans are either. People who are reading these in in the forties fifties and sixty. So a lot of them are are older and a little bit more politically and economically conservative. I've definitely heard from some people

354
00:26:46,034 --> 00:26:46,534
who

355
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:50,294
disagree with me on, you know, kind of focusing

356
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:54,467
on some of these problematic elements. But I I really appreciate

357
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:56,503
that they're willing to listen

358
00:26:56,841 --> 00:27:06,611
and engage with the podcast even if we don't like. Even if we disagree on the utility of thinking about these things. So I definitely have that kind of listener. Then there are definitely

359
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:07,568
more

360
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:10,796
younger listeners who have discovered these stories

361
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,929
like, during the time frame I had. And and you're right. A lot of the listeners

362
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,705
from Europe is especially scanned

363
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:19,625
probably

364
00:27:19,965 --> 00:27:21,825
grew up in economies

365
00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:25,945
that are like mixed that, you know, they're there's still capitalist

366
00:27:26,737 --> 00:27:30,827
economies, but they definitely have this, like, democratic socialism

367
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:35,433
that that is more focused on kind of societal well.

368
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:48,912
And and it... That's another thing that really fa me is that there are all these, like huge fans of Carl Barks. From Norway and Sweden and Denmark and in Finland and and so on Netherlands

369
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,590
and in Germany

370
00:27:51,262 --> 00:27:52,896
West and Northern Europe,

371
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:53,954
especially,

372
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:55,327
love Barks

373
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:59,789
and yet so many of the ideas of Barks, are really

374
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:07,145
hypothetical to, like those societies. And that just fascinated me. Well, it fa me that

375
00:28:07,961 --> 00:28:10,254
for the same reason, right of your

376
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:22,351
love of these, your devotion of to these. Right? Because I know how you believe politically and you showed none of the signs of taking in a lot of these

377
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:25,195
political messages or these economic messages.

378
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:38,775
And and the fact that you've started this to kind of re examine and Those ideas while being while consuming them at such a form age. Right? Like, you're kind of emblem mba of those

379
00:28:39,114 --> 00:28:43,007
listeners who are Bark fans, but still, you know, politically

380
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:44,084
fiscal

381
00:28:44,662 --> 00:28:57,940
blessed. Yeah. And I think there are many of us, and I I like to think that there are people who are willing to enjoy it on on multiple levels and and kinda be able to separate out aspects of it.

382
00:28:58,994 --> 00:29:08,610
And and I mean, all I can say is that I just I find his his art and his riding and the universities created

383
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:13,113
so appealing. And so clever and and Intriguing

384
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:14,842
it really does

385
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,177
override those, like,

386
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:17,515
reservations

387
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:21,958
that I have about some of these aspects. And honestly,

388
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:24,991
I I think that low

389
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:28,902
people do not appreciate what an incredible

390
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:31,752
mirror for, like American

391
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:32,871
history

392
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,245
between the the late forties through the mid sixties. If you like think about Barks,

393
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:43,670
kind of his his overall work. Right? He had hundreds of these stories.

394
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:48,360
They talked about pop culture. They talked about venturing around the world.

395
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:54,577
They've talked about just all these American ideas. I think it's one of the best

396
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,767
representations. If you wanted to give, like, an alien

397
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:11,646
an idea of what American culture was like between nineteen forty four and nineteen, like sixty whenever he kind of went into his pseudo retirement. You could do a lot worse

398
00:30:12,223 --> 00:30:21,573
than, like, having him sit down and read all the Barks stories. Well, also explaining that yes, most people are not three and a half foot tall talking dumps.

399
00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:40,920
But, yeah. Those are those are kind of the reasons why I'm just endlessly fascinated by these stories. And and I I love them so much. I'd I really do. Then and it should be said that they're not all, you know, he he was a complex man. Right? I think I told you. He's not like purely

400
00:30:41,474 --> 00:30:44,810
a a retro grade reactionary. He has some fascinating

401
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:47,846
politics. Like, the man was Al isolation.

402
00:30:48,878 --> 00:30:53,569
Even even into World war two, you know, he was a a big non intervention.

403
00:30:53,987 --> 00:30:57,580
So I think there was a little bit of a manifest element to that too.

404
00:30:58,155 --> 00:30:58,655
He

405
00:30:59,155 --> 00:30:59,655
certainly

406
00:31:00,195 --> 00:31:02,155
believed in supply side economics.

407
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:03,615
But he also...

408
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:08,907
Like, you can see in the later part of his career, he was up big time and environment.

409
00:31:09,644 --> 00:31:09,924
Mh.

410
00:31:10,562 --> 00:31:16,171
And like, those two things don't really go to kevin. Fool, they they don't now

411
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:17,823
but they

412
00:31:18,362 --> 00:31:21,499
very well could have back then. The the political

413
00:31:21,998 --> 00:31:22,498
platforms

414
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:27,462
of the respective parties were so much different and as as America

415
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,794
got pulled more and more to the right,

416
00:31:30,512 --> 00:31:34,521
despite the evidence of how supply side economics

417
00:31:34,953 --> 00:31:44,597
effects wages and the country. You know, he... I feel like he was more in that, like, starry, hey, this is a good idea where we're in this boom time

418
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:47,928
and, you know, maybe this will be a good thing.

419
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:49,266
Whereas,

420
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:49,764
you know,

421
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:53,153
later on, it just turned out to be

422
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,028
fitting, the wealthy,

423
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:59,376
and then we started getting propaganda to defend the wealthy

424
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,788
and more and more people who

425
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:03,426
were not prosper

426
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:11,552
in the way that they were in the post war, but we're still able to be convinced to vote against their interests. Right? Whereas

427
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:12,431
they

428
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:23,320
they were so early in the supply side experiment that they didn't even know that it was in their interest. I think at that time. And so they could be a lot more

429
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,840
progressive on

430
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,800
some issues because they didn't see

431
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:29,771
how it would threaten

432
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:30,769
the

433
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:31,966
ideology

434
00:32:32,543 --> 00:32:34,678
of the of their economic

435
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:42,290
desires. I guess. Yeah. I mean, I think that's right. Like, things have gotten so polarized that people like naturally

436
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:54,324
assume this belief has to go with this belief and so forth and and and and that's a good way of really dividing and conquering people. And and I don't know. Maybe

437
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:58,626
maybe the creation of Scrooge is is a good like money laundering

438
00:32:59,082 --> 00:32:59,582
for

439
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:05,502
for Ty goo and the acceptance of Ty goo except that he's not always

440
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:14,296
he's not always the hero. But. I don't know. So let let's see. I I wanna talk a a little bit about how

441
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:20,998
both of these stories do this really neat thing that Barks does memorable a few times. Right?

442
00:33:21,718 --> 00:33:25,830
And this is likely gonna be a two partners. So I'm I'm talking about our previous

443
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,670
episode about Scrooge Genomics

444
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,730
where we talked about a financial table as well as spending money.

445
00:33:32,464 --> 00:33:41,537
What they both do, they're they have... There's a lot of similar threats. But what I really like is that they're both these, like closed experiments. Right? He creates

446
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:47,828
his own little economic experiments and watches them play out in a way that's very like,

447
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:49,763
to me and

448
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:54,762
It kinda reveals how he thinks the world works. And it's also a really

449
00:33:55,139 --> 00:34:01,520
invent and interesting story. And he kinda does this as well in that famous trouble with Dimes,

450
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,940
you know, where he like has Scrooge

451
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,120
manufacture,

452
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,400
scarcity.

453
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,000
That Al is just an incredible

454
00:34:09,435 --> 00:34:12,252
I don't think there's any of these, like, problematic elements

455
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,008
with that one either. It's just an incredible

456
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,578
exploration of scarcity and kind of as early discussed with collectors.

457
00:34:20,156 --> 00:34:30,465
Mh. I mentioned at the time I recorded that episode that it would... It would be fascinated to see what he thought of the prices that his paintings and original comics fetch now.

458
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:33,819
Oh... That's exactly where my brain went. Yeah.

459
00:34:34,817 --> 00:34:43,275
Because he was... It it already blew his mind when he was able to sell some paintings into the hundreds. But now, you know, of course, those, like, they they can go into the

460
00:34:43,854 --> 00:34:44,994
scores of thousands.

461
00:34:45,772 --> 00:34:56,552
And and we have a few more examples. You know, I recently got to do an example. I I got to do an episode for T a famous bottle cap story. They attempted that one into a duck

462
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:06,035
episode. I'm not sure if you ever got to see that one. But... No. I don't think so. Yeah it's just, you know, there's that lost value of people who

463
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:20,435
I think it's interesting that as these there is that it's the metal and the money that corrupt the people that they're they're actually pure without it. So it's it's just another example of one of these kind of closed experiments.

464
00:35:20,895 --> 00:35:32,085
He does. And then the last one, we're not gonna go into big detail on this that he did do this really cool five pager. Did you notice how risk this story called

465
00:35:32,743 --> 00:35:41,756
there's something fishy here was Sarah. It was so small that you could just email me pages just straight in the email. Right.

466
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:52,655
And this one is cool because, like, it is one of the examples of a five page story that really left a Barks people. If you look it up on Inducks,

467
00:35:52,695 --> 00:35:56,064
it is very well regarded. It was published

468
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,870
alongside the very famous

469
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:04,870
one shot story back to the lawn and floor cover four hundred and fifty six January of nineteen

470
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:05,845
fifty

471
00:36:06,304 --> 00:36:07,483
four, and

472
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:14,215
it's got a rank of seven point five. Good for number two hundred and fifty five out of all the stories.

473
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:23,192
It's by far the highest ranked story of that very short length. So I I think it's a notable little accomplishment

474
00:36:23,585 --> 00:36:30,311
that he was able to construct something so memorable. And and again, it's this very funny

475
00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:32,467
experiment where donald.

476
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,700
Wants to play this prank. On Scrooge.

477
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:41,940
What do you wanna tell us what the prank is Sarah? Donald convince is Scrooge

478
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:45,495
that congress has decided that currency

479
00:36:46,155 --> 00:36:48,215
will switch from dollars

480
00:36:48,795 --> 00:36:49,755
to fishy.

481
00:36:50,690 --> 00:37:03,306
It's so over the top and and again, cartoon logic, this one falls apart. But, you know, I'm willing to go along for the ride with this one just because of how outrageous it is. And and the whole

482
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:07,110
of this story is that Scrooge is so

483
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,750
he is such a good ty.

484
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,630
He's such a good industrial

485
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:12,910
that

486
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:23,855
starting from nothing within just a couple of days, he is able to, like, Barks up from a couple of fish into his whole

487
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:24,733
mountain

488
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:28,141
of of fishy money again. Mh.

489
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:41,045
And and again, it's like that myth of the protestant work ethic. Right? Scrooge is able to do this in the course of of a day, I believe. And it has this very funny ending

490
00:37:41,439 --> 00:38:05,778
where, you know, he... He's realizing that you are talking about the joy, right, that he gets from diving and his money. But pretty easy to sympathize sarah with why he wouldn't wanna dive through his new fishy fortune. Right. And I found it so interesting again with the stereotype that I'd had had carried over from watching Ducktales and now reading a few of these fruit comics

491
00:38:06,156 --> 00:38:06,656
where

492
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:19,710
sp was greedy for the sake of having money. When he's decided like, you know, this fish currency is not my bag. I don't wanna be rich anymore. I'm gonna give it all donald,

493
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:29,085
you know, you know, for ob reasons because nobody wants to forward fish, let them alone like it's not as fun to swim around and like, clovis.

494
00:38:29,702 --> 00:38:30,202
Right.

495
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:36,947
Yeah. And again, it's all very broad over the top and ridiculous. But it makes for a great ending.

496
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:46,560
As Donald comes back to find that his house is like, in engulfed in this pile of fish that sp has like sold to a trucker

497
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:50,349
partially in exchange for

498
00:38:50,726 --> 00:38:55,630
dropping them off to Donald and the Nephews are able to to say...

499
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:04,842
And and with the fish came a note from An Scrooge. It says well, never mind what it says. Your dad

500
00:39:05,419 --> 00:39:05,919
fired.

501
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:09,864
It it's again. Just a very well

502
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:11,817
constructed gag story

503
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,110
that's very breezy very funny.

504
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,410
And again,

505
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,670
underlying it is this like, interesting

506
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:20,710
assumption

507
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:29,895
that he makes about about Scrooge being such an exceptional man that he can do the rag to riches things thing.

508
00:39:30,588 --> 00:39:41,241
Again at the age of, you know, seventy five or eighty or or whatever he is in the span of the day. Right. Because it's you know, like, it's not necessarily the hard work. It's the

509
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:48,044
the the good decisions you can make. Right? I remember there's an episode of thirty rock where

510
00:39:48,422 --> 00:39:49,819
the Ceo of

511
00:39:51,016 --> 00:40:12,421
Got fired because somebody else took over the network of the ceo but the jack Don whatever I don't know what he what his position was. So he just... But he decided he didn't wanna leave and be so he started Barks back in the mail room, and he's like, last time it took me this many years to get up to my position as an executive But this time, I think I'll I can

512
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:14,855
I can whittle it down to, like, nine,

513
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:16,411
You know, learning

514
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:28,935
using what he learned? Right. Along the way the first time, and it's it's this myth that America Loves to tell itself over and over. Right. And and and self made men

515
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:30,815
and women definitely

516
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:50,277
exist, but but much more common are the people who, like band themselves as self made. And then if you look into their backstory, you realize, oh, while I was working in in the garage on my start up. I got a seed loan from my Ceo father of five hundred thousand dollars

517
00:40:50,694 --> 00:40:54,160
that that I had to pay back under Sweetheart terms. And...

518
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:59,234
But but people love this stuff. I love this stuff. Right? Like.

519
00:41:00,172 --> 00:41:10,739
This... I loved reading these. Stories. And I still do. It's such a it's such a weird dynamic. Yeah. I think it's... I think it's a skill to be able to

520
00:41:11,117 --> 00:41:29,487
know what right and what is more beneficial, but still, you know, see that see the fun in this kind of thing without internal the message. Yeah. One thing I wanted to go back to was my thoughts about when Scrooge was giving donald the fish.

521
00:41:30,299 --> 00:41:31,876
Mh. I thought it was interesting

522
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,149
that he didn't trade the fish

523
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:39,751
for anything that he wanted. And he didn't just give the fish to, you know, whoever.

524
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:46,852
He gave it to Donald, you know, as his heir, and it it was kind of a sweet moment in the midst of all of the

525
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:56,540
other times when he's been created. He doesn't want Donald to have any of his money right? That he's like, okay. Well, here's this thing that I've decided is now worthless.

526
00:41:57,094 --> 00:42:08,007
I'm am going to give it to donald and not expect anything of. I'm not gonna give it to somebody else. I'm not gonna trade it for something better. I'm just gonna give it to Donald. Out of the warmth of my heart.

527
00:42:08,766 --> 00:42:15,830
Because he wasn't in on the gag. Yeah. I know I totally agree. It's it's a little bit It's a little bit touching,

528
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,582
but of course, it also

529
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:18,419
benefits

530
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:20,906
our setup up because Oh, yeah.

531
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:29,034
Because it's got a backfire on Don. He... He loves it. He likes to have prank. Backfire.

532
00:42:29,452 --> 00:42:37,050
That's very satisfying to read. Yes. So I I really have been looking forward to recording this

533
00:42:37,507 --> 00:42:38,007
series

534
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:51,689
for a while. This these are a couple of big stories to consider even if they're Al little ten pager. And I really appreciate you joining me for them. I think I think that they're among the most fascinating

535
00:42:52,427 --> 00:42:52,927
and

536
00:42:53,386 --> 00:42:53,865
revealing.

537
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:02,700
Of the stories the Barks ever did about kind of like his worldview and what what he thought about wealth and and money and finance.

538
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,213
It's also an excellent snapshot

539
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:06,252
of

540
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:12,185
the kind of prevailing thought of, you know, the middle class of the time.

541
00:43:12,879 --> 00:43:15,292
About wealth. Yeah. For sure.

542
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,123
So so thanks again, Sarah. I

543
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,758

545
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:37,471
Will we'll fall into it. And you can go to the world. And I hope that someday, you have a rich great uncle or uncle

546
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:42,232
