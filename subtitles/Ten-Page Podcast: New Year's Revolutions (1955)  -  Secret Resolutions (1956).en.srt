00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:29,483
So happy New Year two Warren Harmon and Patrick Block. It's great to to hear and see you guys again. It's they'd to be back for New year. We new year Barks. Yeah. It's going to be back to with two fellow duck fans and and this is gonna be fun. Yeah. Looking forward to it. Right on. So you guys are you

12
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:35,884
first off? Let's see Patrick. Are you are you like a new Year's resolution kind guy? Do you make resolution

13
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:52,011
absolutely not. You know, at the end of the year, I'll like clean up my my art room and three rearrange my books and put my old mail away, and that's about of it. The resolution. Very nice. And in patrick, you are, of course Al extremely well regarded Inducks artist who does

14
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,850
paintings

15
00:01:53,325 --> 00:01:57,624
as well and and a long time Barks fan. Is is there anything

16
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:06,034
interesting that you've been up to recently that you'd like to mention? We were just in Copenhagen Denmark for a big book event book

17
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:07,392
signing and

18
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,470
signing

19
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:24,614
Plus or or gallery and neil treated us great. With this family. We had a good time. It's got to the point where they're like they're very much, like family there. We enjoy the trip so much. Get to walk around Cup copenhagen and take a few extra days, you know, walk Al beautiful city. It's like the previous one of the prettiest

20
00:02:24,952 --> 00:02:38,486
big cities in the world. That's awesome. It's isn't it nice that the cons are, like, getting back into this kind of things? It is. It's very neat. It was kinda there for a while. Yeah. Oh, I know. I I got to go to Baltimore

21
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:52,489
recently for the first time because my my previous con base was Phoenix. Fan fest. But but I got to see a few a few people in the doc community. I got Don Rose there. And I got see Kim Weston.

22
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:55,845
Yeah. Alright. Awesome

23
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,481
Again, welcome back patrick. How about you warren

24
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:01,893
are you... Are you a New Year's

25
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:12,777
resolution kinda guy? Well, the older I get certainly, I... I'm wiser now, and I know that the more resolutions I make the moral break. So I I have decided to maybe make one or two

26
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:34,070
but here's my rule for it. I have to start practicing that resolve behavior at the least two months in the previous year in order for me to have a really great confidence, you know, that I'm gonna make it. So yes. I do. I I have in the past as a family we used to do it. But in inadvertently, it would okay would... They would fail after three months. So, you know, Sure. Leading Pat method here.

27
00:03:35,284 --> 00:03:40,858
Well, and I'm guessing, I'm guessing that neither of you do the advisable thing of

28
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:43,095
challenging other people

29
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:48,774
to a penalty if you break your resolution because... Because that seems like a recipe

30
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:49,611
for

31
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:50,488
disaster

32
00:03:51,144 --> 00:04:09,582
but but maybe funny disaster. And learned for Uncle. Carl to do that. That's right. That's right. No. I the whole idea of a forfeit was new to me and I... I I will never never ever give that the ability to my family. Yeah. That that makes sense. For for my own part, I'm not a huge resolutions guy. I'll

33
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:16,354
kicking around the idea of one, but I did make one last year that I have actually

34
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:32,405
stuck with. I'm so proud of myself. I... My my wife is always offering to make me salad. And I resolved to say yes to salad it. So now anytime she offers to make me a salad, I say yes, and I eat the salad, and and it's been great.

35
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:43,243
Sounds vaguely familiar like a story where we talk about. Yeah. Little food theme going. Little a little food seemed a little bit healthier though. So you guys...

36
00:04:43,581 --> 00:05:02,707
This is an the ten page podcast, which are a little bit more relaxed and a little bit less reese search, but we are gonna do a little bit of background on the two stories that we'll be talking about today. We are covering the only two new Year's themes stories that Barks did, which are

37
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:03,983
new Year's

38
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:04,980
revolutions

39
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:21,259
that was published in Walt disney disease comments and stories number one hundred and seventy three. And if the cover date was February of nineteen fifty five, but of course, it it was released in time for to to be, you know, New year's relevant.

40
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:27,645
And then we're gonna do Karl follow ups from one year later, which was secret

41
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:28,602
resolutions

42
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,797
in the same title

43
00:05:31,654 --> 00:05:34,364
number one hundred and eighty five

44
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:39,707
exactly a year later in feb cover date of February nineteen fifty six. And,

45
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:44,070
you know, Patrick you pointed out that well, the user the only two

46
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:59,357
New Year's themed stories. He has done some other, like, resolution stories. Yes. You know, it sounds like a noble idea for donald to resolve to do so many things, and it's just a recipe for disaster that you know, is gonna follow. So Carl gotta have that in his index cards

47
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:04,598
things. I feel there's always a couple of, like, earlier stories

48
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:09,541
Oh, is it, like, three dirty docks or something at date time? It's it three yeah

49
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:18,145
Yeah. That... That's a... That's a really fun classic one too. Maybe maybe I we can cover that next year around this time. But

50
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,660
but you know, I think it's really appropriate to stick with the holiday themed stories.

51
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,654
You guys these are... We'll mention the rankings at the end, but it is note

52
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:32,369
that like, some of the holiday themed stories they're not

53
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:41,527
necessarily his strongest ones. But these are actually pretty well plot of by the community. So we'll we'll talk at the end about what

54
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:48,420
how they're regarded by fans on Inducks and then maybe we can check in and and see which one, the three of us.

55
00:06:48,818 --> 00:06:50,753
Things is the more successful

56
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,325
of these two stories.

57
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:59,400
Like a plan. Yeah. So gentlemen, I think that it makes the most sense to go chronological.

58
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:02,735
Right? Start with the earlier story...

59
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:04,655
Excuse me, New year's

60
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:15,440
revolution first Alright. So starting off, I'm gonna point out to you guys really quick that I'm... This is kinda of rare. My only copy of this one is a Wit po.

61
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:20,149
Like I guess that would have been on nineteen seventies. They're hard to find some of those.

62
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:29,515
Yeah. It it wasn't small. I It wasn't the the, like best of times for Disney comics I would say the Lit era. No. So pretty.

63
00:07:31,323 --> 00:07:44,430
So this one opens up this is a Carl Barks winter story. I really love to see the winter art that he does. And we've got Donald and the kids basically talking about the quote solemn resolutions

64
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:52,498
that the kids have made, and and it's starts out very up upbeat very like, noble before it's gonna inevitably

65
00:07:52,875 --> 00:08:03,930
send. The the kids are talking about how they are allowed to never be late for school again, you know, to to just go straight to school without any fuss around

66
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:05,105
And

67
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:06,565
Donald is, like,

68
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:07,865
unusually

69
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:15,158
pride of them. I would say, and this one he's talking about how... You know, what a great Oh, I like the quote the

70
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:17,955
Lincoln and washington and simplicity.

71
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:50,560
Patrick. Do you wanna... Do you wanna tell us Patrick the little quote that he gives them about how proud is. Yes. They they tell donald that they're never going be late for school again. He's that is a noble resolve. That is the kind of rugged hero that makes Lincoln and Washington's growing boys. I think that's like the best line in the story Yeah. Great. And pretty cute. Considering the time too it was such perfect timing for the popularity of those two presidents and in the in America, and they were frame pictures on my first grade classroom, and that was Al little bit later, but still

72
00:08:50,900 --> 00:09:02,262
I remember calling out Lincoln and Washington. Al beautiful yes you can feel like Carl... Curtains Carl Barks and a a level of sarcasm so you can question of that as well.

73
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:14,820
Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. He even he even gives them this nice warm pad on the head. This is about this is about the kind and most respectful he's gonna be in this whole story before it just ends.

74
00:09:15,593 --> 00:09:19,886
Kids have those cute hats on. Oh, is that great? I love their winter outfits.

75
00:09:20,424 --> 00:09:26,485
Again, have like that. And and then here's where it takes a very donald turn. He makes an

76
00:09:26,861 --> 00:09:27,361
advisable

77
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:57,839
value to never again lose his temper and Any you know, the kids warren they they respond exactly as you would expect. They do to this. You gonna tell us about it. Well, first of all, they they say what we're all thinking that that's impossible. Number two, they're literally concerned for his health. Because his blood pressure will go up the deal. He won't or survive if he doesn't blow his stack once in a while, so I love this part because you know right away. We're setting up for the story. Yeah those.

78
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:00,592
Yeah. This is the perfect setup for a character

79
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:04,320
Donald Duck, who is like best known for plumbing his top.

80
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:09,063
So on on the next page, the kids they

81
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,063
introduce the idea of the fourth fit. In case they break their promise.

82
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:31,420
And for whatever reason, they say that they'll pick... It's established the they'll pick mcdonald's for fit later. So so they agree that their penalty can be washing dishes for a whole month if they break their valve Donald again is very proud of them for this you know, noble

83
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,220
pledge.

84
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,060
What do you guys think of how how quickly

85
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,140
Donald

86
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:40,915
resolves to... Help them break their resolution.

87
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:51,872
Well, what what direct me first what struck me was that he's the good uncle at the beginning. And then he's suddenly on this incredibly what would you see him doing a lot of the stories.

88
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:59,586
One up shipping he's gonna be challenging them so that he that he wins and they lose and it it's so uncle like, you know, it's it's

89
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:10,800
It's it's now their pure in a way. So it happens pretty quickly. It's very abrupt. It is a little abrupt. It's it's it's a abrupt enough to me that I find it just a little bit jarring.

90
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:19,910
Okay. But, you know, I'll give it these ten pages, they he needs to get the action going pretty quickly. And and we do transition pretty quickly

91
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,230
to the Nephews

92
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:28,065
heading to school the next day. This is a really fun sequence. Do you do you wanna tell us about this one Patrick?

93
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:52,014
Really huge shot of them in snow escape, you know. That kinda scam bring along and doing results. Kinds of fun stuff and walking across the fence, and they see as giant bird tracks with apparently of Giant bird tracks on Creek bank and of course they're interested immediately. How could any kid not see tracks as big as them and not month to Al of them? One of them says, I wonder if to over must be ten feet tall a picture of the picture

94
00:11:52,392 --> 00:12:04,259
the acute picture of a big gigantic birds snip boot wires, phone wires, busy. I love it when... I love it when Barks kind of imagine these, like, fantastic creatures.

95
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:19,994
Those are great illustrations. Yeah. He tends to, like, make the images like, crown out the characters Al we'll always really a does that. Yeah. Way the image of the bird is so big that it's, like, pushing against the if pieces it's right. Well, as they imagine this feature that that is so well

96
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:21,310
described visually

97
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:22,707
immediately

98
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:29,760
Bark does the right thing he takes us to the orphanage income. You know, the well the children are and that's where the nephews

99
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:44,422
absolutely now must be the heroes of the story. And forget the New year's resolution, we better save Inducks. That that's what I str is instruct me as the as a perfect way to move the story along. Right. He introduces a little bit of steaks for them

100
00:12:45,359 --> 00:13:03,546
to to let them get sucker into what is gonna be an obvious ploy. Right. And and the orphanage makes donald look worse. Oh, if it makes it look horrible. Oh my god. Goodness. Right. And and it is worth noting here that, you know, Donald is is gonna make them late deliberately. They're completely within

101
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:04,875
their right

102
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:14,110
You know, like, it's it is if you saw bird tracks like this, anyone would have done, especially anyone craigslist enough not to think that they're being

103
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,910
sn by a mean call. Right.

104
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,950
So, you know, they they continue to follow these tracks, they

105
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:22,362
they kind of

106
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:29,310
reconcile that, you know, the ten minute warning bell that, you know, they can ignore it because this is a matter of life and death

107
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:41,505
And they kinda follow the tracks into what seems to be a little box canyon. And I like the touch guys that they don't seem to notice that they pass right under Donald fake bird legs.

108
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:45,725
And when they see them and are confused, he explains

109
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,420
Warren why don't you read

110
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,620
the the panel here when they ask what he's doing here Well, all donna is doing is perched high upon those bird legs that they're standing under

111
00:13:55,935 --> 00:14:08,704
and and he's just looking off smiling saying, just listening to the school bell as it's ringing, and that's the moment where the resolution was broken. Right. Because he has he has tricked to them.

112
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:14,532
And and and it... I think he's a reader here you really feel a sense

113
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,207
outrage for the new.

114
00:14:16,585 --> 00:14:27,226
Oh, this is how dare you donald. You just scared these boys after them. With this monster that they imagined. And and now you're you're you're just glowing in your your t.

115
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:33,703
Is And again, the kids have even cute had on this time. Oh, they got the stock Gladstone. Yeah. I little.

116
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:47,790
Yeah. I feel like Barks probably showed them extra cute just just for that little sympathy play here. Yeah. I think too. And does things like that. Yeah. So we transition pretty quickly to the Nephews taking their punishment,

117
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:50,817
you know, gru about Donald

118
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,470
trick. And

119
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,990
one of the nephews

120
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,350
gets an idea when it's mentioned

121
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:11,156
that they haven't dreamed up the four fit yet. And and so they do approach him later and they say that they're... The fourth is that I'll have to buy more dishes but specifically paper ones that they wouldn't have to wash.

122
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:27,260
It's a nice... It's a nice little clever comeback. I love Donald reaction though two to the fact that that what he just did. Now he's claiming that they're per him you know that. The they're cheating. They're don't. Come on. What that's persecution.

123
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:41,101
Right. So it's just typical donald to just make themselves And I also like the r where Donald is is like talking to himself and reassuring himself that he's gonna keep a good grip on his.

124
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:48,058
Yeah. You is I'll do it And And so we transitioned to the Nephews getting ready. They're kind of brainstorming

125
00:15:48,436 --> 00:16:00,250
how they can make him mad the way we expect that he would. And and they describe the thing that's gonna be the hook for the rest of this story that Donald thinks he is the best ski jumper in Duck.

126
00:16:00,710 --> 00:17:26,246
And and we have... And that's gonna be their angle for getting them. And we've got this kind of interesting moment, guys where the nephews set apart a little bit, Barks doesn't usually kinda like, distinguish them. Right? They usually act as a unit. He immediately one though the reason is there is he needs that for the surprise ending sort of situation he likes me Barks always always tried to make the audience so that they didn't know how it was gonna no matter what I was like, a really important thing the decline is not... You couldn't figure it out on page one. And he doesn't introduce this it's well into the story, this the thing. There's no way you could guess what kids gonna do. Right exactly. Because because one of the Nephews says that's an idea. You too Youtube too man make him spill all over the hill, and I'll do the rest and it's really intriguing for the reader, isn't it. We find out it's Louie who who has this grander plan as as Patrick just mentioned and and now, yeah, Al a vehicle to move the story not only along and see how the skiing adventure turns out. We know something else is happening behind the scenes and we kinda forget about it during this than the next few panels would you like. Is that oh, yeah. We're is. Yeah. Yeah. I I like that too warren. I think you're right Barks has a real really neat way sometimes of introducing something and then taking the reader along, a different path enough so that it's kind of gone to the back of your mind, and it's all the are satisfying when he goes back to it. Yeah.

127
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,123
So, you know, the next few sequences

128
00:17:29,822 --> 00:17:34,055
are are basically gonna be the ways that the Nephews

129
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:42,740
mess with donald and is skiing and and the whole way that that he's doing it that they're doing it, Donald is is

130
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:43,578
successfully

131
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:49,734
maintaining his cool. Even though you can tell it's really trying to him.

132
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:59,980
Wet these coming off and... Yeah. I love the hash Barks head too. I mean, it's just and grading the petite then and it's just really wonderful art here. Yeah. What do you guys think about?

133
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,074
Anyone wanna call out kinda of their favorite moment in in the little sa skiing, sabotage

134
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:15,598
sequence... Well Barks is clover enough to use his uses giant feet with the leg phone legs were used earlier by dollar kids get to use them to sabotage

135
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:28,805
Donald he they stick them on the end of the skis so he's gonna lift to Inducks having try to walk down the hill on and doesn't work out a little. It's like a clever reference back to donald bad thing we. I really like that. Yeah.

136
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:34,861
I think that's my favorite too because of the return to the joke that sent them to wash dishes

137
00:18:35,678 --> 00:18:41,540
Retribution retribution right there, and there's so much back and forth revenge happening now, and it's just wonderful.

138
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:57,529
And and Mark, we pointed this out before. There's the classic rule of three here again. Yeah. You know where where there's the the tar, the birds in the bird legs and then the third one. Yeah. Right. And you chooses... Like them it tried tries to make it the funny one last. The bigger one last yeah it's the brand.

139
00:18:58,185 --> 00:19:03,045
Do it. Right. I really like... You're you're totally right about. It's it's nice poetic

140
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:11,065
retribution. You know, that they bring those legs back and it's so funny to see him, like w about on those. It's really great panel.

141
00:19:12,182 --> 00:19:18,125
And and Donald throughout this, you know, he he keeps up this facade. Of not being angry.

142
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:20,644
And and eventually,

143
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:44,011
the boys... Do you guys wanna mention anything else, I I don't know that I need to go too detailed into interesting how they can't break it, you know like with the regular the three gag, they eat Ducktales like because he seems like kinda crazy and the last with a pig, but he just not broke. He's not mad. And he's like hanging in there. And new disappointed about it. Well I got We got to the end of the last egg with the pig and and donald just joyful just laughing.

144
00:19:44,450 --> 00:20:01,111
While, he's doing this silly skiing down the hill with the pig dragging and we're carrying him. So I went back and I looked at the facial expressions from Huey, and Dewey, and I and I just love it... You're right, how they just built toward this incredible frustration if there's that... And and the panel I'm looking at is where

145
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:10,554
after the bird legs went into the snow and here weight underneath you... You don't see Donald, but the Joke on me again. I love the country of the fifth of one of the Nephews

146
00:20:11,014 --> 00:20:12,354
shot. Yeah. Sensitive

147
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:47,816
I'd be a wonderful to run down and little run and then there's two nephew standing the expressions are wonderful. Did you guys notice the panel where they they're talking about the props being set up for trick number two, One of the nephews says to the other, you know they are compare. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I had to look up That's like it's like a comp comp. Right? It's it's just it's not a very commonly used word. I find I found it interesting that Barks he he does such a nice job of trusting that his young readers are gonna, like, understand. In the second story, he does the same thing with the name of a dessert Right. Yes.

148
00:20:48,549 --> 00:21:06,617
Yes. I I like that too. And I'm glad you called that out because I went... That's not com. It's here. It's not pure. I haven't looked it up and, yeah, there you go. I mean, it's a word I had not used. Yeah. I was on the boat. Definitely. So, you know, the other two nephews, they they're they walk home and defeated.

149
00:21:06,956 --> 00:21:17,064
They've got these great expressions with their tongues hanging out. Yeah. And and they're kind of pondering what Louis was doing Al afternoon. As you mentioned warren, it's gonna turn out to be louis.

150
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:18,984
And and they're

151
00:21:19,324 --> 00:21:19,824
initially,

152
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:26,221
outraged when they see him coming home with Donald acting all chu. And he accused.

153
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:27,156
Yeah.

154
00:21:30,044 --> 00:21:31,904
Again, Bark is like

155
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:38,404
probably not a lot of kids know that that's a snake. Right? And they're calling him, like, a snake in the grass,

156
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,019
right.

157
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,679
Someone who's of the tray. But

158
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:49,958
so, you know, they said we've been working for hours to make him mad and he says, yeah, but I've been working

159
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:50,835
too

160
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:52,627
and he explains

161
00:21:52,980 --> 00:22:06,082
You wanna tell us warren what he explains why it was important that he do what he's gonna reveal. Sure. You know, he he acknowledged to his his brothers that you made him look like a monkey on skis, but no one else saw him. So

162
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:32,240
so he just left it off. Now I'll show you what I meant. When I told you not to worry about the dishes anymore. And he... And again, the reader is like, what did he do? You know, he wasn't there? Apparently. Right? And this is just I love this. I I absolutely love this twist. So... Yeah. He off and and has uncle donald does. Sit his favorite chair, and this got me. He turns on the Tv he's is your favorite Tv program so specific

163
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:34,159
were on skis.

164
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:48,574
And the last panel is great because the reader knows what's happened. The tone it does... Right. Preview the next page. It's like the bottom of that last panel it's wonderful because the fact that... I wonder who he is really ridiculous is. We know.

165
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:52,145
Yeah. Do you wanna tell us Patrick what the Tv announcer

166
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:53,102
announces

167
00:22:53,574 --> 00:23:03,910
Today, we have a surprise funny feature a movie real of the antics of Ducktales worst skier. And then even when he sees it's him, why that looks like me, he still doesn't I that.

168
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:06,790
He himself on the on the bird.

169
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,710
Garden bird monster

170
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,429
lakes. It is

171
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:18,717
disgrace for life this absolutely terrible. At this point, those reactions are all over the place when this last page. Because from, like, know outrage,

172
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:29,664
shop he sees the camera that does a louie really has. And then then then like a slow burn it gets very and bernie is it design done spirals. It's like quite wonderful.

173
00:23:30,705 --> 00:23:33,384
Inducks injury. It it it wasn't justine seen Inducks

174
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:40,398
he's holding up the cache. Yeah That's right. He's fully up the cash that says I sold it, like, the phone rights

175
00:23:40,895 --> 00:23:53,870
for worldwide broadcast and that's just... If that's another deal donald. I love it. Yeah. This is really fun. It's a it's a fun ending and and it really stands out to me too because of how our archaic it is.

176
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:58,441
Right? Because this is something that anyone could have done easily

177
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,689
today with the cell phone. That's.

178
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:07,107
Right But like, Louis holds up this room he had to rent a full on movie camera

179
00:24:08,295 --> 00:24:16,263
you know, we we know that it would take a lot longer than this to, like, sell the broadcast. Right? It's been in the context to this comic it works pretty well. Sure.

180
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:22,895
And and I like, that this is about the mattis we've seen Donald get in in some of these comments

181
00:24:23,249 --> 00:24:27,775
He's pretty. Yeah. He he chases them with, like, murder and his eyes.

182
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:41,098
And and it closes out with one and the after... The other and nephews saying you shouldn't have ported on so thick, Louis. Something tells me we'd have been better off washing the dishes. Yep Yeah. So it's a it's a classic

183
00:24:41,837 --> 00:24:43,616
threat of corporate punishment

184
00:24:44,314 --> 00:24:52,934
ending, which obviously isn't something you can do it today, but but it's pretty funny in the context of the time. Yeah Yep. So that that is our

185
00:24:53,312 --> 00:24:55,766
first of these new Year's stories.

186
00:24:56,103 --> 00:25:02,046
That I think this a lot of fun. I really enjoy this one. I do too. I I love the twists and I love the

187
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:19,480
expressions. And the artwork, I think, you know, Mark when when you and I were talking about the the last one I did with Sarah, something was wrong with the artwork there. It he's back informed now. I think. And and and and this is really nice. Yeah. Just one has some some great expressions.

188
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:47,045
It's a very domestic, you know, little little story and it works very well for it. It's fun seeing the docks in their winter gear and everything, you know, mixing it up a about. Yeah. It's a white fast story. I think the... I don't think that it's a money. Personally, I don't think it's these best stories. It's like very medium for Karl. Okay. What puts this is a meeting but carl stuff because medium stuff is better than anyone else is best stuff generally. So it's not relating so it's just... They can't all be. Number one. Right. Tier. Exactly.

189
00:25:47,805 --> 00:25:47,965
I mean,

190
00:25:48,737 --> 00:25:55,750
fifty percent, fifty percent of your stories are gonna be better than average and fifty percent are gonna be worse than your on average...

191
00:25:56,484 --> 00:26:03,298
Yeah. And it's, you know and Carl, I think Carl peak was like because the absolute peak and combination of the riding we are just like

192
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:24,761
somewhere between fifty fifty one. And then for me, he like sides a bit and then about fifty six fifty seven fifty eight is another peak for me. Story wise. And it's a really great one. This is kind of meeting between period for me. And the next story is just before it gets back into, like, a little gear. Thought I think that just in general, I prefer the second store and talk about that why that is shortly.

193
00:26:26,157 --> 00:26:44,790
Yeah. Yeah. We'll we'll get into it because I I think there are things I like about this story, but just not everything for me is as good as some of the other stuff. End strong. Mean, I I love help like that big panel he end the second the last panel mcdonald's really mad. Because buttons are huge. Looks like he gonna have, like, a stroke, you know. It's just like he's like really mad,

194
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,272
Right. Yeah. And they've mentioned is blood pressure before.

195
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,655
Yeah. Yeah. It's it's some pretty nice anger art.

196
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:54,606
Excellent. So

197
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:09,382
let's go on to to the next story that it sounds like you're pretty excited to talk about. Yeah. I know this next I'm I'm pretty excited to talk about this one as well. I'm gonna be reading from my issue of Disney,

198
00:27:10,517 --> 00:27:11,390
Disney comics

199
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:23,205
publication of this and Okay. While Disney Comments and stories five sixty nine just before I actually started doing stories that that particular comic but cannot just be just about just before I broke into the market.

200
00:27:23,845 --> 00:28:20,200
Yeah. Gladstone started re picked up after this after after Disney. Try kind of kind of went or his comments in general. Took a drop then, Gladstone picked up the comment again and I brought with my first. Yeah. I was gonna say to To my memory, you didn't you didn't have any stories during the Disney goose stuff. We tried to break into Disney through Disney through the mail. On the phone through the mail and got nowhere. We didn't get rejected. Again they get accepted. It was like it was passed around some the studio and knowing one we're make a decision And then disney... Glad picked it up back up and as the last ditch effort. We actually flew san diego Comic on, talked to John Clerk for ten minutes and he both the store it was are really weird. You know it it's like wasted a year, my life going to get published to disney. Wow. That's that's really interesting to hear. Yeah. So it was it was Glad stone two oh the. The second iteration of Gladstone, I think. Did did they publish all of the Disney comics that you did? No No Glad

201
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:28,000
Johnston did stories of linux. Okay. So you had some come out during the Gems era. And then, of course, E, is only

202
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:28,820
overseas.

203
00:28:29,234 --> 00:28:40,016
Yeah. They well... But but only being like, probably fifty times the comments are published here. So much much bigger Right. Right. I say only, but what I means

204
00:28:40,355 --> 00:28:54,136
they're not a domestic publisher that if if you were published... Yeah. Was like, publishing like be two hundred thousand Barks something that. So Europe like noise. Right. Just I think, know the point that we were doing month's stories that

205
00:28:54,715 --> 00:29:00,415
make much the disposal tiny country and just denmark. Denmark, looks were weekly, and they were publishing.

206
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:04,820
I think in a month, they were publishing more than Al the stuff was sold here. Right. Amazing.

207
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:25,926
Which is why you still find yourself going to Denmark. Right? Yeah because it talked just to they're still compared to her. Right. Yeah. That's awesome. Thanks for relating that. I appreciate it Yeah. I'm I'm really interested in the, like, behind the scenes of how it came out. It's amazing to me I it blows my mind that Disney comics

208
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:32,427
who, you know, was like, they didn't only publish Barks stuff. You know, they were clearly interested

209
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:40,064
other publishers, or is it it it blows my mind that they could like let you get lost in the shuffle as like

210
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:43,430
section matter what we did, we couldn't get a rejection.

211
00:29:44,366 --> 00:30:01,488
We we sent like, really nice letters, you know, cover letters with the story ideas and stories and try different things we tried shorts after wrong stuff. Tried the same stuff we sent to ads and john clerk took ten minutes. You wants to start. A year. You're trying to sell through doesn't. At incredible sense was really strange.

212
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:04,979
Alright. So

213
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:08,568
we're gonna we're gonna get into then secret

214
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:37,110
which is a fun title. It's it's nice and intrigued. And it was un I guess, when It was originally published, but we were talking a little bit about this originally, this is a a pretty rare case of where Barks seems to have referred to a previous story in this case he referred to the story that we just talked about. We have a pretty spa opening that we're not outside this time. The Ducktales just inside the house in front of the calendar

215
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:38,630
You guys

216
00:30:39,265 --> 00:30:40,005
The calendar

217
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:46,845
itself is such a funny little background site gag that I'm just picking up on. It's really.

218
00:30:47,919 --> 00:31:11,679
The rapid facing the hunter. It seems to have a rabbit chasing a hunter who's just dropped his gun. Right. But but Donald is mentioning that it's January again, time to make our resolutions and the nephews are referencing the last story that he made a resolution last year and broke it within a week and and both sets of docs are talking about have the each of them

219
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:13,279
knew the others

220
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:16,254
resolution So clearly, that was the problem

221
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:30,642
because it they made it hard for each other. And Donald has a solution to this, warren you wanna tell us what the solution is? While the solution is that this year, we won't tell each other what we've resolved. And then, of course, the nephews is immediately

222
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:32,693
don't find any fund in that.

223
00:31:33,312 --> 00:31:39,619
And then they sort of challenge donald by saying, you know, how will we know whether or not we're keeping our valve or in, and.

224
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,699
Yeah. Good question.

225
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:55,269
Yeah. Exactly. I will we know And it it gets donald to kind of scratch head and say, I... Yeah. We can haven't figured that one out. Yet. It's still a deep sink. No. Not at all. No. No. I like I like the Barks is kinda

226
00:31:55,688 --> 00:32:05,254
he's obviously taking the time to think about the ins and outs of how this would actually play out. Yeah. This is a rare story and then it almost entirely takes place in

227
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:09,262
yeah. I was that too. I noticed that. Yeah. Barks

228
00:32:09,422 --> 00:32:22,459
is really setting self up for with a problem because it's hard to carry something with one setting. Just like a movie the same way if you just put in your house. There's just like two panels with the nephews outside walking. And one was donald looking into the house, but the rest of its fall in the house.

229
00:32:23,911 --> 00:32:33,209
Yeah. I'm really glad you mentioned that because it's gonna be interesting to kind of think about the ways that Barks is gonna keep this one interesting, the little sign,

230
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:36,809
the ways that he's gonna kind of change

231
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,264
the perspective

232
00:32:38,564 --> 00:32:39,784
to break the pace

233
00:32:40,164 --> 00:32:53,402
up a little bit. It it's it's really interesting. The because of toys farming toys, which is kinda cool too. Ones got track one's got cow one's gonna pick on Scrooge. Because that was kinda fun. It's a great thing though pointed out. Gentlemen because

234
00:32:54,060 --> 00:33:04,135
I I'm just kinda looking ahead and we're gonna see them change from room to room. Yeah. We're gonna we're gonna see a lot of different examples of of Carl Barks

235
00:33:05,054 --> 00:33:06,912
funny background Barks

236
00:33:07,091 --> 00:33:08,724
or his overly full

237
00:33:09,342 --> 00:33:15,386
goldfish fish bowls. Yes. And donald the those very much into black black velvet with painting apparently.

238
00:33:17,318 --> 00:33:18,709
I was wondering but

239
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,467
Right. So

240
00:33:20,886 --> 00:33:33,099
so Donald does figure out a good solution to this. And and again, it it it's a great setup for a story. He says we'll write our resolutions on pieces of paper and seal them in an

241
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:37,326
envelope. And then in a week, they can open and kinda have a big reveal.

242
00:33:38,022 --> 00:33:46,439
And this you guys this is very intriguing to me As a reader, I can see immediately how this works. This is a great setup. So

243
00:33:46,778 --> 00:33:49,755
we get a little panel or a little sequence

244
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:52,207
We get a couple of very

245
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:54,644
funny. I imagine that they're simultaneous

246
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:56,083
sequences

247
00:33:56,781 --> 00:34:03,956
where we're gonna get the the master stroke of this story. The two docks are going to independently

248
00:34:04,452 --> 00:34:09,197
come up with new year's revolutions that that are entirely in conflict

249
00:34:09,656 --> 00:34:41,199
with each other. Yeah. What well what else would you expect? Yeah. The one thing that I love about this story, the thing that puts it over for me, first of all, Donald what he's thinking about, like, what he's gonna do, I love those panels have in thinking. Those two panels on this page were he says his him his his hand resting on his chin if he had a chance. He he's like, you know, how their longer heads about food and how he's gonna know down that it was to do something good for the family. And the kids are doing that too. And it reminded me, I read this first when I was in high school. I know it was at that time because I just because I immediately

250
00:34:41,697 --> 00:35:05,712
recognize probably ricardo source. First of them, you know than doing good trying to do good for each other. They end up doing bad for themselves. Both of them, and it's just like the o story, the Christmas story where the man going to buy his wife comes for a long hair and I both really broke the poorly young couple. Have no money. So he sells his watch to buy the tongue for his wife's hair. His wife sells her hair to get a watch chain for the gun.

251
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:26,564
They're really young. But but it's not a bad thing. You know, Both it is a bad. Thing but when they get together. You know, they realized how much they loved each other and like got emotional kind... You know, like, they both gave sold their was surprised thing to for the other one. And this is the same thing but kind of in reverse. You know, it's like... It's like a humorous, like a but it's the same idea. You know?

252
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:28,084
You know,

253
00:35:28,964 --> 00:35:48,386
instead of... They're both trying to do a good thing, the food business. The back. Just like black first with the Christmas henry. So I bet, he had he with red that, he love the story and wanted to include that tricky business. That's great. You know, and I I'd love the the... I love the way that they wanted to do good for each other. I I just picked out that. I wasn't aware

254
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:49,205
the.

255
00:35:49,819 --> 00:36:18,926
Very. There. But I I really I really do like the noble gestures that both want to do, the thing that makes it feels good. You know, it feels good. Yeah. I like that Take Patrick. I think I think you're probably right because I myself have not read the o henry story. But I'm familiar with it. It's like one of those things that's embedded in the pop culture. Yes. Nineteen o five. It was really one Right. I I think I can remember some like Simpson references where they make jokes about it.

256
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,949
That's that's sort of a thing that comes up a lot. So.

257
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:30,310
Yeah. I think that's probably influenced a lot of people a sweet story. This is a very sweet story. That's all the desserts going.

258
00:36:30,844 --> 00:36:50,904
Right. Hey. So, Patrick, why don't you tell us what specifically what does Donald resolve and then warren I'll have you tell the other? Yeah. Donald resolves that the kids love desserts. He's always forcing other stuff on him. So he's going to go along and give them nothing go what they want food wise. And he's gonna partake too. It's just gonna be desserts constantly. Right?

259
00:36:51,664 --> 00:37:08,069
Basic, simple thing. It's gonna try and make happy with providing them the food they will. And and warren, what what do the kids resolve? So as it nephews are talking and they resolved to bring peace to the Ducktales family, which I really like that. But their solution was to

260
00:37:08,488 --> 00:37:17,939
resolve eat only the kind of food that I donald as always wanted them to eat, and that's potatoes, corn breaded and turn of greens. Healthy food. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

261
00:37:19,914 --> 00:37:23,527
Right. So total conflict with two resolutions.

262
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:28,358
And and you know, we we should acknowledge, of course that, like, these are not realistic

263
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:32,005
and donald certainly should know better than

264
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,077
than making this. It's actually...

265
00:37:35,894 --> 00:37:40,801
I mean, technically, it's it's it's abusive to only feed the kids

266
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:41,840
sweet.

267
00:37:42,658 --> 00:37:51,409
But but it definitely works in the, like, comic book world for the cartoon lo. And the fact that there's secrets which makes sense of hilarious

268
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:52,489
right know.

269
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:55,784
Right. So we've got this awesome

270
00:37:56,204 --> 00:37:58,064
dynamic that is set up.

271
00:37:58,564 --> 00:38:04,104
Both both of them are determined to keep their resolutions We transition to where they

272
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,477
they put them in the envelope. And

273
00:38:07,176 --> 00:38:12,030
then as Donald hides it behind the clock, one of the nephews he asked, what happens.

274
00:38:12,503 --> 00:38:14,856
And they bring up a four fit again.

275
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:16,073
And,

276
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:21,216
you know, if they're gonna... Barks is gonna go with that old standby washing dishes

277
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:28,013
for a month. And the nephew... An nephew even calls it out, you always think of that same forfeit fit, but that's fine.

278
00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:34,819
So, we're gonna transition to the very immediately we transition to the first

279
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:38,469
instance where the resolutions are gonna be put to the test

280
00:38:39,048 --> 00:38:42,023
Warren, do you wanna tell us about this sequence? Well, sure.

281
00:38:42,441 --> 00:38:59,256
Donald launching right into it now. And he he knows what he wants to give the voice. We they'll make them happy he thinks However, the boys have this sort of... The the the thought bubble is this menu of of of healthy foods. And I think it's the resolution that they route. They're they're.

282
00:38:59,994 --> 00:39:07,222
That's right. We resolved the heat carrots. That's right. That's what it is. I I can read it now. Care turn up and greens. And so they say,

283
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:12,655
a carrot salad boiled beats, we suppose mcdonald. Yes. That'll be just dandy.

284
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:31,628
Look at that as great expression they're they're innocent, you know, is what makes this funny. It's like it does only and the kids. They're in the about. Are trying to do something good. And it's gonna turn out disastrous and the Hub and the whole story revolves around all these thing con collections the Barks comes up with the the types of desserts and things the name.

285
00:39:31,965 --> 00:39:56,864
I know this is the story, but what troubled me is if if Donald had asked them the day before, they would have said Gui treats and donuts and thighs. And they... It just it was a wonderful twist on the writing and the the story gateway way it's moving. I I really like you guys for for whatever reason, just the artwork of donald baking is really really nice in this. Yeah. So I I think that the order is the story is particularly

286
00:39:57,204 --> 00:39:57,704
decorative

287
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:21,686
strong. It's like because it doesn't have Al outside thing to show other things and trying and hard to decorate the duct house and make it interesting. And I think that's one of the things I like about is the composition of the panels and things that was... You're not they're not fancy. It there's nothing really exciting going on. But he's trying really hard with the and things. Placement blocks. And I'll know that all of Donald baked goods they look very enticing. They do.

288
00:40:22,326 --> 00:40:37,249
Tasty. So Patrick, do wanna tell us what he brings out? Well, he brings out on the trade holding with his hand probably like he's waiter. I here you are boys choco claire butter scotch putting banana cream Pine, and instead of being happy now. They can't do the go for of or

289
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:41,489
ever do to deserve this, since I right in front of them

290
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:43,629
because of their resolution. Right.

291
00:40:44,963 --> 00:40:51,927
And and so here's where the resolutions do come into to play as you say, and the Nephews is like nervous

292
00:40:52,385 --> 00:40:54,218
asked for just potatoes

293
00:40:55,236 --> 00:41:04,851
instead. And and Donald annoyed because, like baking is hard work. Right? And and we get to see as he leaves to make something else

294
00:41:05,387 --> 00:41:11,462
the Nephews are like I find the art of them just straining themselves very funny.

295
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:14,474
One of the nephews like holding himself

296
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:16,787
very mother mother like

297
00:41:18,361 --> 00:41:27,914
where he's reacting to them about the potatoes. He's like, Al the nerve. Like, he's, like, mother donald and gets a feeling is like he's like this him now. Know. He's like right

298
00:41:28,254 --> 00:41:45,319
consulting is wonderful banking skills. Yeah. Because Donald is he's he's a caregiver too as much as we're used to seeing him like as Angry Donald. He is also their caregiver, and so he's gotta do a lot of domestic stuff. I like what he brings out. He brings out hate

299
00:41:45,778 --> 00:41:49,963
potatoes baked with special caramel custard filling,

300
00:41:50,401 --> 00:41:52,177
and drenched with Marshmallow

301
00:41:53,072 --> 00:41:59,344
Say. Yeah. That was that reference back to the last story remember I said there was a there was something in here it was similar

302
00:41:59,724 --> 00:42:02,199
a kid might not guess. You know. Yeah I

303
00:42:03,419 --> 00:42:05,119
say is he is he

304
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:07,199
the word moose is

305
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:27,434
Okay Yeah. Yeah. And so... But the way he says it is just funny and and and I can imagine in the kitchen while the boys are friday. He's saying, how can I not break my solution by giving them a potato stuff with all these sweet gooey things? I think that's just brilliant. Yeah. Right. And and so it's gonna go on this way for the next page,

306
00:42:27,772 --> 00:42:36,336
you know, and and the key thing for poor donald is that part of his resolution says that he's gonna eat this stuff too. So he.

307
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:48,062
He has to choke it down. What do you guys think of the panels he does that. I think they're very funny. Yeah. It's there some of the funny or stuff in the story. Yeah. His facial expressions the shape of his head changing

308
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,813
his body shaking his throat. I mean, everything is throat.

309
00:42:52,910 --> 00:43:03,365
And and Barks really zoom in. Right? Totally those Yeah. That eating sequence. It's it's all very funny. And and the poor nephews are just

310
00:43:03,824 --> 00:43:10,270
subs on raw turn on lettuce leaves or broccoli stems, chopped with beeps tops.

311
00:43:11,526 --> 00:43:13,080
Yeah. So So

312
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,760
everyone in the story is really suffering

313
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:22,915
right now. And on the next page, he just made it through one day. I mean, they're just they're just now going to bed. Yeah. Right.

314
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:24,035
Exactly.

315
00:43:24,755 --> 00:43:48,925
Do you wanna tell us warren about the the exchanges at night that first night? Well, they they can't go on like this. They they realize that eating raw vegetables while go down loads up on the Gluten treats were starving in the mid of plenty. I love that line. So for breakfast snuggle donald, served pepper, you know, peppermint on cake and lunch fudge pie. So this is all happening over the days, you know, of the the next day.

316
00:43:49,343 --> 00:43:51,440
And for dinner, I they going

317
00:43:51,858 --> 00:43:53,875
that are that are happening. One of

318
00:43:54,412 --> 00:43:56,064
about calls work yeah.

319
00:43:57,021 --> 00:45:00,492
They some stand out for me. It's a chronic book a genius comic Al opposed to a writing work with withdrawing. Is the way because store is a good example the way he integrates visual gag like food the like in the last page eating, but even food up with the written stuff without it is the same thing with the you oh put them together like what you just what you just said. It's like, you know, you like... It's a perfectly integrated and it's better than if the underwriting or the visual separate... If you put it together the writing and Inducks of the food and I'm talking about it add up to something. It's like, much Right? Yeah. Because they're happening in separate panels and it it enrich the entire story. And they continue to plot not plot, but they continue, you know, Barks embed they and and they start thinking, well, they we can't steam open that we'll envelope and tear up our resolution. So now they're they're getting the reader to start thinking about how do they back out of this thing. Right. And you know what? Patrick you said there is like, a really neat observation, I think? Because I I was thinking this too that it wouldn't have been as interesting if he had shown

320
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:01,890
another sequence.

321
00:45:02,404 --> 00:45:08,987
Right with with another set of food. By by having the nephews just talking about it,

322
00:45:09,426 --> 00:45:47,335
it it adds to it and and the reader almost feels like they've seen another day worth of these things or or these other meals. It it's it reminded me of of the golden fleece when the la keys are serving up their horrible dishes. We act only see two of the keys. Right Like serve, they're disgusting and very funny dishes, and then we see two other Barks keys just talking about their dishes to each other, so it's... It would have been repetitive. If he had done the same thing with all of them. Yeah. Carl

323
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:55,711
reinforces rather than the piece. The reinforces is like a visual thing with words after, like, talking about it It makes it seem more real right real thing.

324
00:45:56,404 --> 00:46:14,137
That's the Barks of like, someone is a really great comic artist as opposed to somebody just like the heck who's doing things for money. And right that, we'll just do it just go it out. And and you he like heck a person who doesn't know go this not thinking about it. We'll just show the thing and talk about it. And redundant where somebody that carl

325
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:17,763
the stuff in way that really makes for a final

326
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,263
artistic product. Right. And it makes it much more readable.

327
00:46:22,742 --> 00:46:35,645
Yeah. You guys... I don't know about you, but I I definitely feel a little more sympathetic to Donald. In this one, then in the this is the point right here where the kids are talking about. No. That would be cheating This is where the point was donald falls.

328
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:44,030
Right here... Like in your other story it happens early on this start And this one, Donald holds out and here, right when the store is when he cracks.

329
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:44,884
Yeah.

330
00:46:45,724 --> 00:46:46,344
Which is.

331
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:58,229
Not good. And I feel I feel a bit for him. Right? I I understand a little more why he cracks here know he's see by this. Yeah. Like he he looks miserable.

332
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:03,570
We see we see baking soda on his night stand. It's pretty funny.

333
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:19,182
You caught that. I didn't see that yeah. The making soda in the water about... Yeah. He was talking about this Pepsi which actually know what it is. Day the baking so it goes along with bit. Yeah. Yeah. Barb uses that term a couple of times. I think it's just an archaic term for suggestion.

334
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:36,121
As far as I know, but but anyway, he... He does exactly what the nephews were were debating doing. Right? It's a nice touch. They they consider it but resolve not to. He just goes for it. He he steam it open so that he can write a new resolution

335
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:46,879
and and I... That might have been okay if he had just done that, but he goes the extra step he buys on the kids resolution

336
00:47:47,538 --> 00:47:49,794
and sees that they have been

337
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:50,992
resisting

338
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,986
his goodies for that very reason

339
00:47:54,843 --> 00:48:06,085
And he says, I shouldn't few things to himself, it shouldn't be such a heel, but I'm gonna see just how long those little pie is can move up to that if it's Noble valve.

340
00:48:06,739 --> 00:48:12,439
Donald donald is going back to who donald is. Yeah. Yeah I like how the kids talk about the plane

341
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:14,819
some food and their little. Yeah. Yeah.

342
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:17,294
Al letter. Yeah Right.

343
00:48:17,632 --> 00:48:22,488
So the the story picks up pretty quickly here are you guys. I like that we just...

344
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:25,019
I like that we just see a quick little

345
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:28,232
couple of panels for the next couple of meals.

346
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:33,300
Donald says you who voice breakfast, Patrick, you wanna tell us what breakfast is?

347
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:36,234
Chocolate creams and with honey Barks

348
00:48:37,035 --> 00:48:49,149
and then we store it. Yeah dent not bars with maple sugar peanut pie and for lunch we got good goodnight. They're just... They're just cracking at this point. They're really, like, just losing it. Right. And,

349
00:48:49,529 --> 00:48:50,989
you know, the the kids

350
00:48:51,544 --> 00:48:55,904
Barks narrator box comments that the kids are going to pieces.

351
00:48:56,304 --> 00:49:03,329
Do you wanna tell us warren about what they're up to? Well, as they sit on the this wonderful fifty style couch. I love that. Again that's

352
00:49:03,825 --> 00:49:18,978
house that the long lean architect the furniture design. As a is they are gru and and making them their... Your... They see one of the... I think it is sit down dewey we. Yeah. Dewey is saying well, I'm just trying to forget my stomach by playing detective.

353
00:49:19,477 --> 00:49:34,449
He's he's sort of distracting himself with this this desire to pick up this detective mega find glass and little kit that he's got. I love that little kit the little little bag. Do you guys ever play detectives as kids? Oh, sure. Sure. Absolutely

354
00:49:34,788 --> 00:49:35,728
and detective

355
00:49:36,187 --> 00:49:38,045
secret codes and invisible.

356
00:49:38,464 --> 00:50:06,092
It was a lot of fun, especially I think in this era. I grew up in the age of get smart and that was the funny... The funny detective, you know, the Don adams character and and... But then of course, just the know the show holmes in me. My... I'm sure like holmes fan attic and I just love solving the mysteries I can I could see this really being attractive to the boys? Yeah. So this is another sequence where Barks is gonna echo himself a little bit He has one of the kids

357
00:50:06,987 --> 00:50:09,337
set apart. Just a little. And then

358
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:11,372
there's a little bit of a documentary

359
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,166
moment where he's gonna take some pictures.

360
00:50:14,704 --> 00:50:15,204
Dewey

361
00:50:15,901 --> 00:50:26,336
claims that he wants to try out his camera that Grandma gave him for Christmas, so he has Donald pose, and then he has Donald pose in his cap and coats.

362
00:50:28,374 --> 00:50:41,589
And, again, we can't see it coming. Know, yeah, detected business. Capital right the around in that one panel we don't really know what to kick found out, how we could've have found out So they took a again, he's like setting up their ending surprise and counseling just like us.

363
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:49,505
Right. Even though the stories are both resolution stories, they really feel a lot different as far as, like, that ending coming even though it's etcetera

364
00:50:50,045 --> 00:50:54,125
it's like just like in the last story. That's right. You probably did that purpose.

365
00:50:54,845 --> 00:51:17,656
Yeah I think so. Don't feel like it's I don't feel like it's redundant from the two stories. The two stores are very different. Mh. I agree. And and you're right, he doesn't call too much attention to the detective stuff. It's it's not something. Generally, it Barks the stories is I think. That surprise thing is set up earlier a story. Both of these stories is quite late story mystery to. How

366
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:23,842
little twice like that. Yeah. I think you're probably right. I like the next sequence a lot. The afternoon

367
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,414
snack sequence.

368
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:29,169
Wanna tell us warren what Donald sets out for the Nephews?

369
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:31,645
All my favorite candid c

370
00:51:33,036 --> 00:51:40,974
you're on the table help yourself boys. I'll do some work outside. So gives him a chance to to go out outdoors, but and then can become across, sir. Certainly...

371
00:51:42,272 --> 00:51:49,859
That's great how this great how the played Across is bigger than the boys. Oh, yeah. That's right. It it's local almost

372
00:51:50,598 --> 00:52:01,555
yeah that perspective. But they're really uploads in the in the camera. Yeah. It's it's very funny that Can come quite are are the Nephew favorite treat in this one,

373
00:52:02,272 --> 00:52:14,263
It's a pretty obscure fruit. I imagine it was... I... I'm gonna assume it was still obscure back in the fifties. Yeah. I think the Al he would pick weird things like, the big boys and the pre. You know. Right.

374
00:52:15,182 --> 00:52:21,508
I I just think the word come quite. Is is puts a smile on your face. I mean, it is that's funny word.

375
00:52:22,028 --> 00:52:22,528
And

376
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:26,380
Al the candy them after all, no wonder the boys love them.

377
00:52:26,759 --> 00:52:27,499
You're absolutely

378
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:40,192
right Warren. It's it's just an inherently funny word. I saw some comedian talking about words that were funny in the rules. And think words, I think you mentioned that words with a lot of are just currently more funny. Yep.

379
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:42,299
So

380
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:44,535
The Nephews, you know, Donald

381
00:52:45,631 --> 00:52:55,482
makes an excuse to go outside and then nephew and watch the Nephews spy on them. And they give into to temptation, and he rushed in and excited announces

382
00:52:55,859 --> 00:52:59,407
that he's caught them breaking the resolution and and the nephews

383
00:52:59,945 --> 00:53:04,676
right lead question. How did you know our resolution and if Donald.

384
00:53:05,174 --> 00:53:07,431
Go ahead, Patrick. It's like completely

385
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:14,266
logical that he says I guess it this like you... But the kids are young enough, I guess the they just fall for it. Yeah. Right. Right.

386
00:53:14,883 --> 00:53:22,585
Right. He can pretend that he's guest it. I mean, reasonably, either of them should been able to guess the others resolution

387
00:53:22,964 --> 00:53:26,520
by their their weird behavior the last couple of days. Whatever.

388
00:53:27,015 --> 00:53:35,786
So as he goes to open the envelope, two of the the two of the nephews are upset because they've been caught, quote sticky handed.

389
00:53:37,098 --> 00:53:37,598
And

390
00:53:37,975 --> 00:53:56,606
and he confirms opening that the resolution does say that that you not eat gooey goodies and and now we get the little moment though. Or the other nephew, Patrick you wanna tell us what the other nephew you points out, do we other the other nephew very stu pointing donald how about showing us your

391
00:53:57,064 --> 00:54:19,921
perhaps you not perfect yourself. This can what knows? No something. Half do we double half. My resolution says simply, I resolved to never again, wear my cap in the house, and of course he's got it wrong. It's it's a fun moment for the reader. Right? Because the reader processes is in that exact moment that, you know, has changed resolution. Never wear your cap in the house, he's got it on

392
00:54:20,635 --> 00:54:27,855
and it gives the nephews use a little moment to accuse and it's cute. Yeah. And I think it's a very cinematic sort of short page

393
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:51,495
Yeah. Lot moving kind of angle on kinda sean's going on because it's old in the house. He's trying make get interest like like on the last page when they're faced with the big giant play come across, and then the next panel was done and was looking through the window. It's a very easy thing to do. I agree. It's it's very... It's paced almost like the end. It's It's much lower steaks, but it's almost paced like a an ag the Christie

394
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:53,533
murder mystery review

395
00:54:54,192 --> 00:55:14,668
know New year's murder this. Right. Yeah And within the artwork, we see this wonderful I'm at on that previous page again when when Dewey is starting to sprinkle the powder on the table. He makes it a point, Carl makes it point to talk about the table and Al Donald walking off pretty much convinced he's one. Look what Doing... I mean, this is that little...

396
00:55:15,425 --> 00:55:31,671
I have to look at it twice. I'll be honest with you to say he's got the magnifying glass on the paper pad. And that where that's where I it. Oh my... That's brilliant. That is like Al little bit of that what's happening in the background of a hitch hitchcock film was happening in the background bag is a christie.

397
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:36,085
Yeah. And when when he's pointing it mcdonald's with the cameras right behind him. Alright.

398
00:55:36,765 --> 00:55:40,025
Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. This one really benefits.

399
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:40,920
From

400
00:55:41,700 --> 00:56:00,020
reread. And and so it goes... It's warren. The reason that you're talking about the detective kit. Right, is is because that... Well well, first off, the docs resolve. They kinda clear up that, okay. Yeah. Maybe we both broke the resolution, but Donald points out that they broke. First,

401
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:14,475
and and that's the moment that Dewey has him dead to write. Yeah. Because he says if who broke who, if who broke who's resolution First is all that matters, you're the loser on donald and

402
00:56:14,855 --> 00:56:34,015
he explains that he has a picture of him in that camera from two hours ago wearing. It does feel very hitch hitchcock. That really does. I love this so much. This is just one of most brilliant twisty endings. I thought the first story had that in that's in the ski, and and that was funny. This is remarkable.

403
00:56:34,509 --> 00:56:36,247
The way that tricky

404
00:56:36,585 --> 00:56:41,037
and. And the nephews they kinda of wrap it up where dewey explains

405
00:56:41,535 --> 00:56:50,516
that it was not luck or an accident that he snapped that picture but that he had figured out from playing with his detective kit That's

406
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:55,557
you know, he was able to to let the little grains of dust

407
00:56:56,213 --> 00:57:00,582
rest in the pencil grooves in the paper and he was able to read

408
00:57:01,135 --> 00:57:14,444
that Donald had written. I resolved never again wear my cap in the house. And we got a fun little cap of Donald washing the dishes. I love the contrast between the c and the box. It's just a wonderful that they almost look identical,

409
00:57:15,103 --> 00:57:17,581
but very simple, great closure. Right.

410
00:57:18,475 --> 00:57:56,658
In a in a story that relies on props a lot with the camera and pan, the the business that business with the attach is really beautiful Mh. Is the last page. That accounts that you commented on earlier. States through the stories. Like completely feature there in the last page the design and the accounts Yeah, The rich pattern, but it is a nice stylish one. And as you say, it's kind of the home base that they keep coming back to. Yeah. So it sounds like we we enjoyed this one a lot. Patrick, I know you were excited to talk about this. What what what your overall feelings on this one? I think it's... I think it's a solid solid story around. It's nice balanced. It's got good draw Barks good the background

411
00:57:57,276 --> 00:58:25,320
things are important in the way need to carry the story through need to make an interesting and crowded. You accept this story up to be, you know, Al pretty much all of the it's a difficult thing to pull off and I think Al it's got little bit of detective kind of stuff going on. But mostly it's got that Oh henry kind of born I'm trying to do something for the other person thing that that virus on both Right. I think that that was the thing that I remember from the story that really like talking to you guys I've seen some

412
00:58:25,976 --> 00:58:31,700
between. So yeah, I think some are around. It's not it's not a plus story, but it's a very solo

413
00:58:32,277 --> 00:58:32,777
will

414
00:58:33,649 --> 00:59:07,586
So which one do you think is is the better? You you prefer this one. Right? Yeah. I prefer this over the first... The first one is a little bit to lose some Chaos for me and the in the story itself. And then like, the gag are really outlandish and they tend to be... It tends to be... I think that for Karl, Carl was more like into this story when he do it, what the thing was the other one. Just my opinion. And you argue either way because of the store very close as words Al like, get the same general subject matter and Other has a lot more outside stuff and what we're actually going on, but this one for me better... And I... I I think you nailed it.

415
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:24,876
What what about you, Are? What what are your thoughts? Well, I I love both stories, and that's not my final answer, but my... But I do like the way he'd linked them. And I like the way in the contrast Patrick, I didn't even think about the interior shots versus the first story. I enjoyed the first story a lot.

416
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:31,351
But when contrasting it to this story, this is a more mature story. This is a far more

417
00:59:31,851 --> 00:59:37,111
cinematic story we use that term earlier. The other one is more like a Tv come. Maybe a small cartoon.

418
00:59:37,528 --> 00:59:43,663
If you're gonna put them into which media you would use, I would I would say The second story is absolutely

419
00:59:44,398 --> 01:00:26,191
well so well written and conceived and what I love about both stories is that Carl Barks made the decision to have one nephew kinda split off and and and bring in the twist. And that that was really consistent I don't know if he intentionally did that. It's hard to say he did he intentionally. He had kept done intentional It's not something he did off way. It didn't usually pull that pull the climax x store having an enough do something like that. So I think that virus... Go ahead. Be Yeah. Probably does that in the first story. Right. Liked how it works. Exactly When visit it, and they picked this story with the same general thing to we revisit it. This is what I think. I I I can't see carla

420
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:27,029
realizing.

421
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:37,945
I I agree. And and I think that what what what he loved about the first story was peeling Louie off and now we're gonna peel dewey off, but we're also going to I'm gonna think about how to

422
01:00:38,284 --> 01:00:39,863
surprise the reader even more

423
01:00:40,202 --> 01:01:12,102
and draw in the visual clues even better because we didn't see Louie with a camera in the background. We didn't know he was there. But this one, all the clues are there and very much like I could cocky and story. It all takes place in one one setting. And that's hard to pull off and he did it. It is. Oh sorry. Move I'm gonna give to the second story, a little bit of a bump over the first one. Yep. Excellent. Well said, you guys I love this one. Like, I I read this. It's... This was published in nine team. My reprint was in nineteen ninety.

424
01:01:12,519 --> 01:01:23,856
Two probably fifty six. Yeah. And and I read this when I was twelve. And, like, this was a great age to read this one. And I I went back to this one a lot.

425
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:32,587
I did not re reread the first one very much at all to the point that I honestly, I barely remembered it. I think it's a fun

426
01:01:33,124 --> 01:01:37,976
even a pretty good Barks story. But I find this one just unusually...

427
01:01:38,376 --> 01:01:57,237
As you say, Patrick, it's not like an a plus story It's not like gold standard, but it's very solid and it... Is a that's it's it's. Yeah. It's an upper tier story. It's in incredibly entertaining. It's so fun to see it play out, and it's it's just got all these fun little touches, these fun little elements,

428
01:01:57,856 --> 01:02:00,090
greatest fresh great backgrounds.

429
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:06,431
I I think this is a delightful story. Yep. So you guys let's let's check it on the community.

430
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:08,141
Before we wrap it up,

431
01:02:08,677 --> 01:02:15,886
because these are actually both pretty well regarded by the community, if you check on Inducks, the site where people can

432
01:02:16,303 --> 01:02:17,538
rate the stories.

433
01:02:18,176 --> 01:02:20,270
The earlier one revolution

434
01:02:20,607 --> 01:02:46,005
gets a seven point three, which is good for rank four seventy eight as of right now And that actually puts it in somewhere in the top twenty five percent of Barks ten pages if you compare them, like against each other. So seven point three four seventy eight. Secret resolutions is a seven point five and it gets ranked top two hundred and forty one.

435
01:02:46,819 --> 01:02:51,988
And so this is actually... It it peaks into the top ten percent of

436
01:02:52,326 --> 01:02:54,840
fan favorite Barks ten pager.

437
01:02:55,255 --> 01:02:58,709
And and I think that's right. It's not like in the Al time

438
01:02:59,366 --> 01:03:10,030
conversation, but this is a notably good story and kind of unusual that the follow is is better. You know, than the first one. So really fun stories. They're both very

439
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:12,070
worthwhile and and

440
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:21,476
and they make a great New Year's read. Yeah. True. Yeah. You guys thank you so much. I think I feel like we did a pretty good job of covering

441
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:29,713
our favorite panels unless there's one that, you know, we didn't get to talk about that you really wanted to highlight. I'll just say and I think Donald

442
01:03:30,091 --> 01:03:44,040
it stream anger at the end of the first story was really a highlight for me to see him it with the artwork. And then the second story focusing on donald again at the table while he trying to swallow all these foods. I think that to me, the the artwork

443
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,400
and then Carl is focus on Donald, the character

444
01:03:47,834 --> 01:04:12,289
to see what he could do to exaggerate that body that face what was really put in the test of these stories. Right. And how about you patrick any panels have trouble like taking this from Barks and finding one one panel that's, like, a lot better the others are like. You know, I tend to like the panel to panel stuff and the individual panel. So we choose a specific one like, it can't design. Right. Like I like the general construction.

445
01:04:12,908 --> 01:04:17,540
Excellent. Well, gentlemen, thank you so much for joining me for this New Year's

446
