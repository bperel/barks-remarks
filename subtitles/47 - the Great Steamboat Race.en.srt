1
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,495
We can have

00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:37,825

publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome come back to Barks remarks, I'm Mark Sever, a grown man who enjoys dot comics, and I am joined by a returning guest host. I've got warren harm here. Warren could you

4
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:10,694
reintroduce yourself and let us know if you've ever had the pleasure of being on a river boat. Well, thanks, Mark. Great to be back

5
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:26,285
with this story. This is a is a kind a childhood memory that I cherish in for a few reasons, I live in the state where the Mississippi River comes from. So that that that means a lot. And up here in Minnesota. But but long time Barks collector

6
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:37,710
and comic fan, really everything Barks. And, yeah, that's the steamboat River boat connection here. There's a wonderful little River town called Red Wing, Minnesota where they have a tourist

7
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:38,748
boat

8
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:39,664
that

9
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:50,045
you can jump on in the summer and and la go down the Mississippi, and it's really a lot of fun to do that. So it it it's around a lake that actually is embedded in the river called Lake pep,

10
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:55,488
and it's just a wonderful experience But I thing, the most memorable

11
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:57,605
and I believe it is still a steamboat,

12
00:01:58,344 --> 00:02:03,570
listeners will correct me, but I think the Mark twain at Disney disneyland, is is something that I

13
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:15,915
have been on many times because every time I go to the park out Anaheim, I love a ride around in the Barks on the market. Yeah. That's that's true. I never really thought about it, but I guess I guess, technically, it is it is a genuine

14
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:23,442
a bonafide river steamboat belt. Is this yeah? Yeah. So I've gotten to... I've gotten to be on a

15
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:29,730
a river boat on the Mississippi. My cousin had a Mississippi had a New Orleans wedding

16
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:31,848
and part of the festivities

17
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:32,967
included

18
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:56,835
a reception on a river boat closing down the Mississippi, which was just just big spectacular great experience. Yeah it's a romantic adventure. No no question and and imagine back to the the nineteenth century payday when they were they were the a a a major form of transportation. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. And and steamboat boats and the Mississippi river, you know, they've figure,

19
00:02:57,215 --> 00:03:08,090
they figure in a really important way into the Barks and the Ducktales stories. Right? Because I shouldn't bear the lead here. We're we're gonna be talking today about the great

20
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,010
steamboat

21
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:09,670
race.

22
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,090
And and Barks really...

23
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,390
His imagination was really fired.

24
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:17,781
These these steamboat boats by these boats.

25
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,016
Well, there's no question that and I really believe he was

26
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:34,890
fired is is a great word. He he his is fired. So coal fired. Right right. And he he just... Just really re and looking back in history and Know, we'll do a little research.

27
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:51,772
We'll do a little bit of historical perspective here as well. But, yeah. This is kind of a Al almost a love story with the river. Kinda like Barks Wayne. You got Barks has the same kind of romantic notion about the river and the racing and the old salt. Right. Yeah. The Mississippi is an important piece of American.

28
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:57,245
And and one way or another, it just really figures in Scrooge

29
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,105
backstory.

30
00:03:58,565 --> 00:04:03,668
Yeah. Rx sparks has gone back to this a couple of times and and when Don Rosa,

31
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:17,136
picked up those stories, he added his own flare. It's it's a really great setting. For these stories. So let's see. The the great steamboat race was published Inducks

32
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:26,880
Scrooge number eleven, and that was back in the cover date was September of nineteen fifty five. Right? This is a pretty john

33
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:34,999
short little Barks of a story worn. Sixteen pages. What what do you think? I like it. I

34
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:40,599
as much as I love getting into a a a a twenty eight or a thirty two page story.

35
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:59,199
The sixteen pages seem to deliver a lot of action in a short amount of time and get right to the point with with one strong story that thread. And and, you know, you can really deviate too far from from the plot, and you have to stay with it. All the way to the end but. I I like it. It's a nice... It's a it's a pe

36
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:12,580
story length for me. Yeah. I mean, I like it two. Sometimes it's... I... It's nice to see what he can do at different lengths. You know, I I didn't check for sure, but I'm pretty sure that a part from

37
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,580
the fire bug

38
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:15,499
and

39
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:30,523
Adam Bomb, Donald Adam bomb, this is the shortest adventure length story we've done so far. Yeah And when I created the podcast, I I didn't start out doing the ten pager kind of pivoted to do... Give those their own little

40
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:49,563
sub brand. But I I had to think about which stories I wanted to cover. Right? And and, you know, this one was paired Inducks Scrooge number eleven, along with another sixteen pager. And we could talk about both of those, but you know, to me it's important that each of these episodes really

41
00:05:50,062 --> 00:06:05,109
gives these adventure stories there like full do. They're they're they're full focus. So that's that's how I wanna do it. You know, This one's gonna be a little bit more of a shorter yeah. Short. And it stands on its own really well. It is as an adventure story

42
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:10,364
with a competitive race with the callback to history with intriguing character

43
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:20,685
in in Horseshoe hog. I mean, it really does have a lot of fun stuff. Yeah. This is a memorable one. I'll I'll admit that this has never been, like one of my all time favorites.

44
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:26,913
I do find it very enjoyable, but, like I realized going back to it that I I hadn't

45
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:35,825
reread this one to the way that it it wasn't burned into my memory. But like some of them were I generally remembered all of the story beats.

46
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,376
Right? There there are the occasional

47
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:59,119
stories that I revisit, and I... I'm like, I'm surprised that I don't I don't remember certain parts of them, but And then there are those where I just like, I I might as well not re reread it Remember so well. And this one, you know, I I remembered it in general, I remembered general, like, architecture of the storage Didn't remember the specific needs.

48
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,539
So that it'll be fun to to revisit this one.

49
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:04,734
I didn't mention

50
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:12,334
the number of reprint. This one for whatever reason hasn't been reprinted Al often. And it only as nine

51
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:13,149
American

52
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:15,249
reprint total. And, you know,

53
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:19,469
we we always... We like to mention

54
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:21,029
titles

55
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:22,642
from around the world.

56
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:29,668
I took a quick peru of this one and generally seems like most publishers have gone with a pretty straightforward

57
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:34,739
translation and So I'll just mention one that I liked from Spain, which was

58
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:44,014
And me see c p. The rule in the Mississippi. I like that one. And then later on, again, in Spain, it was locked around I got the.

59
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:47,434
Gotcha I think is just the great steam race.

60
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:52,898
So that that's fun. Am I correct to assume that the steamboat is truly Al American

61
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:59,824
invention it is? Isn't it it Fulton? Yeah. I think that's right. I don't I don't have open in front of me or anything

62
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:31,273
I believe it is. And I believe that's the of the attracted meter this story was the origin on the Mississippi the history. I know, like I said earlier, I'm I'm in Minnesota where the this be river Barks and I've been on it many times and different parts of it. But also the history and the just Scrooge competitive nature comes out in this. This is this is the fun part. And you can't forget the boys, they they are in my opinion and the stars of the story they save the day as usual. Yeah. It's true. They're pretty important here. I think you're right. This one feels like more American.

63
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:37,289
Than most of the adventure stories that we've seen so far and, like, the uncle Scrooge run of Comics

64
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:52,429
we're we're finally out of the, like single digits we're we're pretty thoroughly into this run of uncle Scrooge con here. And and so, you know, I guess Barks is willing to play a little bit with his format here, which is why we get this

65
00:08:52,768 --> 00:09:02,260
sixteen pager. What do you say warren? You're ready to dive into it? Let's go well let's get on that the on that steamboat and go on that race. Yeah. Let's do. Let's get our tickets punched.

66
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:10,429
The great steamboat race. Opens up you know, it's striking me worrying that this is one of the handful

67
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:12,959
of early uncle Scrooge, Barks

68
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:33,253
stories that does not open with him in the Bin. He's not in the money bin. He's he's pushing this southern gentleman out of his office, but, yeah, your right at that it doesn't start that way. Yeah. You're right. So we've got Scrooge in his private office and he is giving the rush to a character that we're gonna learn is named Horseshoe

69
00:09:33,752 --> 00:09:34,252
Hog.

70
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:35,930
Bark Loves that.

71
00:09:36,682 --> 00:09:41,726
Yeah. And they're basically in the middle of this like, long doing argument,

72
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:51,409
right? Where the the the other docks donald and the Nephews are walking up and their they're kinda serving as the audience surrogate, and they listen to

73
00:09:52,124 --> 00:10:05,615
hog who's kind of ranting about a hassle between the two of them, him and screws that's been going on for eighty five years and it needs to be settled. And hog is very determined to keep pest

74
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:06,533
screwed

75
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:11,382
until he is willing to to do it. And he's really...

76
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:22,058
Yeah. I use the portrait of a dapper southern gentleman. Yes. Yes. He's got the Goatee, the mustache. He's dressed with the best and the tie and the hat.

77
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:23,813
But every

78
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:45,403
image of horseshoe hog and this first page is one of frustration and anger. And so you don't know where this character development is gonna... Is gonna go. But Scrooge is not letting him gap his way at all. Right. And and he uses this expression that I don't I don't think you really hear these days. He calls him a dog and the manager

79
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:51,049
because he says, he allude to this prize, which is a place called corn

80
00:10:51,469 --> 00:11:04,081
Gables. He says, you don't seem to want corn pony gables. Yet You won't let me have it. You're just a dog and the manager. Were you familiar with that? You know. I am? I was not familiar with that. I looked it up

81
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:05,117
and

82
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:19,644
essentially, it means that you don't wanna give someone something that you also own, but you really don't care about very much. And it's yeah Yeah, it seems like it's one of those old sayings that that was probably in in common par.

83
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:28,243
A few decades ago and is just falling out of favor, but that's pretty... That's a pretty useful expression and it's exactly what I thought it was from context. Mh.

84
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,411
So warren before we kinda did on to the next page

85
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:33,703
I like...

86
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,058
I'm really intrigued by the character

87
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:45,070
of horse too hot. I I find it really kind of refreshing that he is not a villain. No. He's Al.

88
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:48,780
He's someone who if when you look at Scrooge,

89
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:53,174
family history as we move back in time, his ancestors, horseshoe,

90
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:58,229
kinda grew up with fruit and sisters and it it it it really brings another

91
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:03,297
level of of interest to the whole Ducktales universe into the whole to the whole.

92
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:05,390
So he's not he's not.

93
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:16,351
Someone who wants to strike a deal with his his old nemesis, and maybe is too strong work. I mean their adverse serial, but like, there's they're they're in competition,

94
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:25,210
but but they're they're Severino like really... He... He's not villainous. He's not scheming. He kinda reminds me of some of the later

95
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:29,899
competitions that you'll see in some of the, like, nineteenth sixties

96
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,899
screwed stories, you know, some of those like ty

97
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:33,839
competitions.

98
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:58,609
That don't have later. But, yeah. But yeah. I find that refresh no I do too. But Scrooge isn't having any of it. He's happy making money and horseshoe hog is just... Yeah. Inducks is only interested in making money he says, Right. And and you can tell that hog is like, he... He's clearly written as being very rich, but he's not like, rich for the sake of being rich like mortgages. We're gonna see him willing to, like... Right.

99
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:02,542
Spend money to get things done. He... He's an interesting

100
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,309
contrast. It's kind of a shame that he doesn't really here

101
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:16,311
other than Inducks, some sequel stories like as his Suzanne ancestor. Mh. So, you know, getting further into the story, so Scrooge is is basically

102
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:19,002
relating to Donald and and Inducks

103
00:13:19,162 --> 00:13:30,882
doo Louis. What the whole story right? And he explains that he and hog were locked in this competition. They they had their their ancestors.

104
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:38,070
Their ancestors sounds like really old. They're their uncles have had a race that they never finished

105
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:49,720
to determine the ownership of this place corn pound gables, and he shows him a helpful picture of it, and it's a beautiful old southern mansion as Donald

106
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:53,455
characterize it. And so you wanna tell us what Scrooge

107
00:13:53,949 --> 00:14:04,464
sp about eighteen seventy? Well, yeah. They were they were the River captain Horseshoe uncle was Parker hog, and his boat was called the River bell and Scrooge

108
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:14,100
leaning back in his chair is just finally remembering that his uncle was captain Pothole Mc, and his boat was the Stern wheeler cotton queen, so

109
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:22,228
again, it took me back to eighteen Severino, so I did a little research, and sure enough The great steamboat race of eighteen seventy actually did exist.

110
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:23,005
Nice.

111
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:34,012
Between the Natchez and the Robert y lee, and it really did take place on the Mississippi in that year. So I have to believe that was Barks as inspiration for this week. Yeah. Absolutely.

112
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:35,767
Right? Because he he

113
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,561
identifies the racist

114
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:38,374
starting

115
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:43,802
in natchez, which I guess must be taken from that. That's it good to catch. I didn't.

116
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:46,476
And so that's just a little bit of his

117
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,290
perspective.

118
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:52,390
When you look at the year eighteen seventy or five years after the civil war America needed healing,

119
00:14:53,149 --> 00:15:01,499
everyone in America and the press picked up on this great race of eighteen seventy, and it just marble America. Now the steamboat

120
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:12,544
Al a mode of transportation was coming to the end. What was taking over the train, the locomotive. And that's what it was gonna, you know, connect the to two halves of the country East West. So

121
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,576
this was sort of the last

122
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:16,330
for the steamboat,

123
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:34,295
and they lasted a few years later, but that race that famous race between the net and the Robert y lee, what really took America by storm and I think it was just so filled with American and his history and so American in its iconic nature Barks could not resist by creating his own little

124
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:44,484
floor. I I love it. Yeah. That's awesome. Thanks so much for sharing that one. That's a great catch. So, you know, I I like this. The the Ducktales are really

125
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,413
intrigued by screws

126
00:15:46,950 --> 00:16:21,173
recount this, and they're, like, encouraging him to to tell them the rest of the story yeah. And and things kinda switch to a halt because Scrooge says that there is no more story. The the race had this really noble end. Where neither of the boats reached the finish line because the cotton queen hit a snag and the river bell. Blew her boilers and and in the flash panel. We see that they were in really close proximity to each other. Oh again this doesn't seem to be like usually if Barks goes into a flash like this in, like

127
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:35,420
the horse rad story, it's gonna be because of, like, some kind of sabotage or something. But but now that That doesn't seem to be the case. And so Screws says that, you know, the boats are still there and that horse shoes proposal

128
00:16:35,974 --> 00:16:54,123
is that the boats be raised and they've brace them all over again because they've inherited these claims and ends hog thinks that that's the only sporting way to settle who's property is. And a warren and this seems really fitting right? Because it seems like what a stereotypical

129
00:16:54,862 --> 00:16:56,401
quote southern gentleman

130
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,357
would would propose. Or at least our our cultural

131
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:04,130
idea of what he would or a fair wear race

132
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:14,984
winner take Al in this case, cor Gables. And and then I had to kinda think a little bit about that original deal that their uncle uncles made that they both own the claim and therefore

133
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,425
we go back to that dog in the nature.

134
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:18,920
Right. Like

135
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:21,376
couldn't Scrooge

136
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:30,870
just just give it to him if he doesn't want it? Exactly. But, of course, Scrooge Mc doc never never gives anything away for free. That's absolutely

137
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:34,457
correct. But don the boys are not very intrigued and

138
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:43,670
the boys get all excited here, you know, what, what what a great prize this mansion and the Southern man. Why don't you erase Al Scrooge? They're just absolutely

139
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:55,090
convinced that he needs to follow through on this. But Scrooge won't have it. Right. Right. And and they kinda plant this little seed. Right? Well Scrooge is like ranting about how

140
00:17:55,905 --> 00:18:07,639
expensive this whole process would be They're talking about how create would be if he could live there like a real southern gentleman if he wanted to race. And and it kinda gets into Scrooge

141
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:12,783
head, you know? And on the next page, he's kinda doing that like far away

142
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:18,585
day dreaming, look. Bark is a really nice job Al training this. And and so he

143
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:20,465
he does. He

144
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:29,398
visualize he thinks about corn Gables Okay. So Warren this this this is the part of the story that I find a little bit uncomfortable.

145
00:18:29,737 --> 00:18:29,777
Okay.

146
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:32,354
I'm just gonna read

147
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:59,036
what Scrooge is thinking to himself. He keep ponder thinking it would be kinda nice to be a southern gentleman. I could wear a big hat and grow go he. And he kind of pictures himself looking a little bit almost, you know, colonel sanders ish. Yeah That type. Right. He says I can see myself now sitting on the veranda Al cor phone Gables, sipping soda and listening to the cotton picker

148
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:00,448
str their band.

149
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:08,124
Yeah. That's where it takes a turn. So, I mean, here's the thing. Right? Like, This is this is

150
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:09,842
a like fund

151
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:11,880
reminiscent of the

152
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:12,719
plantation

153
00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:15,915
ethos. And and I'm sure there a regular

154
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:19,785
nerves who are like, oh oh Barks is gonna go off on one of his, like,

155
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:25,331
socially conscious tangent I I don't really beg

156
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:29,522
for doing this. Like, it it looks to a lot of people,

157
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,895
it feels weird and gross.

158
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,490
Today to kind of like look back with fondness

159
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,810
on on this whole sort of plantation

160
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:55,999
style. Right? People now. Nowadays, you'll see people like, having plantation weddings and when that comes out later, they get... They tend to get a lot of trouble us because we realized what the plantation was built on, Right? It it was built on slavery.

161
00:19:56,536 --> 00:20:04,918
And and there's nothing about that here directly, you know, it's not meant to evo that. It's just it's just unavoidable.

162
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:15,845
Yeah. You Yeah. It's what it is. I understand and and no no. You're you're there's certainly no rant here. I I I think there's a there's a a recall of a time when

163
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:20,310
I I guess I do take issue with the term cotton picker, but that's,

164
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,277
you know, there's so much slang that comes out of that as you know.

165
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:32,605
But his reminiscent with his eyes close is one of of the the sweet south and the music of the salt than that that time. So, yeah, I guess

166
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:33,940
today doesn't hold up.

167
00:20:34,872 --> 00:20:40,676
But back then that's what the... That's what the were. Right. Well, there was like, a whole... I mean, it was

168
00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:43,707
extremely popular in the forties and fifties.

169
00:20:44,179 --> 00:21:03,155
To like, even even the yankee would, they kind of bought into this. Right? The south really sold itself. This this sort of lifestyle after the civil war. It was like this effort to kinda reclaim their heritage away from slavery. It was a bit of a sn ring, but, like, people loved films like

170
00:21:03,573 --> 00:21:08,760
like gone with the winds and song of the south, and there was just this kind of mythology.

171
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,707
So I'm not trying to pick on Barks, like, because

172
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:15,913
everyone did this, but it does look weird to see Scrooge

173
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:18,247
imagining himself as essentially

174
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,958
Al plantation on.

175
00:21:20,677 --> 00:21:31,689
Plantation owner. And that don't forget that Huey, Hollywood musical called Show boat, That was all about the salt and and that the same error. But but I, you know, I had another

176
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:42,393
context on this page, I love it Now Scrooge just Barks and his money then on his on his money having this sort day dream and and... But the idea is now getting into do his head that he can't He cannot

177
00:21:42,891 --> 00:22:01,875
not compete with court with the horseshoe. Right. It it kinda reminds me of that moment and back to the dyke where he kind of like is rem reminiscent, and then he all of a sudden demands to Donald. You know, we going on a journey once he remembered. Because he does the same thing here

178
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:02,835
except

179
00:22:03,215 --> 00:22:22,405
He'll, it'll be a moment before he tells Donald about it. That's. He ends up calling horse shoe hog, and he does this kinda like funny little bit of turn about. Right. He was the one dragging his feet, but now we get the funny comment beat where he he says you can't start until tomorrow while the stalling. You go a chicken or something?

180
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:29,312
A course, you called him chicken earlier and not he's turning the tables on and I love right. And and so basically,

181
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:31,745
the Inducks are off. Scrooge

182
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:55,464
sc does what he usually does with his nephews he ram rides them into joining along another adventure slash treasure hunt slash competition. And he thinks that he has got Al leg up because, you know, he... He's ready to get started on a nice fast plain, and he's... He explains to them on the plane that he's kinda changed

183
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:57,315
the the rules.

184
00:22:57,729 --> 00:23:00,063
We proposed the rules change. What does he

185
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:11,381
suggested now? Yeah. He was able to convince or sure that they... Instead of starting the race over from the original starting line or origin that they're gonna start the boat right from where they are.

186
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,850
You know, and race to the end of the from there. So

187
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,865
they thought that was a good idea. It means that whoever gets his boat out of the mud and get it going first

188
00:23:21,404 --> 00:23:27,259
is that much ahead of the other guy? Right. And I really like this aspect of the story from a story

189
00:23:27,758 --> 00:23:31,470
perspective because it adds a whole new dimension to it, you know? It doesn't...

190
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:43,485
Well like I said earlier, it moves it along it gets you right in the thick of the race right from the beginning instead of having to right deal panels that take you back. So I think it's a wonderful wonderful story point. Yeah. I agree. It's very zip.

191
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:48,565
And so we we see the Ducktales on their plane, and they are

192
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:52,055
overtake by, like, a supersonic jet. And

193
00:23:52,393 --> 00:24:02,090
and in a steward, I would usually say flight attendant, but she is definitely coded one of those nineteen fifties, very elegant very attractive steward.

194
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:02,628
Yeah.

195
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:08,137
Explains to him that it's a rich Sports Inducks jet racing plain

196
00:24:08,835 --> 00:24:31,222
and we learn the predictable it's horseshoe hog bound of Mississippi at seven hundred miles an hour. So, you know, Scrooge, we... Screws gets that moment where he gets kinda knocked off his perch. I like that we hear we hear Horseshoe su hog referred to Al the Rich sports. You know, and puts him in that class, so he's got money. We know that. He can afford this jet this very very futuristic looking

197
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:36,261
I don't know if this is about the time that Chuck Yea broke the sound barrier, but pretty close.

198
00:24:37,236 --> 00:24:38,015
Like that.

199
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:47,740
And he's going at seven hundred miles an hour. So I love Al Scrooge just collapses, and you have that wonderful thought bubble coin with the wings flying away.

200
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:57,529
Yeah And you know, it makes me think that it would be fun to have brought Hog Barks for more of these encounters because, like, the that sort of character

201
00:24:57,985 --> 00:25:02,310
pathology was not really in Scrooge just like, staple of

202
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:07,211
or foil. Right? It does... It brings a bit of a new dimension.

203
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,507
So when the docs arrive at natchez,

204
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:28,857
is Scrooge is really deflate, but he... He's got the old sunk cost fallacy on his mind. Right? When the other Inducks proposed giving up, He's like, I spent a dime for the charts. So we've we've got to get on with it now. It's a great reaction from Donald. There just yeah.

205
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:30,809
Yeah

206
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:40,147
they're on the next panel. They're they're they're on the Mississippi and they come up on the cotton queen and all you can see are the stacks the the stacks from the ship

207
00:25:40,524 --> 00:25:41,878
above the the water line.

208
00:25:42,476 --> 00:25:54,345
Not figure how they're gonna raise it. Yeah. This is This is the part where the other docs learned that Scrooge sk doesn't really have any idea for it. That's what he brought them along for. That's why You're there. Yeah.

209
00:25:55,585 --> 00:25:57,845
But fortunately, he's got, you know, his

210
00:25:58,185 --> 00:25:59,945
ex wood shots along with him.

211
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:13,395
But but before the wood get, we'll get their bright ideas we get to see hog lifting his boat with a couple of crane Barks. What what do you think warren of that That's, like,

212
00:26:14,355 --> 00:27:12,445
wide panel that full with panel of the... Yeah. This The our work here is just stunning I think. I think this is where where where Barks really have fun with with not only the history and and bra is bode but capturing what they might look like after being down in the water for over eighty years and just the... I just love the landscape the birds, the water, the was camp he does his referred for grounding in this panel too. I always like that. And and but no he's using technology. He's showing... And... And I I made a note here that that Barks is the just quintessential teacher. He is teaching history every story almost. And this one has so many facts that he'll point out about how to raise and how to restore and and and... Well, we'll get into the story, but this is the the teacher Barks that I think I was fascinated with his a young boy when I read these stories just to learn more about it. Yeah. It does feel very, like, realistic the mechanics of of all this. Yeah

213
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,420
So, you know, the the...

214
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,840
One of his nephews tells him you better stop pinching pennies here worrying about dimes.

215
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:36,402
Or you're gonna lose the race. And so we get this very, like, important line for the rest of the story where he admits. I guess you're right. But brother, corn pound gables better be worth this money or four bright young Ducktales are gonna have to scatter in Al directions.

216
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:37,935
Yeah.

217
00:27:38,775 --> 00:27:42,835
A physical of cash that he's kinda going through as well. Right. And eventually,

218
00:27:43,215 --> 00:27:49,604
the the Nephews bust out there wood got I book. And they they propose they can get the

219
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:53,276
the ship raised for a thousand bucks

220
00:27:53,654 --> 00:27:55,071
Yeah. Which is only

221
00:27:55,384 --> 00:28:00,484
one of the bills in the in the handful of cash. I just I love that. Yeah. That's true. And warren...

222
00:28:01,082 --> 00:28:02,790
Do you wanna tell us about

223
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:12,003
what they come back with. Well, yeah. They, you know, they're looking over at Horseshoe and his very expensive looking creams and they're they're absolutely

224
00:28:12,462 --> 00:28:17,450
there's a better way to raise boats in their Wood chuck guide book. So they go off Scrooge just

225
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:24,675
creating a worry circle in in the grass there had his own little like a portable worrisome room groove

226
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:26,195
Huey, does.

227
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:30,115
Any he sees he looks off and sees horseshoe making

228
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:34,810
pretty good progress when the Ducktales the boys and Donald come back

229
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:53,249
with a little barge and where's the fancy equipment, There's there's nothing that he thought they would bring back and he says, we've got it on Scrooge, two thousand old entered inner tubes and six miles of bailing wire and this is the the ingenuity that they found by looking through their Guide book. Again. The boys...

230
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:59,842
The resource this is unbelievable here. Right. And so what do we get here warren we get another

231
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:02,014
Boat raising see.

232
00:29:02,351 --> 00:29:05,242
It's not Ping pot bowls this time. No No. It

233
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,469
it's tubes and diving gear and the boys,

234
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:15,101
are now instructing uncle Scrooge as to how they're going to raise this boat. He would Huey, is gonna go down

235
00:29:15,478 --> 00:29:38,705
with air hoses and inflate all the tubes And Dewey and Louie are going to go down and start wrapping the deck with all the the bailing wire. Scrooge just gonna stay on there and his job is to cast off when the cotton queen comes up under the the force of these these boots. But, yeah. This is the... This isn't the first time we've seen this Barks. Right. He he did this several years back

236
00:29:39,165 --> 00:30:08,977
in a pretty famous story called the Sunken yacht it was one of the first ten pager that I covered. Yeah. And this was featured and... This was one... That was one of the, like, Barks and pop culture moments. Right? Because they talked about in popular. Mechanics and on myth busters on the discovery channel and so on. And and it's interesting that this other boat raising technique gets gloss over because I guess Ping polls ping pong balls fire the imagination a little more and and some I'm not actually

237
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:17,092
did it. That's three years later. So, you know, I like this... What I like about the sequence here, Warren is that, like, clog

238
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:23,940
crew, they're they're kinda smuggling watching on. But, again, like, h himself is never

239
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,700
this. I know

240
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,885
there's Just in it. For the race, you know? He is. And is looking on and kinda mild amazement.

241
00:30:31,883 --> 00:30:42,734
And he knows something that the cotton queen was cypress so she'll have a bottom, but only if her nails have rusted away. But look at the look in here his eyes. He's he's looking in in kind of competitive

242
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:51,567
admiration is the already say? Right. And and he is taking his time because he doesn't think much of their their tech needs. That's

243
00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:52,858
But

244
00:30:53,195 --> 00:30:57,461
but again, there's no, like, efforts to sabotage or anything like this.

245
00:30:58,537 --> 00:31:12,228
I did look it up. Apparently Cypress is a very good wood to survive under underwater for a while. So... Good. I think Barks annuity was talking about and we do eventually get a pretty great splash panel

246
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:14,461
where this, like, jury

247
00:31:15,198 --> 00:31:44,900
boat does rise with a with a pretty john t blur sound effect. And it's a very cool panel. We seldom them see half page splash panels of this detail in any of the Ducktales stories. So again, I think I'm I'm really attracted to these great None, there's there's not a spoken word in them. Just... It's this story that now it's up and now the race must begin, and I just... I just love this. Right. Boy Bark just he loves

248
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,040
to draw boats.

249
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,480
She boats and ringing,

250
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,460
mass Al every every

251
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:59,968
opportunity he can. You know so the Inducks could continue to secure it. We get a great little comic beef here where yeah. Rising boat has

252
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:09,784
stuff screwed on his little ski boat because you forgot to cast off. That's a great comic bit. And, again, the artwork work here is just fascinating every every

253
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:17,376
line of wires is drawn to detail. And... Yeah. And if you look carefully, it is every line of wire is holding down

254
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,270
in inner tube, and it's just... It's got all of the

255
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:27,962
underwater Lg and c wait or whatever you wanna call that. That would have been down there. I just did just really a beautiful

256
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:34,817
beautiful panel And so the next sequence is gonna basically be all about the Ducktales efforts

257
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:47,276
inside the interior of the newly raised ship. Trying to clean it up trying to get it shipped shape. There's there's some really funny common beads here where Scrooge gets covered in a pile of cat.

258
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:47,813
Yeah.

259
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:57,858
Are you a catfish fan, warren? Well, I love eating catfish. I have right. And that's what I'm Al. Yeah I I actually... I've haven't caught, but...

260
00:32:58,235 --> 00:33:08,674
But I literally like cat good. So if you live near the Mississippi in in the Southern states, Catfish is always on the menu. Yeah. It's easy to get... When I visit my my folks and arkansas,

261
00:33:09,131 --> 00:33:11,798
it's easy to get cats fish. Does does Catfish

262
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:13,552
on the menu extend

263
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:23,265
that high up the Mississippi? Only on rare occasions. I'd say probably past Saint. Louis, you aren't gonna find it very much. Yeah. It's probably not much of a yankee thing. But I

264
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:46,175
Barks is technique care of teaching, you know, the brass doesn't rust. So the the the the cotton queens engine our brass. And then, of course, he opens it up, and then that's when the cap is running, but I can... I just... I'm just fascinated by the detail of everything from the, you know the prep... Prepping it and getting it all set Yeah. And I mean, we've got a little bit of hand waving. It's it's awfully easy to get this

265
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:50,897
old sunken River boat in running shape. But Bet it's like

266
00:33:51,553 --> 00:33:55,421
logic approach. Oh, I'll buy it for this story. Yeah. Yeah. Likewise.

267
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:59,891
And and then we get kind of the last important element of the story

268
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:08,016
introduced. Do you wanna tell us about Scrooge allergy here? Yeah. This is where we are see a kind of a late story running gag here. He

269
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:13,145
he'll see if there's anything aboard that they can burn for fuel and he finds these barrels

270
00:34:14,043 --> 00:34:49,755
is Hickory, not... It says no hickory nuts. Nothing but these barrels of crust m molasses or something, and then he starts sneezing. And this is, you know, really a funny sequence here because that one seen on that page where he sneezes any Barks into the barrel with this eyeglasses and this hat flying off is just really wonderful. Yeah. The fun one. But but but sort of his allergies and the must smell don't go together. And he's not he's not Al it very well here, but we see this a time and again throughout the story here. Right. And he allude to being allergic the must smells

271
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:59,007
like like the bottom of his money bin. Yeah. I yeah. And and these barrels end up being pitch, which is a perfect fuel. Mh. And

272
00:35:00,385 --> 00:35:13,377
I think at the end of this page, hog notices that they're firing up their boilers, and he's despair because, you know, his crew is telling them they're not ready. They they've gotta a finish bolt the engines in their hold.

273
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:25,175
And and so the Ducktales they get off to an early lead. I do Like Barks does this this really funny thing that he likes to do where... It almost doesn't matter

274
00:35:25,635 --> 00:35:29,296
who gets off to a quicker start because he's gonna

275
00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:32,988
he's gonna throw all these little random obstacles

276
00:35:33,486 --> 00:36:01,561
that's just gonna keep turning the tide of of who's ahead in the competition. So that you you can't... It just makes it so unpredictable. It's very Barks to me. I like it a lot. Back and forth, and I don't know if the rule of three applies here, but I think it might bump they'll go back and forth, you know, two or three, four times before We have an outcome here. Yeah. They keep exchanging the lead and and we get the the the running bit where screw ends up sneezing through his river chart.

277
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:18,453
They end up, they end up losing some time to go back for it. And even though they even know they find the the missing map and, you know, the map that blew out from the sneeze, they put it back and then of course... Well, that that that map was from eighteen Severino.

278
00:36:18,273 --> 00:36:18,773
So

279
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:24,341
Right. It leads them to a dead and channel. And we get... We get one of Barks

280
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:27,770
classic Scrooge is so cheap

281
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:36,516
gag. You wanna tell us I... Well, he says, look, it it only cost to dime the new ones dog on it. It it would cost me a whole dollar. And just

282
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:37,393
classic.

283
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:42,258
It it is classic. I'm I'm sure it's a little bit eye rolling, but

284
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:51,896
but those of us who love the Scrooge stories love this this kind of thing. I I really like the bit of writing a little bit a few panels back to her

285
00:36:52,236 --> 00:36:56,536
points out that the boiler is leaking badly and he asks Louis if the

286
00:36:56,956 --> 00:37:03,151
guide book says what to do about boilers in that condition and Louis just just proactively

287
00:37:03,491 --> 00:37:06,211
it says to jump overboard and swim for your life.

288
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,958
Tables within my grass.

289
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:21,441
But. That is a great, and I'm sorry. I missed that earlier. But, yeah, I kinda skipped over that to get to the fives. I love that. That that's one of my favorite bits of writing. One my favorite gag

290
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:24,609
so the the race kinda

291
00:37:24,948 --> 00:37:25,448
continues.

292
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:36,395
I guess really, it just gets underway because the the docks have to... They have to turn all the way back basically to where they began. Because with this achievements.

293
00:37:36,892 --> 00:38:20,398
Yeah. Yep. And Hog is the hog and the his river bell have just finally gotten underway. And at this point, the Ducktales have totally run out of pitch. That's right. Yeah. It rip up the cabins and the deck nails, the sun's dried them enough to burden them by now. You know, And so now there... The the desperation is really kicked in because, again, horseshoe is taking over the lead. So what a fix were in, but he starts sneezing again and the course he rips the the wheel right off of the the boat. Right. He ends up wearing the ships wheel and the do do the kind kind of predictable thing where they use the wood of the boat, it cell for fuel. And Hog points out that, you know, the lighter the boat gets the faster she goes

294
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:24,990
So he switches, he orders them to give it full throttle,

295
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,265
and what happens when I give it full throttle. Oh, I'm fortunately,

296
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:30,420
horseshoe logs boat,

297
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:33,113
basically just basically splits in half.

298
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:36,980
He knew that the new engine was too powerful for this old rotten

299
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,900
Serves says one of the deck.

300
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:51,968
Never mind the race isn't over, Not until the cotton queen reaches the finish line at the end of the boy up head. Yeah. So we've got this great... Again, this is very Barks. Right? Where where a race is gonna

301
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,954
come down to this kind of pathetic, like,

302
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:58,049
staggering to the end conclusion.

303
00:38:58,387 --> 00:39:09,710
Yeah. I got a sense that the Cotton queen is just drifting right now. Right. Right. It's very pathetic. They're both basically coming to a halt right before the finish line. What it it.

304
00:39:10,366 --> 00:39:10,446
Yeah.

305
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:17,640
Yeah, just twenty feet away, and and the Inducks run out of wood and and then and then Barb

306
00:39:18,435 --> 00:39:52,042
got c for a warranty and tell us about how the running gag comes back into play. Well, now this sneezing couldn't happen at a better time because is is Scrooge kind of gears up for that big sneeze from his allergic reaction to must places. It pushes that final two pushes him right over the finish line. And then we see this this horrible rec of ship make it and, of course they all they're all happy. And we... It takes us right to corn home Gables Barks take us home. Right. Yeah. I I love that. Right? He sneeze is right into the paddle wheel. It's totally cartoon logic.

307
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:55,902
Yeah. Yep. And and as you mentioned, the Ducktales

308
00:39:55,902 --> 00:40:00,688
they are victoria since Scrooge does win the full title to corn Gables,

309
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:07,987
and he approaches it in a very excited manner saying he can't wait to move in and become a southern gentleman.

310
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:19,435
And and I I don't like these moments where characters are kind of proposing to like, abandoned, what makes them them. I think that's probably one of the things I didn't like this

311
00:40:19,815 --> 00:40:31,515
about this is a kid. I just I want screws to always be like, because rich tay himself. But Right. But anyways it's he has to be excited for the sake of this final gag

312
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:36,555
where where he opens the door, and the the mansion is looking

313
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:37,435
extremely.

314
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:43,755
He He comments kind of off offhand but, yes. It it does smell a bit

315
00:40:44,252 --> 00:40:44,752
must.

316
00:40:45,248 --> 00:40:54,888
And how does it wrap up or? Well, we thought that we saw the final sneeze but not quite... This this sneeze breaks down the entire corn phone Gables mansion

317
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,654
and then he races off after the Inducks

318
00:40:58,191 --> 00:40:58,550
basically.

319
00:40:59,865 --> 00:41:05,844
Right. It it feels like that last niece should've have been the really big, like, comic cap

320
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:21,581
finale of that, that running gag but Barks gets in another great one here. He does. And it it really ends with a callback. To that panel where he says, you know, this mansion better be all it's crap up to be your I'm gonna chase you off into the four foreclosure.

321
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:22,855
Yeah. It

322
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:28,707
There it is. Warren. This is like a john t brisk b story.

323
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,012
It's very satisfying. Right? Yeah. I mean, we we get to meet

324
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,888
this non villainous

325
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:41,809
adversary who seems to be a a a fair sport, the southern gentleman and Horseshoe Hog.

326
00:41:42,346 --> 00:41:57,396
I agree. I wish I could have seen him in other stories. But if we get Al little taste of the Mississippi and Al little bit of history with steamboat and the romance of that era. And the racing, and we now know that it was tied to an actual lace in eighteen seventy.

327
00:41:57,935 --> 00:42:07,522
But just a nice little Ducktales. Yeah. Yeah. I I think so. It's it's never... It's never been one of my favorite as I mentioned, but it is like a very satisfying

328
00:42:07,979 --> 00:42:13,515
tight little story that the steaks are much lower and most of the stories

329
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:41,401
from from the Scrooge adventures around this era. I mean, he's not gonna fortune here. This is not losing a fortune it's about gaining a house that he's interested in perhaps moving to. And I never... I never thought of him a abandoning Duck and the money bin. I always I kinda looked at this as a summer vacation home that he would wanna go visit, I and I could buy that. Sure. I could see that. I could also see on getting, like, incredibly bored after like two days and.

330
00:42:42,421 --> 00:42:44,481
And abandoned cor Pound Gables

331
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:57,578
Can I say it by the way that the name of that mansion is outstanding? Yeah. But what do you would what you hear the word corn phone? What is that say? I mean, corn pound is just one of those, like, very stereotypical,

332
00:42:58,153 --> 00:42:59,012
like, Uber

333
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:09,869
American south things to say. We we talk about, like, the southern accent, literally being corn phones. Oh yeah. We. Baby. Yeah. It's very funny.

334
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:13,225
There's some sharp writing in this one. It's always

335
00:43:13,565 --> 00:43:15,343
great to keep him drawing

336
00:43:15,682 --> 00:43:17,076
vessel. He's just

337
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:35,876
So you you can tell the the joy that that it brings him to to t boats. I think drawing the boats and they and a wonderful half page splash panel with the the boat surfacing to the kind queen coming up is just brilliant and again, it it reinforces what you just said. He loves

338
00:43:36,295 --> 00:43:38,670
drawing these these vessels. And

339
00:43:39,127 --> 00:43:58,967
and it loves the Ducktales these these, but I would call American adventures. You know. Right. Their whole... Yeah. This is one of the stories that really points out that despite being like a scottish Inducks. Scrooge is, like profoundly America Yeah. And I think we're we're hitting a stride here and and other stories after fifty five where I think Scrooge

340
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:10,697
we can talk about this, but might be at the peak of his of his character development now. He's he's getting there. He's maybe not quite, but he's we're seeing some of these other family

341
00:44:11,074 --> 00:44:11,574
history

342
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:19,059
memories come back. We're seeing some of these wonderful adventures that are have within the country, not necessarily in in Ducktales.

343
00:44:20,016 --> 00:44:27,786
But, yeah. I I I... We're really kind of seeing screws now kinda fully developed your Yeah. I I think to my eye, he is basically

344
00:44:28,203 --> 00:44:30,755
fully developed. Okay. At this point.

345
00:44:31,393 --> 00:44:50,006
I mean, that's just where I am. I don't I don't think there's much more evolution left in the character, but I'll be interesting to pay attention to is as we continue to go along. Yeah. I think you're right. I think I think he's about as far as you're gonna go, but this... But probably peaked in the in that fifty two a fifty five time period. Right.

346
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:52,915
So let's talk about the critical

347
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:53,752
consensus

348
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,683
on this one One because index.

349
00:44:57,242 --> 00:45:14,643
Index which, of course, is the site where users can rank and vote on the stories. And, you know, it's not gas or anything, but it does give us a pretty good idea of what the community thinks about it. So out of ten, this one gets a seven point seven.

350
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:26,807
Which is good for number one hundred and thirty nine. Out all forty two thousand or so stories that are ranked on Inducks. So that's like a a very well ranked story

351
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:29,304
for Barks.

352
00:45:29,264 --> 00:46:05,080
It is... I would say kind of pretty good. So this is a pretty average story among Barks adventure stories. It's still, like, it's still is is considered great, compared to most, you know, other created. I think that's about right. I think this... I personally think this is a pretty average story. But again, it's not one that I read early on, so it does have, like an Al hold for me. Sounds like you'd probably rank it as kind of a personal favorite. Maybe it's got a bit of an nostalgic. I think that is nostalgic part is what what I I talked about first. And also aligns with another

353
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:19,656
important piece of Disney history. If you think about the release date of this in September of nineteen fifty five. I would imagine that Barks wrote this earlier that year. Is that correct? Oh, yeah. I think so. Let's see. This one was written

354
00:46:19,994 --> 00:46:21,251
in February.

355
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:25,598
Fifty five. So while February of fifty five, remember

356
00:46:26,295 --> 00:46:32,400
Disneyland was being built at the time And so we have that Disneyland built in one year and one day. And and

357
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:34,637
and and so Barks certainly working

358
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:57,003
as an artist in Southern California knew about this and adventure, this is this venture. And and I think the whole eighteen seventy steamboat race plus There was no secret that the Mark twain, the Disney steamboat at Disneyland was going to launch on July seventeenth nineteen fifty five, There's Al these wonderful which I like is sort of the the historical

359
00:46:57,459 --> 00:47:09,435
placement of where these events occurred. And those this story was timed, I think really nice to the opening of Disneyland. Yeah, that's a good point. I'm glad you pointed that out. And and, you know, really, it's it's hard to

360
00:47:09,776 --> 00:47:12,995
remember about like, the Barks twain stories they figured

361
00:47:13,309 --> 00:47:24,356
so prominently. I mean, they're they still do. Right? It's he's he's a great American story but I I definitely feel like in the fifties, those were a lot more salient

362
00:47:24,735 --> 00:47:27,435
Al time. Yeah. And I also think this story

363
00:47:27,856 --> 00:47:29,155
as I read it again

364
00:47:29,536 --> 00:47:57,840
for the first time in a long time, and I really I get brought Barks memories, which is kinda what I'm talking about. I think it would have been a great animated cartoon. I really think this would have a great card too and it right at the Huey, day of Donald Barks in the fifties too. But it it didn't. And and I think it's placement in in sort of that index universe is is very fair. I think it say, it's it better than I would call a better than typical story. Sure. Yeah. I won't argue. This would this this seems right for

365
00:47:58,355 --> 00:47:58,855
for

366
00:47:59,194 --> 00:47:59,694
animated

367
00:48:00,073 --> 00:48:01,632
adaptation. You know, you mentioned

368
00:48:02,151 --> 00:48:03,610
Disneyland. We we

369
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:07,326
we should not fail to point out the

370
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,300
the other

371
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,360
Karl Barks

372
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:10,580
river

373
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,580
race

374
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,460
story, right, which was in the

375
00:48:15,895 --> 00:48:23,432
the the weird uncle Scrooge coast to Land. Yeah. I have that original del too, and you've got the the great reprint there.

376
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:29,697
Yeah. What was that Right. Called again. And and that was called. I think that's called the

377
00:48:30,036 --> 00:48:34,771
fantastic river rate. There you go. And that literally was meant to celebrate.

378
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,106
Disney disneyland.

379
00:48:36,686 --> 00:48:38,826
Yeah. So, yeah. Like, Barks did

380
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:41,986
he did a couple of great

381
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:47,055
river race stories. That one's a little bit odd a little bit unique but that is still a great read.

382
00:48:47,814 --> 00:48:48,314
And

383
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:50,072
yeah, very memorable.

384
00:48:50,811 --> 00:49:05,205
Let's talk about kind of the legacy of this story. More, I would say that this one really has kind of a big after life for, like, a a little sixteen page are you know? Mh. I think so. So this

385
00:49:05,661 --> 00:49:06,161
story

386
00:49:06,897 --> 00:49:07,835
despite being

387
00:49:08,252 --> 00:49:10,084
again, pretty john tea.

388
00:49:10,423 --> 00:49:14,258
This this ended up being a a huge part of the Barks.

389
00:49:14,697 --> 00:49:15,756
For Dawn roses

390
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:24,632
big project, the life and times of Scrooge dot a lot of his, like, second chapter, the master of the Mississippi

391
00:49:25,025 --> 00:49:28,581
story was based on the events from this Scrooge

392
00:49:29,101 --> 00:49:29,601
recollection,

393
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,876
and also that other river boat story, the fantastic river race.

394
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,690
But arose that took a lot from from those

395
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:43,945
to to develop. Gross other artists who who followed in this these footsteps really did

396
00:49:44,444 --> 00:50:10,221
pay homage to the to the Boat story here. And I think, you know, this is the basis. This was the groundwork. The set the set the stage. And, again, I just... I would say it's because it's a great American adventure. And it stands to reason that people would be nostalgic for this earlier time. And American history in the post work here. I agree. The the last thing I'll mention as far as adaptations is that this story did get a a pretty

397
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,140
brief

398
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,961
sort of Ducktales.

399
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:45,837
I that... Okay. Yeah. What one of the episodes from the first run of the series dime enough for luck. It's kind of like it's meant to be sort of recount how Scrooge made his fortune and and got his number one dime. I would say it is not one of the series best episodes. But the the the little brief sequence that adapts this. Is this... It's probably the strongest part of the story. And, you know, it it literally does name check corn pound Gables. Well, it does.

400
00:50:46,196 --> 00:50:49,806
Yeah. Then I did actually become a bit of an animated film.

401
00:50:50,821 --> 00:50:53,993
Yeah. I it wouldn't it would definitely wouldn't leave you satisfied.

402
00:50:54,744 --> 00:51:03,896
Okay. But but it was cool to see it. You know, that they've been that weird early nineties animated way, the boats, like, are moving on nash. Shirley. Oh Barks hated.

403
00:51:04,535 --> 00:51:04,974
But anyway,

404
00:51:06,491 --> 00:51:10,863
gotta mention it. Yeah. No no oil paintings that I'm aware of or

405
00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:13,314
or anything. For this. No. So...

406
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:23,600
Yeah. You know, it's a short story, so there may not be as much to say about it. But it's definitely a fun one I am pleased to have revisit.

407
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:29,214
Yeah. It was fun. I... Again, the the the splash panel there that we talked about very memorable.

408
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,967
The artwork on the river, the the

409
00:51:32,544 --> 00:51:33,802
attention to detail

410
00:51:34,578 --> 00:51:35,637
of the steamboat

411
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:39,286
and their their structure, and even they're rebuilding

412
00:51:39,785 --> 00:51:48,835
He he didn't cut corners there. And and then, of course, he knows has a beautiful... It's a wonderful story. He knows how to add those gigs, the the sneezing of Scrooge

413
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:51,015
and establishing that wonderful

414
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:55,890
rivalry read between him and this new great new character horseshoe hog. Right. For sure.

415
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:00,270
You wanna hit us with the one or two favorite panels that we didn't mention?

416
00:52:00,904 --> 00:52:00,984
Yeah.

417
00:52:01,742 --> 00:52:02,242
Sure.

418
00:52:02,939 --> 00:52:05,435
Well, I think when I look back at memorable panels,

419
00:52:06,571 --> 00:52:13,100
I I I'll repeat again that that the the the clean coming up above surfacing is is wonderful.

420
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:49,872
I do really like the the joke... The the the sneeze of Scrooge just going back into that barrel of pitch. I think that a wonderful piece of our work. I get I love it when he exaggerate that the form of of of the the Inducks. Those are those are fun. Yeah. That's an excellent one. And and as you say, there's a few of them that are pretty obvious. So I I'll go to a couple of less obvious ones. Yeah. Would get like the one where one of the nephews is lever himself against the machinery of the engine as they get it started. I think that just looks really neat. He's like full on horizontal

421
00:52:50,209 --> 00:53:00,258
And then I I like Scrooge under the pile of cash fish. And you mentioned the Nephews and the the one shot of of... I can't remember which Nephew it was.

422
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:12,235
Oh, he's in the office at the beginning of the story. And it's it's the nephew leaning on a cane like a little southern gentleman. That is cute. That's that's cute. I I love to see him up there. Excellent.

423
00:53:12,615 --> 00:53:16,850
Well, warren, thank you so much for joining me for this office so.

424
