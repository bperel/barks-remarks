00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:09,384
We have

2
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:32,244
Hello, and welcome to Barks Remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comics of all time. This episode is a ten page podcast, all about one of his short stories. Get ready to enjoy our remarks.

3
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,840
Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever

4
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,140
Grown man who enjoys dot con, and I'm joined by Austin Kelly.

5
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:52,220
Say hello the nice people, Austin. Hi everybody. And hap happy summer to you and to our listeners. We're we're recording this in early June

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,900
almost at summer. And

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,580
we've got a summer themed

8
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:01,444
episode for today, this this episode of the ten page podcast.

9
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:06,965
Austin, how do you feel about summer? Summer in general. Yeah. I really like summer. I mean,

10
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:25,966
the weird thing is where I come from in Manhattan. Everyone seems to be a winter person just because we only get snow like, twice a year there. But I really like summer, especially because it's just three months where I get to do. Whatever I want reading Barks comics. Yeah. Absolutely. I... My my child summers were definitely filled with a lot of these. And

11
00:01:26,342 --> 00:01:28,674
and I grew up in the Bay area.

12
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:34,632
So we'd spend a lot of time at the beach and And, of course, it's very natural when you

13
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:56,297
write for comments when you do our for com, you want those seasonal hook Right? So Barks, I I assume by specific request or or just this was understood to be true. You would you would submit your summer themed stories in time for publication, you would submit Christmas themed stories and time for the holidays.

14
00:01:56,676 --> 00:02:13,779
And and, you know, we we've got three months of summer. So that means that we... That Carl Barks ended up doing up a pretty decent number of summer themed stories, and I think a lot of summer covers. Oh, yeah. A bunch of those. Yeah. I can think of a few famous.

15
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:15,716
I like the famous

16
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,963
Saint Bernard cover delivering

17
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,751
delivering a cold drink if I remembering. Right. Oh, yeah. That was one of his

18
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:29,358
first, I think. My have been is first for the the Walt see title, actually. Yeah. It might have been.

19
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:34,800
So anyway, I've I've been dancing around it, but I very the lead. We get to cover

20
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:36,355
among three

21
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:43,967
great summer stories. Covering one of his most legendary ten pages day, which is pool Barks.

22
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:48,555
And and I'm I'm so excited to talk about this one Austin.

23
00:02:49,008 --> 00:03:14,484
Yeah. I I have to say the same. I was just looking through it today, and it is just so brilliant. Like, it's such a I made the hemingway connection before we recorded it, but it's like such a simple table with such light dialogue, but it can base such a funny message. It's a really great piece. Oh, yeah. This... It's really an art showcase. Right? So which which is a problem for an audio

24
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:35,525
format like ours. We're gonna commit that cardinal of just talking about great art. But it's it's also incredibly sharp riding and and pasting and plotting. So yeah, pool Barks is gonna be our kind of features story. But we do have a couple of other great summer stories to talk about. We're gonna be covering

25
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:38,255
as well one called swimming,

26
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:45,329
sw doors. And then another one called house boat Holiday. We've got some some nice

27
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:47,504
in those titles there.

28
00:03:48,202 --> 00:04:04,711
And, of course, you know, those titles are all titles that have been made after the fact. Right? These these ten pager were originally un title. Think my original printing of pool Barks is actually called the swimming pool at the time of the Gladstone.

29
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,098
Reprint and Donald number two hundred and seventy four, via Gladstone

30
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:16,324
gave a lot of their own titles to the Barks ten pages for whatever reason,

31
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:32,550
there are one of course like Pool ox that are used widely now. I don't know when or by who they were conceived, but I guess if they were around by the late eighties or by done two seventy four Gladstone for whatever reason just use their own title. Yeah. I I think they ended up qualifying them.

32
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:44,449
I always laugh a little bit because I imagine like, a bunch of Barks sk sitting around a a table and debating. Okay. That the statue story who's got a good statue plan Statue spend trips.

33
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:47,344
But I think they were like quote

34
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:48,635
around

35
00:04:49,134 --> 00:05:04,061
publication of the Carl Barks library, but... But I'm not sure. I I... I know I asked someone about that and had answer some point forgotten about it. But let's see. Swimming sw. My my reprint of that one calls it

36
00:05:04,414 --> 00:05:04,914
hun

37
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:11,649
advice, and yeah. I think swimming sw wears is a little more solid. Yeah. Hunt advice is a little more straightforward.

38
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,180
Swimming sw just sounds,

39
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:23,473
which is deserves the title for a goofy story. Right. And then the house holiday by the time I read that in the Disney comics

40
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:29,719
publication, that's the title that they landed on, and that that one Barks it straightforward, but it's alert

41
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:30,638
literate.

42
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:34,254
And and of course, there's a bunch of other great Barks

43
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:40,325
some stories that weren't not gonna get to talk about in this one. You and I debated

44
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:41,365
Lifeguard

45
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:53,300
days. Do you wanna mention kind of the notable thing about that one really quick, so we just kinda check it off. Yeah. I actually haven't read it before, but I remember hearing about

46
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:01,675
this female lifeguard that was in the story, who bark Drew like very largely like the chest was clearly

47
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:20,378
inflated to the point of like there's a scene a famous scene where she's kissing Donald and like, her chest is touching his and he's like oh, you know, like, frozen and stuff and stuff. And you can actually look at the drawing and can see like they cut it down. So she's like, very skinny and tiny, like, the published version, which is, like, super weird. Yes.

48
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:27,083
Yeah. I mean, it's weird I think in in both since is right, this, like, duct character that's given

49
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:31,594
given a bust and then the awkward sensor version.

50
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:39,310
Yeah. You know, I don't that one either? I think I... I've seen I've seen that talked about and that, like, as an example of censorship,

51
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:47,000
but I've never read it. I don't think I've read it myself. So since the of us has it, we don't get to cover it today, but

52
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:47,780
unfortunately.

53
00:06:48,194 --> 00:07:16,050
Yeah. Although I do think it's probably worth checking out because I think there's a senior where he beats up a shark or something. Which would probably be good to look at. Yeah. Yeah. I I know the cover of that one, I've seen it. I've seen the recovery produced. It was the one picked for the Barks Library Album that that story was featured in. So happening. Yeah, I'll I have to keep an eye out for that. And then let's see. There's a number of other great summer stories. I covered the vacation time, of course and one of the regular

54
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:35,932
episodes. That's an all time great summer story that we won't be covering on the ten page podcast. Probably a number of other ones that would fit the definition. But but for our purposes today, those are the three that we're talking about. They were all of course, originally published in walt Disney comics and stories.

55
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,780
So let's go ahead and start. We are... We are giving pool Barks

56
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:41,934
the

57
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:55,510
the headline story feature, the main story feature. So we're gonna we're gonna start off with that one, which was published in Walt Disney Conference and store one hundred and twenty nine in June of nineteen fifty one.

58
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,860
And this is a very highly rated ten pager

59
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:15,180
Inducks, it gets a seven point six out of ten, which right now is good for number one hundred and seventy one out of all forty one thousand some Disney comments. That are rated. Right. So the this may not be current.

60
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:16,452
Right. But

61
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:28,344
some months ago, I kinda pulled out the ten pager that were highest rated one Inducks. Just to see kind where they compared it against each other. And at that time,

62
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:47,405
pool sharp so, yeah. This is probably pretty close because it was one seventy three at the time. Pool sharp crack the top ten for all time greatest Pearl Barks ten pager. It was the tenth greatest when I made my little spreadsheet sheet. I think that that's totally accurate. I think this is an all time class. Absolutely.

63
00:08:47,782 --> 00:08:51,690
You know respect. So I'm gonna run my hands together in anticipation.

64
00:08:52,622 --> 00:09:08,542
And I'm gonna open up the story. Austin, this this first page of of the story pool Barks is I think a masterpiece piece. It... The the whole story is great throughout. But the the first page might really be the stand page.

65
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:13,841
We've got the basically, the story opens with Donald

66
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:15,555
just frantically

67
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:17,708
working in his garden.

68
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:29,985
It's it's all of the worst stuff about being a gardener. It's fitting pests. It's it's trying to keep ver out of your gardening and and every every panel

69
00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:34,585
in this has Donald in some sort of like wonderful

70
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:36,476
friend motion.

71
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:37,673
It is

72
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:40,743
so funny to see him

73
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:42,497
fighting off weeds

74
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:45,822
spraying for bugs kicking out of chicken

75
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,474
pursuing a go for with a sling shot.

76
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:53,526
And and the whole time his thought process just

77
00:09:53,999 --> 00:10:02,690
complaining about how unpleasant this is. And at the end of the page, he starts to ponder the fact that smart people don't have gardens

78
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:05,418
they use their backyard to play in.

79
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:12,597
They have tennis ports and swimming pools and you you see that he just hasn't a epiphany.

80
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,510
Right there, and he thinks from himself did I say swimming pools?

81
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:28,717
Well, what what your thoughts about this. The so austin. I totally agree that, like, this is one of the stand pages. I always loved Barks has sense closing

82
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:31,884
and just every pose here is so powerful

83
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:33,640
and, like, so exaggerated

84
00:10:34,297 --> 00:10:38,603
And it is really funny. Like, it's just set up that he's like this typical

85
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:47,297
tired, like working guy. Like, all he can do is, like, run around and complain. And I think it sets up the story perfectly

86
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,266
like, really well.

87
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:49,762
Yeah.

88
00:10:50,719 --> 00:11:02,358
It it strikes me too that not to get deep. This is a very surface level story but I I feel like it's also really at the outbreak of the fifties, this is about, like, modern suburb.

89
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:05,867
Right? And the and the things that people do with their backyard

90
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:12,182
one of the first Barks stories that he ever did was the victory Garden. Right? And that's like this

91
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:28,560
utilitarian look at how to use your backyard and And here he's like, well, I I can use my backyard for fun. And that's what was really happening. People, it was kind of the the dawn of, like, barbecue culture and lawn care culture in the American suburbs.

92
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:49,651
Yeah. Tell us about tell us Tell us about after Donald has epiphany. Yeah. So Donald standing around in the garden, and he's thinking really hard and you guys is great image of a pool in his yard, and there's a brilliant device by bark to get rid of the nephews for the story because they really just wouldn't fit where they're off summer camp for two weeks.

93
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:54,175
So they walk off and they noticed that he's off a trans thinking about something.

94
00:11:54,734 --> 00:12:00,519
And Donald starts frantically pointing around and a great multiples sort of smear posts,

95
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:13,285
you know? Kinda and I think of that before, the diving board can be there where the cabbage are the dressing rooms in the artichoke show. So he picks up the phone. The calls a guy over and he selects the the pool type that's oh June moon Leg lagoon.

96
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:17,708
And he gets ready for it. He starts to get building. And what I find interesting

97
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:18,404
is, like,

98
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:22,054
I always wanted how Barks could pack in so

99
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:26,975
much like an in of story and character in ten pages.

100
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:52,792
And it's like, in the last three alone, Like, he calls up a guy, and there's no, like transition or anything that says like, later or like, soon, like the guy just shows up and he selects the pool and he's off building, like, what didn't mess around, like, everything happens so fast especially in pool Barks to the point where like, it's real... It can be hard to keep up with the action, which I think is like, speaks to his skill for storytelling.

101
00:12:53,490 --> 00:13:00,164
Yeah. You're They're absolutely right. You get like some real web whiplash in this story. But made in a good way. The pacing

102
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:16,124
is amazing. It's frantic. It gives you an idea of how quickly Donald had this idea and how quickly he wants to put it in action and and you're right that that salesman like shows up there. For just a single panel that I can see his whole backstory.

103
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:27,046
I can see that he's like you you can see the delight written on his face that he doesn't need this sell. He need to convince this guy. He's just gonna sell him this

104
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,561
super deluxe.

105
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:32,683
The June moon look lagoon. I mean, that's sounds

106
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,114
perfectly brand. That's absolutely

107
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,947
something that one of these

108
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:39,178
companies would have in their catalog.

109
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:44,493
And and you pointed it out, you're you're so right. Bark needs the nephews

110
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:51,371
to be away, both because it it it sets up the great kind of comedic premise

111
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,805
of of the story and it and it's gonna set us up for the the ending

112
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,711
but also, they're they're the voice of reason.

113
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,423
Right? And and without them around,

114
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:06,512
Donald is kind of free to make these mistakes.

115
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:07,684
And

116
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:13,684
we're also free to see Donald dealing with like one of the worst things

117
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:17,697
a parent can deal with. Other people's children.

118
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:20,470
I I I am a parent,

119
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:24,723
and and I I also work with kids. So I love kids, but then

120
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:29,055
sometimes, other people's children are just so unpleasant

121
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:30,175
because

122
00:14:31,074 --> 00:14:38,541
you don't have to deal with them. You're not responsible for them. So A lot of the comedy and the rest of this is gonna... Is gonna

123
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:45,940
show, you know, showcase how Donald deals with that. But but you had mentioned in that first page all of those poses

124
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:49,175
in service of hit his frantic

125
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,987
dealing with the the garden.

126
00:14:52,366 --> 00:15:02,969
Now we have all of these wild poses that are reflecting his excitement and and it's It's just amazing, which is beautiful. I mean, it's just I can to look at.

127
00:15:03,608 --> 00:15:19,366
Like, Barks new, it's just so lovely that he could draw a pose that told the story as much as the dialogue told the story, which I think is really cool. Right. Right. Like, like, take the take the panel where he's reflecting

128
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:21,559
in this, like, days

129
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:25,166
a swimming pool. You know, Barks

130
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:28,037
he does. He puts so much.

131
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:33,030
He packed so much into that panel, that realization that Donald has

132
00:15:33,344 --> 00:15:40,415
that epiphany that, like, far off look where he can imagine and enjoying himself Al summer. I so great.

133
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:47,649
So on the third page, you know, things continue to move quickly, we get a couple of great panels showing

134
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,570
construction.

135
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,322
Of the pool Barks

136
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:51,422
really

137
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:52,261
really

138
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:58,670
summarizes it as the artichoke choke go and in their place and their places rise Cabana.

139
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:00,910
How we get a really lovely

140
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,230
panel

141
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,509
showcasing his new

142
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:05,485
backyard.

143
00:16:05,825 --> 00:16:10,185
It looks really cool. It it's definitely got that fifties look.

144
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,985
It looks like it cost a small fortune.

145
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:27,039
I thought the same thing. I was wondering where Donald even got the money to do this in the first place. Right. I almost thought I I read over some sort of x explanation, like you know, like, my uncle screws left me some inheritance or something.

146
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:29,915
But, you know, whatever logical plot

147
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:31,766
Right. Barks needs

148
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:39,122
needs money to not be an issue. Usually money is like a limiting factor in and these stories it's it's not gonna be here.

149
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:45,925
And and so Donald gets really excited. He had admire, this gorgeous just new pool and he gets ready to jump in.

150
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:59,845
And and he talks about putting on his suit as he starts to take off his sure. We definitely get some of that like the thing that everyone loves to point out, you know, Donald Inducks wearing a bathing suit and any time that he's

151
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:07,928
everyone's fascinated with the idea that Donald Duck doesn't work pants. Right. So there tend to be people who who noticed so he's gonna put on a swimsuit.

152
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:13,391
And and just as he's about to go in, he gets interrupted by

153
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:14,762
Couple of just

154
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:15,679
adorable

155
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:20,841
harmless looking little children and one of whom speaks willow lisbon says,

156
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:22,537
mister Dot

157
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:30,890
and and they plead to have one teeny wee little swim in his awful party pool.

158
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,085
And and so Donald, you know, ru

159
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:40,305
says okay. Which I find interesting because it seems a little out of character for him to be that willing.

160
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,360
But I it does have a hard after all.

161
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:44,960
Sure.

162
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,060
Sure. Yeah. I'm wonder about that. Right? Is is this

163
00:17:50,374 --> 00:17:58,045
is this a typical thing around the... I mean, I I remember swimming and neighbors pools when I was a kid in the eighties.

164
00:17:58,658 --> 00:17:59,158
So

165
00:17:59,615 --> 00:18:04,140
I guess I guess is not out all that far out of character. But

166
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:06,212
but, yeah, this is gonna be Donald

167
00:18:06,764 --> 00:18:20,287
big mistake. Tell us about the next bill. Yeah. I mean, actually on the next page, there's sort of an explanation where Donald says well, No there's only two of them. I should have told them to wait till next week, but there's only two. So I guess that is sort of justified.

168
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:32,260
But he gets in his film suit he comes out. And it's like dozens and dozens of kids just crammed into this pool. And it's a great flash panel by Barks. So it's even one kid

169
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:39,470
trying to drown the other. And I also find really weird that he mixes in the dog face children with, like, the pig face children.

170
00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:47,097
And like, some of them look really creepy, like the pig under the diving board. Yeah. I I feel like Bark doesn't

171
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:47,976
like

172
00:18:48,289 --> 00:19:00,968
the kids that are about that older kid age, I don't think Barks life's kids about that age. Right? Because he usually, Huey, usually represents them pretty obnoxious. It's especially in this story.

173
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:02,045
Right.

174
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:05,716
Exactly. And speaking of which one of those older kids

175
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,430
bumps donald off the side of the diving board and jumps in.

176
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,310
So Donald is screaming and screaming till the kids to get out.

177
00:19:13,845 --> 00:19:23,175
But there's no use because they can't hear a word that he's saying, which I find interesting because, like, in a lot of, like... Speaking someone who's about a lot of Dell stories

178
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:25,185
like the plot

179
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:29,370
device that most stories are hanging on is so, like, illogical

180
00:19:29,787 --> 00:19:38,121
that the whole thing is null. But like, in this situation, he really can't get the kid down. Because they can't hear him at all,

181
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:48,401
and he can't, like, individually rag them out one buy one because he's not that crazy. So what I like about this story and this page in particular is it it is very believable.

182
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:53,029
And like, I could see myself in this situation, really not being able to find a way out of it.

183
00:19:53,708 --> 00:20:00,088
Yeah. Absolutely. This is just a huge crowd of other people's kids, and if they're not gonna listen to you,

184
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:04,553
what can you do? And and, you know, this is like that baby boom one,

185
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:08,205
when neighborhoods were just overrun with children

186
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:16,260
playing outside all day, they weren't on the Internet. So, like, I... My parents talk about how kids kinda just ran wild

187
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,780
during those days. So I I think this is it's it's obviously hyper

188
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,030
exaggerated with it's believable as far as these things go.

189
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:31,296
And so we transitioned to it's just an awesome narrator box on the next page

190
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,130
hours pass hours hours.

191
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,030
Hours.

192
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:47,630
You know, Barks is just setting up how, like, desperate donald fields, and and he he... All he can do is wait until the kids eventually leave at night, one

193
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:57,549
saying, thanks for telling me about this pool butch and he says thank Josie. She told Pug and pledge told me Well, I love that name that random p.

194
00:20:58,564 --> 00:21:04,607
And and we get this neat Al little bit of missed action where Donald finally gets into his June moon lagoon

195
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,171
at night and we see some splash around, but it turns out that it's just him

196
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:22,566
clearing out the the d tried and Al litter that have been left behind by the kids swimming all day, and he's had to like, mostly drain the pool and get... He eventually gets it scrubbed and filled up by midnight.

197
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:23,880
And...

198
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:24,760
He

199
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,680
mh. Tends to wake up early in the morning to get a swim

200
00:21:30,353 --> 00:21:45,660
and references that he didn't sleep at all thinking about the pool. And he he pulls himself out of bed, really tired preparing to do a nice jack knife dive. And when he gets outside, he sees this joker or who has led his, like,

201
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,980
four big span dogs.

202
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:56,435
Paddle around in the pool saying that I he was taking them for a lock when they spied you pool. Those dogs sure love water.

203
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:05,923
Which isn't exactly preventing him from getting in. And... But I guess it is like a sanitary thing. Like, I probably wouldn't be in wanna be in pool a bunch of.

204
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,664
It's pretty... It's pretty gross. It's a great panel of these delighted dogs

205
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,196
paddle around.

206
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:22,220
Yeah. My Barks was just so great like, just funny drawing. Just very simple, just goofy stuff. Like, even that guy in the background looks kinda funny.

207
00:22:22,754 --> 00:22:30,020
Usually, like in the Barks stories, this is just dawning on me. Like, there's a very specific reason for the punishment that he gets

208
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:36,006
Like you want yet that's like deserving of this absolute torture

209
00:22:36,424 --> 00:22:37,661
that he has to go through.

210
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:45,046
Yeah. You're right. This is this is a different story. This is not one of those where he's gonna get any, like, real poetic justice

211
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:50,486
This is just one of those occasional stories Barks does where it's kind of the universe

212
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,050
the universe against Donald. And things just go wrong.

213
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:59,145
Which is awesome because it's just hilarious and it is.

214
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:02,125
So, anyway, Donald is

215
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,296
All I the manuals,

216
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:07,224
and he's walking off and he's counting up to ten.

217
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:11,371
And then all the kids come back and they rush in with the dogs.

218
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:18,064
So then Donald takes the count more and more and it comes new, and he's up counting to ten thousand

219
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:41,981
three hundred and ninety seven. And it's only till evening where he's counting to twenty thousand six hundred and three when p and Joe and all the kids are running out of the pool. That Donald has to... Has to clean it up again, so he builds up a gate and he keeps the dogs out, Keeps the kids down. And he comes up with this great idea to frees them out, which is so donald.

220
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:44,311
Like, that's just so Huey,.

221
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:51,349
Now at this point, he did does sort deserve anything he's getting to feet really one stuff frees out like a bunch of kids.

222
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:55,778
I I mean, I I still think like this is...

223
00:23:56,197 --> 00:23:57,136
Is it justified

224
00:23:57,555 --> 00:24:03,243
maybe not? But like, it a man can put ice in his own pool if you wants. You know, like,

225
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:07,975
I don't know. I guess there's some argument that it's Al attract nuisance But

226
00:24:08,672 --> 00:24:14,574
but, yeah, it's it's that panel where he has the brain's form Al great. I've got it I'll freeze out.

227
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:22,726
And so on to the next page, you know, he orders up an ice company to dump a truckload load of ice

228
00:24:23,183 --> 00:24:24,919
in the swimming pool immediately.

229
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:28,190
And in the morning, he's greeted by the sounds

230
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:29,147
of

231
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,438
presumably all of the kids the neighborhood.

232
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,113
Saying y ouch. I'm freezing

233
00:24:35,452 --> 00:24:38,405
bur. Let me out of here. And any kind

234
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:50,171
struts his way out. And this is such a great joke. The only way to really present it is just to read out what Donald says you he thinks himself. It just takes a few brains

235
00:24:50,707 --> 00:24:56,005
to figure out ways and means as he prepares to take that he says

236
00:24:57,225 --> 00:25:10,660
He says, he he thinks to himself, they're gone. And now as if fits the gentleman of leisure, I'll take my dip And as he jumps off the diving board, he thinks. It just takes a few brains to figure out ways and means,

237
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,232
And of course, he lands directly into the chill pool

238
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:18,708
with these giant Barks of ice and and

239
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:21,125
yells to himself brains,

240
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,260
where was I when those things were handed out? As he's completely forgotten about the ice,

241
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,860
that that drove the neighborhood kids out.

242
00:25:30,515 --> 00:25:43,443
Yeah. I mean, he's not wrong because you really have to be stupid if you purposely put that ice in, and you jump right back in, you totally forget about it. Go ahead. You just trade this as the next page?

243
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:50,146
Sure. So Donald is sort of back to that, like grumpy old man vibe on the next panel,

244
00:25:50,523 --> 00:26:03,202
where he's going down and town to get a book on pest control. And all the kids in the town's spot them and they start booing him, trying to spoil our fun. Who he think he is? So they all... One kid goes a tomato,

245
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:08,095
and all the other kids get the same idea to do the same thing and they all chase out of town.

246
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,723
And so Donald comes home slashing,

247
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:29,655
covered in tomatoes and everything he says himself I'm sure popular with every kid in town. But I'm gonna get at least once women my pool if I have to fight a war. Though he literally hasn't gotten a swim yet other than his like, five seconds in his pros pool. I like that one of the kids is named Bradley.

248
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:33,145
That is a good name. That's very Barks.

249
00:26:33,645 --> 00:26:42,285
And and so our our last sort of upping the steaks of what can go wrong is is gonna be a sequence with the mothers of the children.

250
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,840
We transitioned

251
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,560
to one of the moms

252
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:51,595
complaining that her little h attendance is un burned to a those. From swimming and Donald pool.

253
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:53,695
A little kid

254
00:26:53,995 --> 00:27:03,345
looks so funny to me. Austin. She's she's standing in the classic sun burn clothes where you don't wanna, like, move, you know, you keep your body rigid.

255
00:27:04,044 --> 00:27:11,135
And she just looks... She just looks so goofy. It's so funny. It is funny. She's got, like, three teeth hanging out.

256
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:13,735
And like, all her proportions are, like,

257
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:16,075
shrunk to the extreme

258
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,370
Right. And and all of the moms look really unpleasant

259
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,850
very like

260
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:27,585
p and they're all going around complaining about how various kids,

261
00:27:28,405 --> 00:27:29,385
you know, one of

262
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:35,030
another skin is me on the diving board, and they're working themselves up into a ladder

263
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:35,987
to

264
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:38,235
call on Donald Duck

265
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:42,206
where they're going to threaten him. They wanna inspect his pool.

266
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:50,510
They they wanna make sure he's got a lifeguard to protect they're a little darling unless they have him tired and feather.

267
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,490
That's a pretty great threat to make to Inducks. Right?

268
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:56,450
Classic.

269
00:27:57,265 --> 00:27:57,765
And

270
00:27:59,462 --> 00:28:01,060
and, yeah, take take us home.

271
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:05,970
Barks so calls... Donald all worried because now he's gone

272
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:14,980
everyone in the neighborhood had mad at him. So he figure he's just gonna stand up for himself, I'll just go out there and swim and dare him to get tough with me.

273
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:22,686
These screams dang way, I'm gonna do a jack knife dive, and he gets out in the diamond one. This might be the best moment in the story.

274
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:27,430
All the mothers that have come out to yell at him are now in the pool

275
00:28:27,927 --> 00:28:30,640
waiting with their feet lifting up their little dresses.

276
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:38,585
And one of them yells out drain out more water gertrude, it's still too deep for waiting, which is just awesome. And donald pose.

277
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,940
He's like skid to a stop at the end of the board just like this

278
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,420
jaw drop, which is awesome.

279
00:28:46,735 --> 00:28:50,955
So anyway, days pass and the boys are home from summer camp,

280
00:28:51,295 --> 00:28:54,175
and they wonder what donald doing with the garden and they show up.

281
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:58,127
And there's there is certainly a garden in the place, but it's

282
00:28:58,546 --> 00:29:04,020
inside the pool, which is that all the water drained out of it and they look in and they see it's a sunken garden.

283
00:29:04,754 --> 00:29:06,212
With tile sides.

284
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:12,638
One of the f these points out he's even got a springboard for something. The other one went out, maybe it's a stand on when he dives

285
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:14,850
die bonds a cabbage moss,

286
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:26,592
and that's it. We don't see the only again. Yeah. It's a it's an interesting closer. Right? The, like, the whole comedy of the way that he closed it is that we don't need to see Donald like,

287
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:28,369
resignation

288
00:29:28,987 --> 00:29:29,966
giving up

289
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:37,111
We just... The implication is that he literally never had a swim Inducks.

290
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:40,665
It his wonderful pool things just went. So

291
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:44,285
donald duck wrong that he completely gave up.

292
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:45,785
And

293
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:55,292
Yeah. I I love the structure of the story. I love the Nephews leaving and coming back the idea that everything that the reader just read

294
00:29:56,284 --> 00:29:57,143
is totally

295
00:29:57,961 --> 00:30:00,398
unknown to them. I find that very funny.

296
00:30:01,077 --> 00:30:02,976
Yeah. It it... It's a very

297
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:07,630
story. Like, I like the way you put it as donald against the universe.

298
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:27,310
Because, like, like I said, it He doesn't do a lot at first to deserve what he got with all the kids getting in the pool. He gets it later when he he just becomes, you know, he throws the ice in and and he has to kick them all out like that. But it's interesting in the sense that like

299
00:30:28,064 --> 00:30:33,439
Barks and star is usually perfectly structured, but, like, there's nothing that particularly

300
00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:36,695
perfectly sets the whole story up and, like,

301
00:30:37,508 --> 00:30:55,305
if you had to set it up in some way where he did something to deserve it all, it might have been more flawed just because that might've have messed up the formula but I don't know. I I do think it is still is a great story and probably one of the best ten pager. Yeah. I think this one is pretty close to perfect.

302
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:57,355
I think it's hard to top.

303
00:30:58,011 --> 00:31:01,240
You know, it's it's interesting to me that if you just, like,

304
00:31:02,276 --> 00:31:03,972
summarize this one for someone,

305
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,145
It would sound so

306
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:06,945
conventional,

307
00:31:07,285 --> 00:31:11,305
you know, Donald gets the idea to replace his garden

308
00:31:11,645 --> 00:31:13,265
with a backyard pool

309
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,638
and things go wrong.

310
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,435
It's it's

311
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:21,111
someone would just really have to take your word

312
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:25,205
that it's an all time classic because it sounds so bland.

313
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:25,865
Right.

314
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:28,245
But it is very annoying.

315
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,534
Yeah. It's it's but in its presentation, it's so lively

316
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:39,985
and so fast paced a lot of these stories that are among his best

317
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:43,400
really have this incredibly fast paced

318
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:50,812
structure to them. I think it's... It it really gives me something to chew on, you know, as I'm like

319
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:58,085
I have Dreams of being a creative person and and writing and stuff. And and sometimes you don't have to, like, pace every

320
00:31:58,502 --> 00:31:58,901
transition.

321
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:15,765
Okay. And and and and explain every step because Barks really successfully just throws you into that sequence here. Yeah. I mean, it is just such a a masterpiece piece of the storytelling in that sense. And you're totally right in that. It's just so

322
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:21,130
simple sounding, but it's so deep at the same time. Like, I think I said it at the beginning.

323
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:28,645
Like, they're simple stories, what like, such a power to them, which, of course is Al do a lot

324
00:32:28,983 --> 00:32:34,747
because of the story, but also the art, I mean, the art is just so fantastic and the hoses

325
00:32:35,258 --> 00:32:36,436
are so powerful.

326
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:50,063
Like we said, it's like each post tells the story as much as the story tells the story, which I think really great. Yeah. Any any favorite stand out panels for you? Because there's just so many of them in this Austin.

327
00:32:50,621 --> 00:32:52,357
Yeah. I would say

328
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:57,157
Probably that whole first page has to be like a favorite...

329
00:32:57,853 --> 00:33:01,441
Course all the kids in the pool if I had to pick one would be all the kids in the pool.

330
00:33:02,174 --> 00:33:03,792
On like, the fourth page.

331
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:04,290
Yeah.

332
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:06,725
Any of the panels that, like,

333
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:11,075
span the page, the splash panels are all great in this one.

334
00:33:11,848 --> 00:33:17,852
You know, I I I totally forgot to point out too that the the two little kids that do the initial

335
00:33:18,548 --> 00:33:21,295
request. That panel is great because it shows

336
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:35,945
two more kids behind them that the reader can see the Donald clearly can. They're kinda smiling a little bit sm because it's it's clearly a little bit of a con. The neighborhood kids have sent, you know, the the two

337
00:33:36,522 --> 00:33:41,583
most innocent looking little kids to make the request and and they specs to all

338
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,178
barrel their way and.

339
00:33:43,715 --> 00:33:47,205
But yeah, you're right. All of those the first two pages

340
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:54,565
are just full of amazing reaction shots I think my favorite one is where he's handling those two sickle

341
00:33:55,103 --> 00:33:57,780
on the first page to clear weeds.

342
00:33:58,595 --> 00:34:00,175
And he's thought this just wild

343
00:34:00,475 --> 00:34:10,609
twisted friends pose. That is a great one. It's hardly to favorite. But I love them all. And that is a great one as well, though. I always love to see the old fashioned

344
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:12,301
bugs spray.

345
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:19,575
Scrooge things too. That feels very, like, classic comic and classic cartoons to me. Oh, yeah. Excellent.

346
00:34:20,035 --> 00:34:21,429
Alright. So, we've

347
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:23,185
talked about pool,

348
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:28,830
definitely our stand story here, but we've got a couple of other great ones to go over.

349
00:34:29,405 --> 00:34:32,062
So we are gonna transition next

350
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,779
to the story called

351
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:36,976
swimming sw.

352
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:42,910
This is a really interesting one to me because it's it's a kind of story that Barks doesn't

353
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:58,748
actually tell very often. This one was a pretty early story. I haven't covered a lot of these, but this was published back in August of nineteen forty six. So Barks isn't been doing it long enough to you know, definitely like hone his

354
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:08,273
craft. He he had done a number of these at this point. But the the art style still looks a little bit a little bit rough a little bit earlier

355
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:18,515
than some of the others, and he told some different stories around this time. And and in the case of this one, it's gonna be the story that features a bully

356
00:35:19,054 --> 00:35:20,952
as a very prominent character,

357
00:35:21,491 --> 00:35:24,538
which which is is interesting and interesting to

358
00:35:24,897 --> 00:35:32,910
This one is pretty well remembered. It's not like a super highly rated one, but a seven point four is good for four hundred and sixty six,

359
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:38,584
out of all forty one thousand some disney comics So that that puts it, you know, certainly

360
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:45,295
in the upper half of, like, Barks stories as far as how people rate them. So,

361
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:46,235
essentially,

362
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:48,835
this is a story that hinges

363
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:55,990
on the nephews. That this is really more of a nephews story, right, than a Donald story specifically.

364
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:05,960
It's gonna highlight Huey, dewey Louie. It's gonna differentiate them a little bit more than these types of stories usually do. And so we open on them

365
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:09,514
really despair that they can never beat their uncle.

366
00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:13,086
In swimming races, swimming competitions.

367
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:15,541
And they've basically given up

368
00:36:16,135 --> 00:36:20,250
and they have an encounter with this neighborhood bully named butch.

369
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:21,390
So

370
00:36:22,288 --> 00:36:27,516
butch is basically egg them on. This says that they need to

371
00:36:28,373 --> 00:36:31,029
they need to beat him his uncle by being

372
00:36:31,407 --> 00:36:33,463
smart. And that he could teach

373
00:36:33,882 --> 00:36:34,382
them

374
00:36:34,815 --> 00:36:36,432
how to out smart him.

375
00:36:37,169 --> 00:36:41,498
But they they understand this to me that they should cheat. And

376
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:46,773
and and Donald kind of here. He notices that they're talking

377
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,363
to him and they're so desperate.

378
00:36:49,835 --> 00:37:11,045
To get the upper hand. They they kinda let themselves get talked into it. They kind of agree. Maybe we wouldn't have to cheat very much. And so butch has what what's actually a pretty clever idea. Right. I I think it's pretty smart. And and if this was presented in another story, I think it could have been presented as just some comic mischief

379
00:37:12,225 --> 00:37:20,136
where they're essentially gonna challenge him to only be one of the nephews and a race, and they're gonna pull the old triplets switcher

380
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:24,671
where they they run relays with one of them hiding the leads.

381
00:37:25,604 --> 00:37:38,740
Instead so that they only have to swim one lap each against Donald. It's right. It's pretty clever. They're kinda dress that they they start out the store dressed very differently in a way that they usually aren't

382
00:37:39,201 --> 00:37:51,859
so that we can see them dress, you know, be to size later. And so since Donald hears that, he thinks initially he thinks he's gonna teach him Al lesson about cheating and he's going to and their hides.

383
00:37:52,678 --> 00:37:58,791
But then he talks himself so he actually says I... I'll beat them with a brass handle cad nine scales.

384
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:06,340
So we had a little corporate punishment joke in there. Those haven't aged that well, but that was, you know, totally common place in the late forties

385
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:09,740
And so he reconsider and he

386
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:11,020
he decides

387
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,520
instead to basically out smart them and out cheap them.

388
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:22,486
By making this this device that I I think is is pretty cool. What did you think about? His his device there Austin?

389
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:28,504
Yeah. It's it is pretty cool. Like this little bicycle wheel that allows him to exert no energy.

390
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:33,105
But what I found really interesting at least at this point in the story,

391
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,185
like, especially upon

392
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:37,745
reread because I had read it before

393
00:38:38,405 --> 00:38:39,665
we were gonna record

394
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,353
by a couple months. And what I find interesting is that, usually,

395
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:50,121
Donald is the one who would be cheating. Right? And he is actually as far as we can tell,

396
00:38:50,935 --> 00:38:52,895
On that first race in the opening,

397
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:59,835
playing fair square, he is winning fair square. Right. But the nephews are cheating here and then so is donald.

398
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:06,450
So there's no particular way that the story could go in the sense that no one particularly

399
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,710
deserves punishment.

400
00:39:08,364 --> 00:39:22,121
Since they're giving each other what they're getting, right? In the race, the nephews are cheating on Donald and Donald thinks, you know, he's cheating on the nephews. And so it's interesting in the ending that, of course we won't get to for a little sort of punishes

401
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:28,365
all parties in a way that's sort of unique to the Barks Canon. Yeah. I mean, I read this...

402
00:39:28,745 --> 00:39:35,606
My reading of this is a little bit sympathetic to Donald. Right? He's justified it in his own mind as he's

403
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,909
He's allowed to cheat because he's teaching them Al lesson.

404
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:47,962
Right And so I think the story is meant to be sympathetic to his cheating because he's not like trying to cheat for glory. But I I think that's a valid

405
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:55,983
too. Right. And he is taking that more parental stands. Now you mentioned it it doesn't make more sense for him to be able to cheat.

406
00:39:56,582 --> 00:40:12,281
Because he is sort of able to teach them that lesson as like their guardian figure in these stories. Yeah. And as as someone who has kids, you know, this is one of those things that drives them crazy how effortlessly if you're swimming together how however, Is parents can beat kids

407
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,640
when they're swimming

408
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:52,989
because, you know, swimming is like everything to kids keith love to swim so much. And so like, I I think it rings true how much at the beginning it it pains them that they can't out swim grown. But it's interesting to see Donald in this, like, very parent role in this story. You know, we don't we don't have to think about that very often, but he is their guardian and Huey,. He's not just their uncle. He's their parents. And then I mean, also it is a very early so like the overall. In overall Barks career. So nothing was really set in stone as far as the formula between these guys when. So it was sort of anything goes in a sense.

409
00:40:53,627 --> 00:41:06,865
Right. And I mean, I think he kind of... He followed the lead of the cartoons that showed them in comp partition Al lot, but he definitely softened it. So, you know, the rest of the... The the race itself kinda goes the way you

410
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:11,465
expect it too. Right? They've made a wage that if Louis wins

411
00:41:12,645 --> 00:41:14,305
that Donald has to do dishes

412
00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:16,305
and vice versa

413
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,520
and

414
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:18,920
the kids

415
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:33,997
take off and they put their plan in place. It's very funny to see them doing the hand off a little relay baton sort of switching and donald thinking to himself snugly, which Nephew, it is each time

416
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,490
It's neat to see Donald

417
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,370
launch onto his cool little

418
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:45,144
underwater cycle thing, which we know that that like would be totally impractical.

419
00:41:46,362 --> 00:41:55,550
As a kid, I was totally sold. I was like, wow. That's so cool. I'm I'm sure if that would work. And and so because Donald has this like

420
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,990
device, he never gets tired

421
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,510
and the if

422
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:04,278
eventually have to give up and and the bully catches them in the next day

423
00:42:05,015 --> 00:42:06,809
with dish water hands,

424
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:16,459
which I found interesting because, like, that was not something I Severino heard of before. Yeah. I think in in the days of everyone having a dishwasher,

425
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:18,335
you know, that's not a cli

426
00:42:18,793 --> 00:42:26,945
anymore. But I guess if you had to spend an hour scrubbing dishes, that was always the punishment. Right? Back in these stories is washing dishes.

427
00:42:27,286 --> 00:42:29,085
That was the medium tour everyone had.

428
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:39,735
Right. And it it's interesting to think about, like, how that would show on the hands. But I guess this would have made sense to people, you know, seventy five years ago. Yeah. Absolutely.

429
00:42:40,755 --> 00:42:51,190
So so Butch tells them, you know, their problem is they weren't mean enough. And because they've already suffered this in. They're allowed. They allow themselves to be taught

430
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,070
into...

431
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:55,390
Setting up a new race that's gonna be even

432
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:56,470
dirtier.

433
00:42:56,985 --> 00:43:00,895
Than the first one. And Donald not around over here. There are plans.

434
00:43:01,573 --> 00:43:02,073
So

435
00:43:02,531 --> 00:43:07,278
when they launch into that race, he thinks that they've already learned their lesson.

436
00:43:08,016 --> 00:43:11,153
And as they leap off the diving board, Donald

437
00:43:11,811 --> 00:43:15,283
finds that it's quoted with glue and the nephews,

438
00:43:15,622 --> 00:43:17,699
you know, point out, Hey, you can't prove it,

439
00:43:18,418 --> 00:43:20,516
which was which is very devilish.

440
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:30,036
Like, even for them, like, of course, they're willing to cheat as they have. But, like, the... It seems very nephew to be that

441
00:43:30,614 --> 00:43:32,431
outright and like, evil

442
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:42,787
right off the bat without even trying to give him a fair chance. Yeah. Then there's definitely some like Barks needs the nephews to be more vis mischievous.

443
00:43:43,805 --> 00:43:47,502
Sometimes. This is like one of the farthest on that end of the spectrum.

444
00:43:48,135 --> 00:43:53,594
That he's ever had them get. Right? Like, there there will be times where they're really brat. Right.

445
00:43:54,391 --> 00:44:01,246
And and so their next phase is that they un deferral a net for him to get caught in,

446
00:44:01,783 --> 00:44:05,553
which struck me down this latest reread as pretty dangerous.

447
00:44:06,305 --> 00:44:09,159
Right. I mean, I I thought a lot of this, like

448
00:44:09,496 --> 00:44:13,566
especially just swimming in like this random river. I also thought was kind of dangerous.

449
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:18,760
But it was a different time, I guess, people just think about, like, things like that very seriously.

450
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:19,477
Right,

451
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:20,615
especially.

452
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:22,703
When your river

453
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:23,939
has a random

454
00:44:24,635 --> 00:44:26,531
world robust strap of a whirlpool.

455
00:44:27,387 --> 00:44:30,998
This is one of those cartoon things. You know, I I know that

456
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:33,804
reading comments and watching cartoons

457
00:44:34,301 --> 00:44:37,792
gave me the impression that whirlpool were much more common

458
00:44:38,249 --> 00:44:39,486
than they really are.

459
00:44:40,642 --> 00:44:47,457
Right. And I do wanna make a note that, like, when I was reading, I almost thought that they're this ending

460
00:44:47,914 --> 00:44:50,307
like, if you think about it doesn't really fit,

461
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:51,660
because

462
00:44:52,438 --> 00:44:57,586
each each party the nephews and on have cheated on each other and it feels like

463
00:44:58,085 --> 00:45:00,423
This sort of punishes both of them

464
00:45:00,842 --> 00:45:20,547
unfairly in the sense that like the nephews don't really deserve that and the whirlpool pool of course is a major cli just to show up on the second to last page anyways. Yeah. I mean, I think I think it's fitting just because, you know, in the cartoon lodge for these stories, we know that they're gonna be rescued

465
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:26,164
They you're alright. It does seem like a pretty big sort of poetic punishment for cheating.

466
00:45:27,401 --> 00:45:27,901
Right

467
00:45:28,278 --> 00:45:38,368
But, yeah. The the nephews get swept into this whirlpool pool. It's it's a pretty frightening sequence. Right? Because it looks very scary

468
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:43,301
They're caught up, donald has this real look of alarm on his face he's

469
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:49,843
stuck in that net and and can only bust out of it once it gets caught on a snag.

470
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:58,901
They make a reference to no one knows where the water, you know, where the whirlpool comes out And as the story ends, the nephews

471
00:46:00,281 --> 00:46:00,781
get,

472
00:46:01,361 --> 00:46:02,521
you know, pulled down,

473
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:07,071
deep into the whirlpool pool. One of them is saying this is what we get for cheating.

474
00:46:07,529 --> 00:46:13,557
And and just in the of time, they've got their uncle there, just really heroic

475
00:46:14,455 --> 00:46:18,011
str the hole in the rock that would have Ducktales them down.

476
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:38,960
And which is interesting because, like, we were talking up, like, Donald is never this heroic and any story that I could think of by Barks, you know? Like he never takes this role. Yeah. It's true. He almost never lets him be like a genuine hero. And he... And he almost never lets him get any real triumph without doing something to deflate him

477
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:39,838
immediately

478
00:46:40,415 --> 00:46:45,721
afterwards. I guess, in this case, you know, something is deflate him right beforehand.

479
00:46:46,301 --> 00:46:48,561
But... But, yeah, it it is un

480
00:46:50,301 --> 00:47:02,223
of Donald. I liked this. I like seeing Donald be like a genuine protector. I you know, the other time that comes to mind is is that other summer story vacation time when when donald is.

481
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:10,493
Make a priority. That one is just an all time class. So So there's some great hero.

482
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:16,161
I yeah some great hero in vacation time to. Another somerset

483
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:17,438
story. And

484
00:47:18,431 --> 00:47:25,031
And and it's nice. I don't need to see Donald act like this all the time, but it's nice to see him like that every once in a while. Definitely.

485
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:28,536
So the story ends with the nephews

486
00:47:29,233 --> 00:47:29,733
basically

487
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:41,033
profess that they're Severino gonna cheat again and in fact, that they'll be so good they won't even fight, and then they they correct themselves as they see butch and his gang

488
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:41,990
and

489
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:47,588
say that it's it's a little early for that. Promise and and they just weigh

490
00:47:48,005 --> 00:47:49,121
on those kids.

491
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:55,099
In a way that's kind of not typical. Right? Like, because there that's a real fist find there.

492
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:58,846
Right. And each one of the kids that they're pursuing has

493
00:47:59,263 --> 00:47:59,763
massive

494
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:02,155
sweat and tears, like

495
00:48:02,492 --> 00:48:02,965
so

496
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:15,754
speeding off of their forehead, which I find so creepy. Like this is a weird last panel. But it is a funny one. It is. And and Donald is saying docs will Inducks and the old boys will be boys

497
00:48:16,212 --> 00:48:28,946
saw, which is an expression that has aged very well. But, you know, poetic this, this ending does fit. It's nice to see them stand up to the bully. Right. So what do you think overall, I think I think this a pretty fun story.

498
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,579
It's a good one.

499
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,135
I thought the highlight was probably the climax

500
00:48:34,554 --> 00:48:39,623
because, like, I know in the addition, we're probably both reading, which is the glad stone,

501
00:48:40,638 --> 00:48:51,492
like the shading, especially really helps on, like, the blackness of the depth of the Whirlpool pool. Mh. Also, so Barks was generally just pretty good at rising stakes and stuff. Yeah.

502
00:48:52,688 --> 00:48:54,281
Beyond that, though, I thought it was fine.

503
00:48:54,695 --> 00:49:03,346
Probably won't revisit it until maybe next summer. Or like that. But it was it was pretty good for what it was, obviously. Yeah. So that was

504
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:04,600
swimming

505
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,400
sw.

506
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:17,455
I I I took bleed on that one, and we're gonna have you take the lead on our last story here. Austin. Sure. K. I have a quick question. Does this guy have a name this neighbor? Yeah. It's that interesting. He's

507
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:49,397
it's not Jones. Right? Just a generic random neighbor Yeah. This is a... This isn't neighbor Jones. Just some random neighbor who actually does have a really cool if basic, you know, dog classic dog face design with big old wrinkles, and he's towing a corn cob pipe and He's just kinda talking with Donald about it's summer, and this guy seems very, like, sad and down and He... It... It's reflected in the conversation because all he can talk about is how the nephews are gonna keep donald worried,

508
00:49:50,274 --> 00:49:53,026
trespassing on properties, swimming and dangerous places,

509
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,895
you know, sounds like a party to be around this guy.

510
00:49:56,713 --> 00:50:02,140
But Donald says he's come up with at least a very confident look on his face, very well drawn by Barks.

511
00:50:02,715 --> 00:50:10,168
He's very confident that he's got a list of everything the kids could get themselves into, and he's gonna take them to a spot

512
00:50:10,866 --> 00:50:11,745
outside of town,

513
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:16,171
where the... In ten miles out in Lake erie on a Sand,

514
00:50:16,629 --> 00:50:31,340
where they can't get into any trouble at all. And the neighbor just can't believe it. He says well you know what? If you can keep them on of mesh shift, I'll buy you at Turkey dinner. And Donald says he'll buy the neighbor Turkey dinner if the kids don't spend the quiet safest

515
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:38,140
good summer vacation of their lives, which is... This is a very interesting setup. Right? Because

516
00:50:38,814 --> 00:50:53,181
The nephews are already established and we haven't even seen them yet. As, like, just mis makers and, like, they havoc everywhere they go, which is very reminiscent of the cartoons and not the comics the Barks did. Hold on.

517
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:58,171
So it's interesting that he took this stance with that story in particular

518
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:11,421
two interesting results as we'll see. Yeah. I and you know, I think this one goes really well with pool Barks not just because of the summer thing, but both of these stories the sub text is like, what do we do with our kids.

519
00:51:11,995 --> 00:51:27,246
Because, like, this is the early fifties. Both of these were at the outside of the fifties. This this is the baby boom when there were like, so many more kids, all of a sudden being born. That neighborhoods had to, like, think about this, and I think there was more of this

520
00:51:27,743 --> 00:51:36,770
preoccupation with, like, kind of kids running wild. And what do we do with the kids and, like, just with the notion of children having more of a child

521
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:52,085
Right. And, of course, it was just a crazy different time where kids could just, you know, go out in the morning and then people would yell out the door and they would come home for dinner and everything. So, I mean, obviously, that's sort of still here in this story where they're out on the sand Barks,

522
00:51:52,205 --> 00:51:55,765
and Donald says there's total freedom you can go fishing, you can go swimming.

523
00:51:56,299 --> 00:51:57,198
Still very confident.

524
00:51:57,536 --> 00:52:17,171
He's figured it all out Right. And and nephews are very excited. They go. You know, they try to decide if they can swim swim or efficient and they get into a little bit of a fight, but Donald tells them, you know, remember, I'm here and I can watch you kids every minute. So that it got to be common and peaceful with each other, which is interesting, and he's standing there with a very

525
00:52:17,508 --> 00:52:23,766
nicely drawn men pose on the side. And And that's a strap. That's like one of those

526
00:52:24,422 --> 00:52:35,753
isn't that like just specifically for corporate pro punishment? Oh, wow. You might be right. I think that's what that is. You know what also just occurred to me. Is that this is like a

527
00:52:36,092 --> 00:52:37,071
somewhat local

528
00:52:37,464 --> 00:52:45,229
So so I'm in Pitt pittsburgh and, you know, it's driving distance from Lake Erie. I mean, it's a bit of a drive. But

529
00:52:45,606 --> 00:52:54,775
have you been... Have you ever been to lake Austin? Yeah. I think it was there once or twice. It is kind of a cool place and it is nice to have Barks give this sort of

530
00:52:55,115 --> 00:53:00,515
sense of location in this story where it's... Otherwise usually just in, like, sub suburban or whatever else.

531
00:53:01,089 --> 00:53:02,906
So the nephews are...

532
00:53:03,484 --> 00:53:09,411
That we have a nice narrator box the problem is settled peacefully and the boys go fishing. And donald is

533
00:53:09,845 --> 00:53:18,185
very happy. He gets to relax and a very nice looking hammock. He turns on the radio and this is a very odd line with, like, some gibberish

534
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:22,380
football player name that I can't even I don't even wanna try to read it.

535
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:52,869
It's a it's a parity of, like, It's supposed to be an Uber polish name. Oh, okay. It's so we're supposed to, like think. I don't know if it was p a that that there were a lot of polish players at the time. But as far as I can tell, that's supposed to be an over the top. And then the other players is like generically Italian name. Right. That one, for sure. So anyway, the nephews are over fishing and all they can get is a little fish. And they figure well they can

536
00:53:53,207 --> 00:54:28,790
make them grow if they put them in water. So they just put them in this barrel. That's full of water. Don't really think about it. They Gottfredson they jump in the water, which they realized Donald mentioned was very shallow is really too shallow to even swim and they'd all just come out. Covered and mud. And they talk about making a dining hole, which is interesting. I never heard of this where you shovel out a hole in the water that so it's deeper you can dive into, which is... I guess just the thing of the time. I mean, when people used to go swimming just didn't wherever they could in Lakes in Rivers stuff. Sure. And kids love digging. Right. So they go in and they

537
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:38,161
cut the top off of a gasoline can as one of the nephews suggest to make a good sand Scrooge they're making some good progress and Donald is thirsty.

538
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:45,521
He's listening to some more baseball with names and He goes over to the barrel and he notices the fit,

539
00:54:46,138 --> 00:55:46,065
which is sort of just sitting there. Right? And we've gone this far in the story. We're at the end of the fifth page and, like, and not much has really happened. Right? Just to draw that cartoon comparison, like, there would be a lot of times in the cartoons where they would just be a lot of, like nonsense for the first half with no real deep character moments. This is this is a fairly placid one until it until it picks up, definitely not a character piece. So the nephews come out and they see Donald and shot to the fish, and they ask what what's wrong with the fish being there and goes well it's our drinking water. So they're like, fine you clean everything and Don goes clean my, he could be covered with millions of germs, which is interesting because you would think the Nephews would have caught that. Right? They're kind of like the more logical ones. But anyway, they... Donald has to boil the water before he do drink it. So he goes to light the stove, and there's no gas. So he throws out the match and the window. And this is very typical of Barks where the staging.

540
00:55:46,483 --> 00:55:58,301
When I was reread this story, I didn't remember how it went. And even just by looking at this panel where he's throwing the match out the window, The window is isolated on the left and Donald is walking off on the right.

541
00:55:58,914 --> 00:56:40,985
So it's like four foreshadowing like something's gonna happen by drawing specific attention to the window on its own where you can clearly make out the match lit is thrown over. Yeah. That's a really good point. You're if you're right on with that, like, pacing and and the signaling that he does there. Which is cool, I mean, of course, it speaks levels about Barks art and how it mesh so well with this storytelling. But anyway, he goes to look for the gas, and the nephews, of course, used it for a scoop. So they ported it all out over the side of the boat and Donna realize and he just realized he also threw a lit match out the window, and we get a very cool splash panel of the boat and the water around it being on fire.

542
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,580
Austin, how about his beak when he realizes...

543
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:51,551
Yeah. That's almost I at a one eighty angle. It's yeah. So that is crazy. It's great. Yeah. But

544
00:56:51,889 --> 00:57:01,367
typical Donald is sort of just screaming whatever he can screen, get the motor started. Pull up the anchor, grab or gotta get away from here. Hurry up marie. The boats catching a fire.

545
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:07,880
So they get some water and they're clear the blaze, they're pulling out and Donald still angry though.

546
00:57:08,813 --> 00:57:21,417
Nephews wonder why, and it's well they have no drinking water. They've got no gas to used but boil the water, and there's no gas to take to shore to get more gas. Right because he's had to pour that water barrel

547
00:57:21,756 --> 00:57:31,376
out He can't even boil that water now. They've had to extinguished that little bit of sm though. Exactly. Which is this is very very cleverly

548
00:57:31,874 --> 00:57:36,020
conceived. I mean, even with this story, which is just comparatively

549
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:46,435
weaker and not not necessarily weak we're just not as deep as Barks as other stories, like, This is pretty smart how they get themselves into this, like, believable

550
00:57:46,775 --> 00:57:52,330
predicament again, going back to pool Barks where like really couldn't be able to pull out individually.

551
00:57:52,710 --> 00:58:00,943
Those dozens and dozens of kids just populating your pool. Right. And I I would say this one's kind of just like solidly average,

552
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:03,418
maybe even slightly above average

553
00:58:03,876 --> 00:58:05,534
and my book did I mention

554
00:58:05,872 --> 00:58:14,805
this... The rating for this one? Left it out. Didn't I think Yeah. I do think you left to. That's fine. But I'll just mention here really quick. It was published

555
00:58:15,342 --> 00:58:29,910
Walt disney Comm storage one forty two and July of nineteen fifty. Two, and it's a seven point three on Inducks induction but for six hundred and two. So, like I think I think if you looked at the median rating

556
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:37,099
for a Barks story, it would be either a seven point one or a seven point two I end. It's kinda where most of them are.

557
00:58:37,658 --> 00:58:39,333
That's that's good. You know, it's fine.

558
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,143
Right Exactly. And also, like, a couple people,

559
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,036
men are on Inducks

560
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:48,746
voting things to the bottom, like the masterpiece

561
00:58:50,164 --> 00:58:50,664
post.

562
00:58:52,002 --> 00:58:54,595
A hot take there. Yeah. Well, not

563
00:58:55,255 --> 00:59:02,988
not a masterpiece piece, but a really cool story. If I... Do I need to... Do I need to put you down for that one a couple of years in advance.

564
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:05,646
Yeah. Sure. I can advocate that's

565
00:59:06,105 --> 00:59:39,897
twenty twenty seven. Correct. So anyway, Donald is going classic donald is going crazy while the Nephews user totally calm with whatever. So he goes to the drinking barrel and he figures you know what, even if there was a dirty term covered fish I've just got to have a drink. And he's trying to reach in and he totally slips in the barrel And I guess she supposed to see me he's just knocked down there. You know, you've got the classic car too star over the head you hear the thud and on a on of Pee Barks with the gl. Right. Mouth. And then after are around the corner, they're doing a little inspection.

566
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:48,542
You know, it's kind of our fault that things are in a mess. Maybe we should do something to help him out. And this I thought was, like, very cartoon Nephew

567
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:49,355
because

568
00:59:49,694 --> 00:59:56,396
they do a lot of things. And just generic like, you know, pesky nephew niece, arch type,

569
00:59:56,889 --> 00:59:59,640
where they do something that they think is very intelligent.

570
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,152
Very smart move one, it isn't. Right.

571
01:00:03,149 --> 01:00:17,280
Which I thought was very weird for Barks because I don't know and he ever did something like that with the nephews in another story. I'm sure there's a few, but you're alright. He he he definitely dumps them down a bit for this one. Right. So they figure it's it's a great idea to

572
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:21,000
throw Al Sos in the barrel, which they somehow

573
01:00:21,555 --> 01:00:26,628
throw in without noticing their uncle, you know, passed out unconscious at the bottom,

574
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:41,226
and they're also able to lift it over the side of the boat and throw it in. Thinking on will be mighty pleased when he finds out what we've done. Right. They go around and they try to find him. They realized these actually disappeared from the boat entirely. And,

575
01:00:41,764 --> 01:00:46,789
yeah. I mean, it's all very convenient. I do like the way in the story. Kind of everything.

576
01:00:47,326 --> 01:00:51,816
This is this is a typo pathology of story that bark really lights. Things

577
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:59,892
escalate through these like you know, it's just the sequence of one one bad event after another. Right. But anyway, we go to Donald,

578
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:12,505
and he's in the water, and I just notices since you were talking, but these talking gibberish actually one of the things that he says like the random symbols Barks puts is a salon

579
01:01:12,885 --> 01:01:15,185
if you can make that out, which I thought was

580
01:01:15,485 --> 01:01:17,705
super random. I think.

581
01:01:18,045 --> 01:01:24,145
Yeah. This that is interesting thing. I think it's a man or might mind you. So the

582
01:01:24,562 --> 01:01:25,501
the sw

583
01:01:26,197 --> 01:01:27,215
and the me

584
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:30,914
are kind of opposed to each other. Oh,

585
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:33,007
like sort of mirror

586
01:01:33,344 --> 01:01:34,601
images, the reason.

587
01:01:34,937 --> 01:01:37,766
And that's just like an old symbol

588
01:01:38,224 --> 01:01:38,724
that

589
01:01:39,142 --> 01:01:55,609
was like, commonly used before, you know, it got per by the not So I don't think that meant. I don't think it's meant to be a sw cook because I think the sw goes... Yeah. The sw goes the other way. So that's a man. Oh, interesting.

590
01:01:56,148 --> 01:01:56,428
Okay. Yeah.

591
01:01:57,786 --> 01:01:59,565
Anyway, we we've reached the end

592
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,722
not a lot happened there.

593
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:30,986
But Donald sort of just in the barrel and he's floating along, and he thinks I should pass close to a city soon. There's Buffalo and lack wan and Niagara falls. And he's just sort just floating along and just out of nowhere, he's just shooting down the bottom of niagara falls and is just screaming help with this really cool splash panel where there's a a magnifying glass over the image of the barrel just to help you put their by Barks

594
01:02:31,624 --> 01:02:40,836
sort of to looking on that. It's funny that going over in niagara falls and the barrel was a cli even at that point. Right? Because of the fisherman

595
01:02:41,376 --> 01:02:41,876
reaction.

596
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:48,651
Right. Yeah. The fish mint says don't tell me another joker gone niagara falls in barrel, which is interesting.

597
01:02:49,271 --> 01:02:51,131
Sorta to to draw the cartoon

598
01:02:51,431 --> 01:03:08,140
comment comparison we could say. Couple of years later, would Wood packer went over in Niagara fools and a barrel, and a couple years after that, Dick Kin wrote a story a comic story. With Feather Dunkin and Donald were feather, I think when over niagara falls and a barrel. Nice. Yeah.

599
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:11,421
So one week later and we're back home.

600
01:03:12,115 --> 01:03:25,081
And we have the classic bark silhouette of Donald withholding of Turkey handing it to the neighbor, and the neighbor goes all oh. So the perfect spot was a flop. Something happened to the kids, wait... I don't know what he's asking that because he should be be

601
01:03:25,817 --> 01:03:31,201
able to see that Donald is walking around in a cast and and he's got a candy he goes. Now.

602
01:03:31,615 --> 01:03:43,741
Nothing happened at the kids, but what happened to me, oh brother to close out the story. Yeah. And it's a fun ending. You know, it is definitely a little con contract because as you the neighbors should be able to see that.

603
01:03:44,281 --> 01:03:46,501
But it's well paced and it's another

604
01:03:46,921 --> 01:03:49,021
another example of the book ending

605
01:03:49,375 --> 01:04:04,354
that bark likes to do a lot. It's it's a good way to kind of get get that little comedic sting there. Right. Full circle. Perfect. Yeah. So, yeah, it's a fun. It's a fun story. I don't think it's like a master or anything.

606
01:04:05,306 --> 01:04:10,526
It's just a good solid example of a Barks ten pager that did happen to come

607
01:04:11,266 --> 01:04:14,860
in them out... I think it it compares kind of poorly

608
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:18,333
to some of the stories that it was like, published,

609
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:22,803
you know, in sequence with. Right. Like, the trouble with dimes

610
01:04:23,316 --> 01:04:28,356
was that... Yeah. That was just a couple months before. Yeah I think that was spend through.

611
01:04:29,076 --> 01:04:31,791
Unfortunately it is it's it's a well crafted,

612
01:04:32,131 --> 01:04:33,791
but it is very forget

613
01:04:34,331 --> 01:04:39,211
coming out in the year nineteen fifty two with only a plural man, obviously.

614
01:04:39,785 --> 01:04:44,268
Right. It it came out the same month as Golden helmet.

615
01:04:45,879 --> 01:04:53,179
Oh my god. Yeah. Every every... I'm just looking at the list of stories on with Pd. You know, they have them sequentially. And you're right.

616
01:04:53,517 --> 01:04:58,183
We have just a few months before we've got the screaming cowboy,

617
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:03,344
which is not one of my favorites, but I know a lot of people love and is pretty pretty invent.

618
01:05:04,221 --> 01:05:05,359
We've got statues

619
01:05:05,871 --> 01:05:10,491
spend f and Rocket wing saves the day and Gladstone terrible secret,

620
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:19,613
which is I think is Al all time as is the think box bo which was the previous story. You have the pair of beagle boys stories and knocked

621
01:05:20,429 --> 01:05:28,680
November and December of fifty one. Right? Right. Yeah. Just a few months prior. So, like, this is a good solid story there are just

622
01:05:29,376 --> 01:05:39,729
so many great stories surrounding. And A lot of them are the ones that are gonna get, you know, their own episodes are close to their own episodes of of the podcast here. So So... Yeah.

623
01:05:40,648 --> 01:05:41,627
That that was

624
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:46,836
that was fun though talking about these three stories and figuring out some of the parallels.

625
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:54,602
It's nice to be able to be seasonal with these and kick off summer with these summer themed stories. What do you think? Should people...

626
01:05:55,181 --> 01:05:59,971
I think people should check out pool shots. People should definitely check out pool Barks

627
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:05,805
if you've got other better Bark stories to go to, like Golden Helmet,

628
01:06:06,464 --> 01:06:16,521
I would not go to the other two first but they do make very interesting reading for someone who's already well educated on. How good Barks could be when he wanted to

629
01:06:17,019 --> 01:06:27,226
and how even the most average Barks stories are, like, super superb crafted. Right. There's a lot of really great stuff. And those other two stories. But

630
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:36,837
listeners go it yourself to save pool Barks because it is an all time classic. It's one of his ten page masterpieces.

631
01:06:38,135 --> 01:06:38,635
Absolutely.

632
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:48,751
And. Any closing thoughts sauce Go re pool Barks and have a good summer, I guess. Yeah. You said it. Alright. Take care of everyone. See.
