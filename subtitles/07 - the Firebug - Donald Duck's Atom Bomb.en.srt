00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:52,573
And hello, everyone. Welcome back to Bark remarks.

4
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:54,250
I'm Mark Sever.

5
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:58,460
I am still a grown man who enjoys donald dot com books.

6
00:00:59,313 --> 00:01:08,720
And I really enjoy enjoyed talking about them, and I've dragged along a couple of guest hosts that are going to put up with talking about

7
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:09,959
these comics.

8
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:13,774
Eric, why don't you introduce yourself first this time?

9
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:17,330
My and Eric, I have grown up reading all sorts of comments.

10
00:01:17,864 --> 00:01:27,376
Little bit of disney ones in the and then when I was little, Lamar speak to the fan the local Scrooge and up and dial and Barks, and I must enjoy. I have enjoyed

11
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:28,349
immensely,

12
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:33,455
what I've read so far, know it's forwarded to what he's going to show me later. Excellent.

13
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:34,910
And Ryan.

14
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:38,741
I'm Ryan Bailey. I've read the thousands of

15
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,098
Marvel comics, and

16
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:48,385
I have been reading these as Mark makes me. So now probably about half a dozen of Carl Barks comics

17
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:56,546
Yeah. And I I guess really quickly, before we launch into this episode of the stories in this episode,

18
00:01:57,363 --> 00:02:01,496
which is kind of a weird one, we're gonna be talking about two stories

19
00:02:02,527 --> 00:02:04,941
which are the fire bug

20
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:08,012
and Donald Du Adam Barks.

21
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,405
I'm gonna take a moment because you guys have

22
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,812
been on this Barks journey.

23
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:19,526
Do do you guys have, like, a favorite so far out of the the half dozen or so that we've read?

24
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,875
Ryan putting you on the spot.

25
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:23,989
I think mine would be

26
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:26,800
frozen gold. I think that's my favorite one so fun.

27
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:27,955
Excellent,

28
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:31,295
a good choice. And how about you, Eric?

29
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:33,255
I like the one with the money.

30
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,168
Alright. The money ring. Very nice.

31
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:39,793
I'm gonna say something different. I would probably

32
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:42,321
have to pick tear of the river.

33
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:46,670
Very narrowly over mystery of the swamp. So

34
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,725
that's that's where we are going into these.

35
00:02:50,779 --> 00:03:01,943
I assigned you guys these two stories again we are doing the fire bug and Donald du Adam Bomb, and we're just a few up episodes in and

36
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:07,257
we're already breaking the format rules that I established. Right? Because

37
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:12,706
I said that I wanted to make this podcast focused on the

38
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:17,634
full length Karl Barks adventure stories. They're mostly adventures. Stories.

39
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:19,832
Some of them are just much longer.

40
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,440
But there there's a couple of reasons behind why I wanted to bring these

41
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:29,010
to shorter stories in and break the format rules.

42
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:35,670
And and first off, I thought about it when I realized that I had been going by wikipedia

43
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:41,915
description of how long each story was. And when you read with Wikipedia,

44
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:51,680
If you scroll down, Donald Du Adam Barks, says that it's thirty pages long. So I identified it as our next one at the end of last episode.

45
00:03:52,373 --> 00:04:02,576
And then when I went to read it, I realized... Oh, yeah. I haven't read this one in many, many years, but this is a weird story that had an unusual format,

46
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:05,926
and it was technically printed in thirty pages,

47
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:10,530
but it was printed as part of the cheer give away.

48
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:14,925
In a format that was more like comic strips size.

49
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:16,165
And

50
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:19,245
so it it is thirty pages

51
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:23,152
Wikipedia really needs to have some kind of an asterisk next to that.

52
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,530
But

53
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:35,956
about someone should edit Al that page. Yeah. Yeah. I'll I'll get right on it. This stuff. So... But I I thought that actually, this might be a really good opportunity because

54
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:38,907
I had skipped over the fire bug,

55
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,759
which is in a kind of a weird spot for the bark stories in terms of length because that one is thirteen pages.

56
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:47,054
And

57
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:51,222
that makes it longer than the hundreds of ten pager he did.

58
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:53,957
But much shorter

59
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:58,598
then most of the others. And they happen to be...

60
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:00,592
They happen to be sequentially,

61
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:04,000
you know, very close in terms of when they were published.

62
00:05:04,414 --> 00:05:07,625
So that worked out well, the fact that they're both technically

63
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:08,742
longer

64
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,098
than ten pages.

65
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:17,096
And then they're also a good package, I think, be has they are both very unusual

66
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:21,051
kind of dark stories that have a little bit of a notorious

67
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:27,179
history. So I thought that it would be a good opportunity to kind of take them Al package

68
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:30,875
and talk about them talk about them together.

69
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:33,108
As sort of notorious

70
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:35,904
semi band Disney comics.

71
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,341
So we are gonna take on

72
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,314
the

73
00:05:39,813 --> 00:05:43,587
we're gonna take on the fire first because that one did come chronological

74
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:44,425
earlier.

75
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,789
And and and then we'll talk about Adam Bomb

76
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:52,541
And, you know, we can take a little bit of time to talk about

77
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:56,150
the two of them and kinda how they compare.

78
00:05:57,044 --> 00:05:58,103
A little bit of background.

79
00:05:58,482 --> 00:05:59,781
So the fire bug

80
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,740
is

81
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:07,346
published in January of nineteen forty six. Is this cover date? It was in four color

82
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:09,142
one hundred and eight

83
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:16,942
which actually makes it a package story with tear of the river. You know, I didn't realize that it was in the same issue.

84
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,618
This is the b story for that comment. And

85
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:25,229
this one is I already mentioned it's thirteen pages long.

86
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:27,189
It was

87
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:29,149
reprinted,

88
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:49,893
I think for the first time in nineteen sixty eight, in Donald dot one forty three, and I just find that notable because that's that time around, it got its own cover. Or. It wasn't done by Barks. But it's a fun fun cover from the, I think, the gold era. A little bit of... Well, here's the synapse for this one. So

89
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:55,166
in the fire about donald suffers blow to the head that causes him to become up.

90
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:04,659
And he sets some small, but very creative fires around the city while dodging Huey, dewey and Louie. And then he gets blamed for a series of large fires,

91
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:14,329
but he may not be the real culprit. A little bit more background trivia, this is the only one that he ever did that was this length thirteen pages

92
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:20,815
excluding a few junior wood check stories that he did very late in his career that were collaborations with others.

93
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:25,919
The the really interesting trivia about this one it has to do with the ending of the story

94
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:27,713
because this one

95
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:29,867
caused some real controversy

96
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:40,183
among the publisher, Western publishing thought the the original ending for this was too dark, and they had another artist create an alternate panel.

97
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:52,625
Basically, and it was all a dream. Panel. I also thought that it was this story contrast pretty well with another story from around this era called Fire Donald,

98
00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:01,171
I'll share this one with you guys. It's not one that we're gonna end up covering because it is a ten pager. But it's a pretty famous ten page or where he becomes a volunteer

99
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:15,408
firefighter. So We've kinda got both sides of the spectrum in this one. We're not gonna go deep into the value range because we already talked about what this was worth with a tear of the river, I'm gonna go into a little bit

100
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:16,883
of that

101
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,040
historical

102
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:19,356
background

103
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:23,701
context to that you guys know I love to do so much.

104
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,135
I I looked at what was going on in the world and this time,

105
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:38,134
and this is when we had the Un general assembly meeting for the first time in London. This this month saw the issue of the first Roosevelt dime

106
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:42,600
I am going to talk a little bit about what I read up on

107
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:45,948
regarding the history of the condition of Pi.

108
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:51,315
Oh, good. I was wondering about that one, because... Yeah. It's interesting

109
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:55,490
how these comments, obviously not based into any kind of science.

110
00:08:56,143 --> 00:08:58,096
Like to just go up with. I think this is what happens.

111
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:00,588
You hit up the head once. And

112
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,236
you go crazy about something. Yeah.

113
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,509
And and weirdly, I did see something in the literature

114
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:21,809
that kind of matched What happened to Donald in this one, but like you said, this is very very fantastic. I I did a semi deep dive on Pi. I read a feature on the American Journal site psychiatry.

115
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:25,525
Alright. So higher romania is in the American

116
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:29,260
D m five. Right, The diagnostic manual.

117
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:31,051
But it's kind of been

118
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:33,523
controversial. They've like

119
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:43,335
included it and taking it out as a a legitimate diagnosis, but but it's it's basically one as of now. It it is a real diagnosis.

120
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:46,312
There's still some vigorous debate

121
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:48,370
about whether it really exists.

122
00:09:48,784 --> 00:09:51,341
It does have incredibly low incidents.

123
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,396
And in a finished study, I got a pan to the scandinavians

124
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:56,135
listening.

125
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:59,559
In a finished study of ninety arson sn

126
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:03,343
only three of them met the criteria for true pi.

127
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:06,387
And they Scrooge that, generally,

128
00:10:07,283 --> 00:10:07,783
para

129
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,178
are predominantly male, average age is eighteen, and they set five roughly every six weeks.

130
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:18,461
And there are six very specific criteria to differentiate it.

131
00:10:19,457 --> 00:10:24,794
One, it has to be a deliberate and purpose full fire setting on more than one occasion, two,

132
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,875
there has to be tension or effective arousal before the act.

133
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:34,969
Three, there's gotta be a fascination or interest in carry or curiosity or traction to fire.

134
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:49,168
For. There's has gotta be some kind of pleasure or patient or relief when setting fires or witness them. Five, the fire setting cannot be done for monetary gain, getting revenge, a expression of, like Al ideology.

135
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:53,901
And then finally, the fire setting is not better explained by a Inducks

136
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,532
disorder. So we can kinda think about whether donald matches

137
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,370
those criteria.

138
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:03,405
And then, of course, we're not calling him a

139
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:07,739
arson in. We're calling him a fire bug, which is

140
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,926
a... I really like that nickname. For an arson for a p rather.

141
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:19,585
That... I found that it was first used in eighteen seventy, and, obviously, it means someone that's obsessed with setting fires.

142
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:23,292
Had you guys heard that term before fire?

143
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,109
Eric?

144
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:28,494
I'm gonna have to say, probably yes. But just

145
00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:50,156
and Al the many camp outs, I went as a scout as a use of the kids that always like to be in charge of the fire. It does... Oh, yeah He's a fire. He's Al fires. How about you, ryan? I think I have heard that term. Yeah. It was... It's did not str this new one I heard. But I feel like I haven't heard a long time, like, since I was a kid. Yeah. I I agree. I feel like it's kinda going out of fashion.

146
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:51,773
Were you guys

147
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:54,425
fire bugs where you guys fire centers as kids?

148
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,459
I think Al boys

149
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,339
from eleven to fourteen, or probably

150
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,311
That that is a yes then. Right. Alright. I I don't think I really was.

151
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:19,024
I knew plenty kids who were, but I know. When I was... That age, I had a healthy respect for fire. Was that really interesting starting water dealing with it. No. I used to... I used to set small fires out behind our our wooden shed.

152
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:20,814
And

153
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:23,851
close to it. Thank thank goodness handle

154
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,508
yeah. That's not anything you should be doing. Yeah.

155
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:29,285
Exactly. I think this is a really

156
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,220
fascinating

157
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,459
story. I think this one's really cool. Do you guys have any comments and any additional comments about kind of that background or

158
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:50,615
I I also looked into it. I asked my long time family doctor web m dot com about it. Yeah. It said the cost was unknown, but it's not to be there's psychiatric issues like anxiety and substance abuse addiction depression,

159
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:55,484
mood disorders, learning disabilities, They think there might be a hereditary

160
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,960
component and

161
00:12:57,297 --> 00:13:03,437
are other stress like some kind of major loss or abuse or some something like that? And it is not treated

162
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:10,551
with surgery from a random guy in the crowd at court hearing. It's actually treated with cognitive behavioral therapy.

163
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:15,539
Cognitive behavioral is is the answer to many things that

164
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:17,457
used to be treated

165
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:21,107
with a saw or a massive drug.

166
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:24,784
So yeah we're definitely gonna talk about that guy. I I

167
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:28,275
I'm Al fascinated by that doctor at the end in a way that I wasn't

168
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:29,631
as a kid.

169
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:30,446
Alright.

170
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:31,902
So

171
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:33,455
so the fire

172
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:35,500
starts off with

173
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:40,567
It's a very cold morning, and the Nephews are asking Donald

174
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:41,485
to

175
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,721
start a fire

176
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:47,690
And Donald suffers Al blow to the head on the way down the stairs.

177
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:58,486
And that that's what turns him into a fire bug. He he is kind of sc at to the need for a fire on the way down and way that four shadows.

178
00:13:58,824 --> 00:14:03,415
And then by the time he gets to the bottom after getting injured. He's got

179
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:05,375
a gl in his eye,

180
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:07,055
and he is

181
00:14:07,435 --> 00:14:09,895
fascinated by the fire in the fireplace.

182
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,390
And Donald goes outside he sets a bunch of fires in the backyard,

183
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,550
the nephews

184
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,850
and encounter him, and they're very alarmed.

185
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:24,480
Al his behavior, and they recognize very quickly that something is wrong

186
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:27,555
so they lure him into the house

187
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:32,753
and they tie him up and they go to see a doctor

188
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:40,019
The doctor that they see is doctor K fast. And that's a a name that Barks is gonna use for

189
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:41,073
Scrooge

190
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:42,888
long time

191
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,689
secretary later on down the road. So I I caught that this time.

192
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:48,966
The doctor

193
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:50,043
is

194
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:53,053
identifies him as a pi,

195
00:14:54,631 --> 00:15:00,145
says he has p of the deck. This worries, the nephews, they wanna take care of him themselves,

196
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:07,080
so they rush home, but by the time they get home, he has escaped by burning through the ropes.

197
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,315
And so they're off to find him they

198
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:13,595
they see a large fire down at the Harbor,

199
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:18,435
and they see him looking very guilty and coming back

200
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:22,925
from that direction with a can of gasoline and a box of matches.

201
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:26,721
The Nephews ambush him, they take him back home

202
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:30,695
they do some of their own age appropriate Web

203
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:32,615
research in a book

204
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:40,951
and to try and figure out how to take care of him. But by the time they get back into his room, he's burned his way out again.

205
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,065
Gone through the floor this time.

206
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:44,442
And then

207
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:48,495
the nephews split up to go and find him. Do sees

208
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,915
H camp fire down at near the railroad bridge.

209
00:15:52,489 --> 00:16:00,531
And he encounters Donald about to set a series of very, like, artistic fires including a square fire

210
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:03,755
round fire and a hollow fire.

211
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:08,939
Of course, there's three dimensions, so it's really like a cubic fire or spherical fire.

212
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:10,236
And then

213
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:15,164
as Dewey is looking on, there is a very sinister looking police officer

214
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:17,615
observing behind him. And so

215
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:25,335
dewey rush him away and the police officers noting these special fires to report them to head headquarters.

216
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:26,727
And

217
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:28,802
sure enough on the way out,

218
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:42,990
they over here a police dispatch warning about the specific fires that Donald was doing. And so Donald runs away because he doesn't wanna be locked up. Unable to start more fires. And the nephews have to recon.

219
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:43,950
They

220
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:50,685
meet Al the near the oil refineries where they see some buildings that match donald old

221
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:53,456
very elaborate fires burning,

222
00:16:53,935 --> 00:17:02,870
a square around and a hollow fire. And again, Al the scene of the crime, they see donald with a Canon of gas celine, and they also encounter

223
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:03,990
that

224
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:05,109
police officer

225
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:16,272
from the from the railroad bridge from the river. They run away from him, they hide in a lumber yard and they looked like they've gotten away, but

226
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,906
Donald can't resist burning

227
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,120
a new masterpiece.

228
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:26,360
He lights a clover fire and they have to keep running. There's just so much running in this one that the characters

229
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:38,779
even are complaining about it. And so when they finally get away at night, they're catching their breath and Donald is complaining about what what all the fuss is and the nephews are like, well, you burned down half the town.

230
00:17:39,478 --> 00:17:45,790
But Donald says, no, he doesn't like to repeat his fires. He's an artist. He invent new kinds of fires.

231
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:52,785
And to prove it, he takes them back down to the the railroad bridge where he can show his newest masterpiece

232
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:59,520
a t shaped fire. And, again, that police officer shows up with another with his partner

233
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,284
and they get the drop on the Ducktales. And

234
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:06,595
the original cop

235
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:08,308
tells his partner

236
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:09,639
to go

237
00:18:10,178 --> 00:18:14,454
to go basically get back up while he guards the docks.

238
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:21,885
But then he lets his guard down, the docks realize that they can escape and they do... Yeah more running. They take some...

239
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:26,045
They they hide in a steep, and they start to

240
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:35,385
kind of pond or what's been happening and they realized that, you know, if Donald is telling the truth, then there must be another fire bug. And they

241
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:41,625
consider that it's so weird that that cop seems to have basically let them get away. And

242
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:58,925
they surmise that he he must be the fire. And this is another example where there's kind of a bit of a mystery, and I like that they just kinda work through it really quickly. We've seen that a couple of times in the. So they they're they're working it together. They realized that

243
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:08,060
you know, Donald is this fire Al buy, so they need to look for a t shaped to building. That's gonna be the Target. And they see one by the waterfront

244
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:09,364
and
