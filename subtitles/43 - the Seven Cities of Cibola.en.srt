Thank you, Mark. Yeah. We're in Harmon here

8
00:01:08,812 --> 00:01:16,390
back for another great podcast and reviewing a story that I grew up with. I I'm a long time Barks collector comma collector all

9
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:22,450
mostly, and got into the lit graphs later in life and all around Ducktales.

10
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,910
So love the podcast and love sharing my my

11
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,510
and story thoughts. Excellent.

12
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:34,027
Warren, have you ever hung out in the American Southwest

13
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:36,715
before? Well, yeah. You know, when I was working,

14
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:55,150
actively with Mayo Clinic here in Rochester. We have Al clinic in Scottsdale in Phoenix, So I would go to Phoenix and Scottsdale two or three times a year. For many years, and I... On one of my adventures there. I I traveled the state, you know went up to Northern Arizona went down to Southern Arizona really enjoyed the the landscape

15
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,790
and the desert and

16
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,910
this brought back a few of those memories.

17
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:07,036
Oh, that's excellent. Yeah. So we we are going to journey to the to the Southwest. I guess I should say return

18
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:09,786
to the Southwest for this episode.

19
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:12,296
Because because Barks really likes

20
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:15,140
setting his stories in this area.

21
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:18,566
And I'm happy to hear that you're pretty experienced

22
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:22,335
with the that that area with the the the Southwestern

23
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:26,215
Desert, it's a beautiful place and it really figures

24
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:31,999
strongly and in this story, which which is, of course, the seven cities of.

25
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:35,670
Yes. Also known as the seven cities of gold,

26
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:39,534
in a lot of reprint. I know we'll talk a little bit about that, but

27
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:59,320
I was fascinated with this story at ten years old when I bought my very first gold key comic. I think guy told you this at our very first podcast that was the best of and donald dot number two, which feature to featured luck of the North my favorite story, but look at the secondary there, the secondary was is right. That's.

28
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:07,116
That's where I discovered this story for the first time Al a ten year old and nineteen sixty seven. And absolutely

29
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:26,928
was a maze at the sheer adventure and vast of it. So really, I'm looking forward to share my memories as I gonna revisit this story. That's a great, like, pairing of stories to be introduced to the to the Barks universe. Right? Because you get these two great stories two very different adventures,

30
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,001
very different settings

31
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:32,795
you get good exposure to Donald Scrooge Gladstone,

32
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:46,780
That... That's that's an awesome comic to have started. Yeah. It's my favorite, actually. One of my favorites? I can understand why. So I have a lot of experience with this area too because I I spent about I spent almost fifteen years.

33
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,015
In the desert. I I lived outside of Phoenix

34
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:52,935
for much of my life and so

35
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:55,750
it figures really strongly in my

36
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,104
imagination and and memories.

37
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,260
And

38
00:03:59,678 --> 00:04:05,721
and and I think Barks just really enjoyed depicting this area. You know, he grew up in

39
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:19,461
the inland part of California. Right? And the that's where we're we're gonna kick off in this story and and and they're they're actually... I can travel a a pretty pretty long way through some pretty

40
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:20,377
unforgiving,

41
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:28,891
but really think wonderfully drawn American Southwest Desert. That's what struck me was the artwork and the incredible...

42
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:35,455
Just his depiction of what his memories were of that area. And his love of of the native cultures

43
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:38,132
comes through in this story so well. And

44
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:54,706
and respectfully as well. Yeah. I think you're right. You know, he he's definitely Barks shows a lot of interest in the the lower and the history of the region that he's in. You can see that he really likes to focus on and stories like in old, California,

45
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:59,550
and in this one. And and so you you see a lot of personal touches

46
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:09,584
in this story references to some actual place names is gonna sneak in a little cameo if someone he knows Eleven. It it it it makes for a really

47
00:05:10,162 --> 00:05:10,662
absorbing

48
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:29,602
story. My kind of initial thoughts on this one warren. Right? We're we're in... We're at uncle Scrooge numbers. Seven, and and this was this came out in July of nineteen fifty four was the publication date. And and so we're we're still very pretty early in the uncle Scrooge

49
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:35,055
series. And one of the things that doing this podcast has, like, kinda crystal

50
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:44,061
for me is I I never really thought about the sequence of stories that he did, you know? And to me, it seems like he spent the first handful

51
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:46,712
of the uncle screwed stories,

52
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:47,551
really

53
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,009
concerned with kind of like,

54
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:51,386
establishing the character

55
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:53,398
softening

56
00:05:53,736 --> 00:06:06,948
some of the kind of light negative edges that he had given him when he was kind of a side care. Right. Now now I you you gotta imagine that he's proud of of getting a flagship

57
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:07,787
title

58
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:15,920
like an act shaw comment but with feature his creation. Right? So can he really threw a lot into

59
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:28,633
creating uncle Scrooge and establishing him in number one, only a plural man, number two, back to the dyke to a lesser extent, but still concerned with some of that making of Scrooge

60
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:32,566
number three as well. And then gets further

61
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:38,891
into this series and, like, starting with issue number four of the series

62
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:45,337
and into the rest of it. We're more in this mold of just kind of having these adventures.

63
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:51,404
And this one's a pretty big deal in a certain way because, like it's it's really his first

64
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:52,362
official

65
00:06:53,235 --> 00:07:11,910
treasure heinz. It is. And and I liked what you said about the evolution of his character development in his own series what what I think is wonderful is as a young reader back in the fifties you're seeing this old man duck if you will. Who's this multi billion billionaire

66
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:18,220
and and yet he's not afraid of anything. He'll do anything. He'll travel be a treasure hunter, he'll go

67
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,780
everywhere with his nephews and I think he just established this wonderful

68
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,700
character

69
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,960
in in Scrooge

70
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:33,730
who... Like you said, in this story goes on his very first treasure hunt Right. And and this is what the character is really gonna be

71
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:38,650
remembered for. Kind of interesting that it's taken like, so many issues.

72
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:43,515
Right? Because most of the previous, like, quote adventures have been

73
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:46,043
about protect as fortune.

74
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:53,718
They've even been these really deep character studies. Yeah. Right? Concerned, like especially uncle Scrooge

75
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:59,270
one two and three, as well as number six. T,

76
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,430
are are these really, like

77
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:03,630
mu

78
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,723
on on aging

79
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:07,240
and memory,

80
00:08:07,898 --> 00:08:10,793
and and the past and and your origin.

81
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,077
And and it's not until this seventh issue where it just kind of gets that classic

82
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:18,192
Scrooge mc Ducktales template

83
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,745
that this is like what what duck

84
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,480
is gonna focus on.

85
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:24,474
Exactly.

86
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:25,393
So

87
00:08:25,812 --> 00:08:28,908
so, yeah. This this this... I like this

88
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:29,747
story

89
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:34,196
a lot. This one is just a really good

90
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:35,195
pure

91
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,273
adventure story.

92
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:57,120
I love the twist and terms of this one. I read this. I remember, like, this one really fired my imagination as a kid, and I read my copy of this over and over. So the... This will be fun to talk about I I'd already mentioned a couple of the kind of background details

93
00:08:58,431 --> 00:09:06,725
this is one of the longer stories. We we won't have any more of his quote full length thirty two pager.

94
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:16,022
This twenty eight page length is is as long as he's gonna get to do at this point. Kinda hits a sweet spot, I think. I think, you know, this one

95
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,076
gets to play out pretty well.

96
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:38,405
It has not been reprinted as frequently as I would've have guessed to the it mind, it only has nine reprint in counting the original in the United States. I also realized that in in that reprint in that best of uncle screwed or Donald dot Scrooge from sixty seven. I believe

97
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:45,531
the the podcast listeners will correct me if I'm wrong. But I believe that's the first time that this un titled story...

98
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:50,374
Well, no. I take that Barks. There was... It it was called the seven cities of Si.

99
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:51,392
Originally,

100
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:56,240
I believe. Was that right mark? Did it have a title on the in in the original

101
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,955
I think that this was one of the un titled students originally

102
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,890
Yeah. You know, Barks had that correspondence

103
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:52,180
with with the a fan early on about potential titles for some of bullets. Yeah. Yeah. Now with with Will, and so he had proposed the seven cities. I think he proposed the seven cities of gold. And it officially land ended up landing on on Cy ebola. But for some reason like you said the the fan... The recent fan graphics went with the seven cities of gold. Yeah. And I I I... That's fine, I guess. It it tells the story. But I believe that this... That the first time it was really the seven cities of S ebola was in this reprint the school key reprint. It's isn't think that's right. Yeah. And and it's worth... It's definitely worth dwelling a little bit on on the actual legend here. Mh right. This is

104
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:55,267
boy this a really fascinating legend. Right?

105
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:06,311
The idea of the seven cities of gold is something that comes up in in American hi straight for a long, long time. And this

106
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:08,468
this legend,

107
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:09,827
arguably

108
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:13,360
is one of the most dangerous

109
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,780
stories in the world.

110
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,249
Because it it animated the spaniards when they came to the Americas,

111
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,841
and and it just it led to

112
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:27,316
all of these fruit list

113
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,770
searches for these supposed

114
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,490
cities where they were just cloud and gold

115
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,745
and full of mythical rich is. And and this is kind of the second time that Barks has

116
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:42,185
has feature this. Right? Because

117
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:52,892
the the El, the guild man yeah. Was was based on... It's like an overlap legend. Right? It's it's kinda of this oral legend

118
00:11:53,524 --> 00:11:55,977
that every European new

119
00:11:56,353 --> 00:12:03,326
quote that the Americas were full of riches if they could only find them and lot lots of lives

120
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:07,891
were lost in in pursuit of these cities.

121
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,635
Yeah And the research should that you and I both have done on this

122
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:12,755
Legend

123
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:17,715
takes us back to the sixteenth century to fifteen thirty nine to all of these great

124
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:20,090
excursions, which Barks points out

125
00:12:20,668 --> 00:13:00,636
to actually twist a little bit of fiction and fact in this story, which I thought was really a a brilliant storytelling technique and blending two different legends to kinda make the story even richer with with the the ship of the desert and and that sort of thing. So I thought it was really a fascinating way for for Barks to take, which I read in one of the critical of this story was originally he thought he had something like a ten page story. He did a twenty eight page story until he did more... He was... I think he was over... Hearing a conversation from an old man in a restaurant. Busy. Did you hear that one? Yeah. Yeah. He he called him. I I don't I didn't copy down Al quote, I don't think. But he called him like

126
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:13,976
it it was a very Barks and funny thing. He was like a notorious liar. The notorious liar who was telling a story that was absolutely not true, but to really bring the journey to the seven cities to a full adventure.

127
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:34,990
Right. He he just felt compelled to say, okay. Now I can make a long adventure story, and I can give... I can give Uncle Scrooge this vehicle to really showcase his this new personality this new quest forward more well. I mean, this Scrooge is a very different screws in the first screws we saw when he was just hun over in a chair and he could hardly, you know, kick get out of his chair.

128
00:13:35,444 --> 00:13:39,740
So I think this is true transition. It's worth reflect how much

129
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,018
how much we've changed from

130
00:13:42,357 --> 00:13:44,175
Christmas on on bare mount

131
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:45,407
So, you know,

132
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:57,807
I had alluded to a Cameo that Barks included. Yeah. With with a friend of his. Was it his editor I don't know. I wasn't clear on that. I I know he was a friend and they were having drinks and and

133
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:02,266
something. You wanna tell us a little bit, you wanna relate how this kinda went down? Yeah.

134
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:13,576
Barks was inspired with a visit of his friend. His name is Elk C or Cook. I don't know, but k o c a He was the manager of the Riverside Welfare office in,

135
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:14,853
California.

136
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:25,942
He was an authority on local Indian drives and toll Barks about an old Indian trail near thousand palms. Barks explore that trail and decided to use it to set the Ducktales the road.

137
00:14:26,694 --> 00:14:28,231
So I thought that was kinda fascinating.

138
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:30,266
And as a form of acknowledgment,

139
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:38,740
Barks drew him into the story in that wonderful seen where this really realistic looking man looking character, not a dog character.

140
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:48,699
Right. The Big Boys out of the welfare office, and that was his little tribute to his friend Al. Yeah. It's neat when he sneaks these little cameo in. So

141
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:51,975
I think that the kind of progression

142
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:58,133
of this story. This is something that I wanna be thinking about as we talked about it. It's it's one of the the

143
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,635
the really cool thing. Is how it starts on this really small scale. Mh.

144
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:05,775
Looking for Indian arrowhead

145
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:10,735
stumbling onto to this Indian trail And and then just eventually

146
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:15,342
progressing, to the seven cities of S. It's very...

147
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:27,888
It's very captivating to me. The adventure becomes more grand with every panel. Yes. Right. And I've gotta tell you when I read this, it would been... I would have been about nine years old. I'm thinking

148
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:39,295
and and there was a... There was a show at the time that was just a few years old called the mysterious cities of Gold. Who is this, like, joint production between

149
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:41,455
Japan and France? And

150
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:54,030
just really beautiful animation, kind of an incredible and deep story. And and I was absorbed in watching this, like, cereal story. I don't think there's anything else like from that era of animation.

151
00:15:54,885 --> 00:16:00,465
And and so I was just getting all this information. All this input about these these

152
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:01,705
mysterious

153
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:07,193
cities of gold. And so that that's... I I feel like they just figure

154
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:08,032
very...

155
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:15,445
This myth just cast along shadow and pop culture, I think. Well, it does and and we'll get to some of the other

156
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,358
great story of the modern era that Barks inspired with this story. As well. So...

157
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:28,110
Yeah. You know what? Let's not t's. This this is one of the things that everyone quote knows.

158
00:16:28,606 --> 00:16:39,811
Have the story. What what is this fun fact one? Well, certainly as as the story ends in in our comic, there's this wonderful scene where the big boys take the idle off of the

159
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:48,575
the mount there in the cave and the boulder starts throwing around excellent splash panel, we'll talk more about it. But certainly that inspired

160
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:51,104
Stevens Spielberg and George Lucas to

161
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,132
develop and further develop this action sequence at the beginning of

162
00:16:55,788 --> 00:17:00,055
Indiana Jones razors of the Long arc. I mean, that that to me, is the perfect

163
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:21,115
salute to the master story from two modern day story retailers. In the... In some of my research, I I just cringe when I said, yeah. They were... Spielberg and Lucas were having fun buying all of Barks oil paintings it's like oh come on they could afford it. Right? But but but he they decided to give him the greatest honor by putting something from

164
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:35,671
Into his their their film. So, yeah. Like one of one of Cinema, most iconic scenes that does seen from from Indiana Jones. I think it's lupus lucas himself he said was was specifically

165
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:44,072
inspired by this story. And and they're very different in their kind of, like, placement and progression, but but

166
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,542
Lucas himself has has... I I think he's even

167
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:50,533
done a couple of the four words for sidebar

168
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,185
collect.

169
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:54,456
Yeah. He was a Barks collector, a a a huge

170
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:55,333
fan

171
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,759
wrote the forward in in a few of the books that I have and...

172
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:15,655
But I was lucky enough to find a a book called art of Carl and it was one of his oil painting books. And I got it in auction because this was the book that he actually gave to George Lucas, and I have that one. Like the copy.

173
00:18:16,535 --> 00:18:17,315
Is if you

174
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:24,829
George Lucas. Thank you for and and I I I I gave it to my son for Christmas last year because he's such a huge

175
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:26,321
that's pretty doubt.

176
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,786
It's a pretty cool thing to have. I'll I'll this...

177
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:37,617
That's awesome. I would love to see a picture of that. I'll get a shot for you for the podcast. That would be neat. Yeah Alright. So...

178
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:47,695
Boy, yeah. Al lot lot of great stuff around this one. Let's let's go ahead and mention a couple of the titles. Would take a moment to pan to our international listeners.

179
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:52,054
Yeah. I'll I'll go ahead and just list a couple of the pretty straightforward

180
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:57,343
ones. I'm gonna try the French, which is Les set seated.

181
00:18:59,435 --> 00:19:00,551
The seven cities of.

182
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:05,755
And then I like the... I like the Danish why don't you do the the one from?

183
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:08,495
Yeah. That's a lot of fun. That's very different

184
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:13,825
from it's certainly not straightforward, but it's it reads far least teal pro,

185
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:15,939
no kia, I guess.

186
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:21,545
Sorry, baby my danish friends, makes you want to try something new is the translation.

187
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:29,640
I thought that was fun. Yeah. It seems to be alluding to Scrooge in the beginning of the story. Does. Yep. And then

188
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,600
German,

189
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,720
again is just a pretty straightforward

190
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,500
translation.

191
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,520
This

192
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:35,974
Dante

193
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:36,892
von

194
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:38,687
and

195
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:42,797
and that leaves you with Italy. Yeah. Again, a little bit more straightforward.

196
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,430
Scrooge

197
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,390
of the Severino

198
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,420
Yep Alright. So let's

199
00:19:54,077 --> 00:19:58,225
do it one. We're going to cover this story.

200
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,220
So,

201
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,380
you know, I've been having an exchange very recently

202
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,195
on Facebook where it it was pointed out

203
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:22,905
ruben and who's been on here couple of times. Just kinda highlighted. How many of these stories start out in the money bit. Right? And and I remember when I had y chemo an editor at E on. He was talking about how important it is that a good writer and artist.

204
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:23,905
Really

205
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:26,945
this character

206
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:31,935
every time. Right? Because you you don't know how many new reader.

207
00:20:32,654 --> 00:20:36,151
You might get on a given story. And so

208
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:38,858
It's fascinating to me how Barks.

209
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:44,383
He does such a good job of returning to this like familiar ground

210
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:50,465
adding something fresh to it. And and so we get this great establishing

211
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:54,340
bit of Scrooge as impossible rich

212
00:20:54,734 --> 00:21:03,545
in his money band. And it it just tells us a lot about the character each time. And and in in the case of this one in the seven cities of S ebola,

213
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:05,538
sc is

214
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:09,614
getting a money bath from his butt

215
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:12,665
which is a side character that we don't

216
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:15,217
see more than a couple of times.

217
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:17,449
Yeah. That I'm aware of. And

218
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:27,909
it's a very funny shot. Right? It's very screwed. Usually he's got a bathtub for this. If and it feels weirdly into intimate to me warren. Yeah. He doesn't have any close.

219
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:30,400
Yeah. Yeah. It's it's pretty odd.

220
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:35,914
And and and we don't usually see screws getting pam this way either. So

221
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:51,278
I I think Barks kinda tried this out and then probably was like, yeah, this doesn't feel very excruciating that like. And and what he's doing at the beginning here is he's listing off the many different ways he makes money, the different industries he's involved in.

222
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,496
It's it's all the kind of usual

223
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:58,649
suspect oil wells, railroads, gold mines, Barks, factories, steam shifts,

224
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,029
and he's very content

225
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:06,478
talking about how he's made money at on just about every business there is on Earth

226
00:22:06,817 --> 00:22:08,196
any kind of ponder

227
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:17,071
if there are any ways that he hasn't made money. And eventually, his his mood Do just a little bit because he's saying that

228
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:20,545
you know, his life is becoming Ducktales.

229
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:24,205
And so he wants he gets dressed he tends to go out

230
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,260
and see if there's anything new that he might have missed. Yeah. I love it. I I... He... He he's determined

231
00:22:31,614 --> 00:22:42,266
to find a new venture, and he says at the top of the second page, I love the risk. I love that line. Yeah. I I really like this opening. I think this is really strong.

232
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:54,795
This is kind of a theme that Barks will return to a few times and it's very in keeping with the character. Right? It's not it's not just enough for Scrooge to be rich.

233
00:22:55,468 --> 00:23:02,480
He wants to be good at being rich. He wants to master all the trades. He he likes the adventure.

234
00:23:02,894 --> 00:23:03,833
Of it, basically.

235
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:22,366
And Al you mentioned the opening panel, which all the splash panels in this story are fantastic. Mh. So this shot, I remembered as a kid just absolutely loving it. The first one. And then I go back and I look at all of the paintings that he's done about money bins and all the Lit ramps that have come from those paintings.

236
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,082
Barks was absolutely

237
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:27,116
enamored with the the money being

238
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:31,605
story and and the the the the gimmick. And and again, trying new gigs

239
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:32,784
you know,

240
00:23:33,903 --> 00:23:39,765
I love this almost as much as I, like, the diving like a purpose Yeah. Yeah such a good anchor for the character.

241
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:40,602
It

242
00:23:40,978 --> 00:23:41,478
And

243
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:47,112
so when he ventures out, basically the next couple of sequences

244
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:53,150
are gonna be about his his efforts to find something new.

245
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:59,643
To invest in to get good at. And and this this gives Barks a really good

246
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:09,351
systematic way to move the story forward. You wanna tell us about his first attempt one? Oh, yeah. It's great. Because a little Cameo by Jai Gu here in his one wheel motor.

247
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:16,385
And he sees it and and he lights up and says that says Al lot for you a million dollars, your too late Scrooge

248
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:29,715
Auto factory bought for fifty bucks And then he said, aren't, you Scrooge Big duck. I thought that was an interesting twist on this little character that, you know, my old pal and aren't screwed to big Barks Yeah. This this a really funny exchange like

249
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:36,549
that this is gonna be one of those kind of running character beats and guides that Barks use a lot. Scrooge

250
00:24:37,188 --> 00:24:38,167
being such

251
00:24:38,826 --> 00:24:43,500
octopus that he's not even aware of of all the things.

252
00:24:43,954 --> 00:24:45,571
That he's involved in.

253
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:51,473
You know, I just... I just did an episode about the ten page spending money where

254
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:57,350
where he famously, you know, just his unaware of all all of his personal businesses.

255
00:24:57,807 --> 00:24:58,626
And then I...

256
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:03,105
Yeah. This is part of that right here. Right. And I like that we get

257
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:04,862
Gyro rose goofy

258
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:13,619
single wheel and car here because Barks loves this thing. Right? He... He's been pepper it in. The background

259
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,356
of different stories.

260
00:25:15,995 --> 00:25:35,230
And I this is the first time you actually kind of, like highlights it, but but you see this in in all of these stories as just this random background guide. You do. That's a good point because I remember being it much smaller and just in a frame too. We get a good glimpse Al Gyro who came out what a few years earlier. Right? Right. And and this...

261
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:44,786
I was wondering if this little cameo is his first interaction with screw. I don't know. That's a good point. It might be so before going on to that

262
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:45,783
next

263
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:57,127
efforts to make money it's something new. I just gonna know I really like this guy Bark himself seems to really light this type of gag where someone

264
00:25:57,544 --> 00:25:58,044
doesn't

265
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:10,520
recognize someone else. And I I love it. It's great. It works for me. Why don't you also tell us about the the next effort? Well, after he he says he'd like to get into something simple,

266
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:14,443
that he can run with his own hands and so he sees this peanuts.

267
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:15,421
Peanut

268
00:26:16,237 --> 00:26:19,927
charming little, they think a peanut way would be a great way to

269
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:31,515
make some more money. I love the guy calls him short too bad short. I can't sell it. He doesn't know who's Scrooge just. And he says, well, it doesn't belong to me fridge mc dot owns and he all the Wagon in town and.

270
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:42,310
Says oh jeez. I it he offers him Al He storms off. Upset that the fact is lost his taste for peanuts now. So he's he's discouraged now he he he doesn't know what he doesn't own.

271
00:26:42,924 --> 00:26:51,895
Right. And and those two instances are enough to to give us the reader the idea. And and next, he's gonna encounter his nephews.

272
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:52,909
And

273
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:59,811
they let him know that they are on the way to the desert. To look for Indian arrowhead.

274
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:04,185
I like screws reaction. Like no. And

275
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:10,280
and donald explains that they can sell the arrowhead for fifty cents of peace.

276
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:11,760
And

277
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:21,075
Scrooge sees the opportunity there, but he goes to verify something first. And he he calls his bookkeeper to see if he has any companies in that realm.

278
00:27:21,755 --> 00:27:31,453
And I like that the bookkeeper is very gas and says that such a pun business would be beneath the dignity of a great billionaire like yourself. Right

279
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,002
So that settles it, you know, he's gonna join them.

280
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:36,061
And

281
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:44,303
this is a very Scrooge Inducks sorta of thing. Right? Like he's not his time would be much better used

282
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,457
quote unquote better

283
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:48,790
his time is incredibly valuable.

284
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:53,292
Spending hours to find these fifty cent arrow. Doesn't make sense

285
00:27:54,108 --> 00:28:01,998
except in the fact except for the fact that it's just he's a excited about it. And it's something new and it's it's this adventure.

286
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:08,074
It's a new adventure way to make some money. Right in a way it's it's it's a little bit akin to his

287
00:28:08,493 --> 00:28:30,075
you and looking for gold. I mean, it's it's is the adventure of finding the the item out there in the middle of nowhere. You know, And I like... I like his and Donald exchange for yeah. For fifty cents each I'd root arrowhead heads out of badger or holes with my bare nose and Donald tells him. Don't be so greedy. You may have to do it. That's right. And so

288
00:28:30,855 --> 00:28:33,529
next we transition to the great

289
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:39,163
of the west that... Which are mysterious regions as Barks notes in his

290
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:44,166
his narrator box. And and we don't know, like, exactly

291
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:45,698
where they're going.

292
00:28:46,535 --> 00:28:50,874
But we're we're gonna kinda have an idea that it's somewhere in the lake...

293
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:56,231
The really... What I consider the really gross part of California, right? We're looking at, like,

294
00:28:57,404 --> 00:29:00,720
Outside of Riverside, once you get into the Desert areas,

295
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,799
D o,

296
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:05,576
we we see a sign that says thousand homes.

297
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:13,130
So we're starting out in the deserts of California. This is not really far.

298
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:17,357
From civilization. Right? And Barks hadn't really established

299
00:29:17,695 --> 00:29:18,195
Duck.

300
00:29:18,813 --> 00:29:24,360
We we kinda know that Inducks is is isn't in California like play. So this is very

301
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:42,817
very possible. Right? This is Al plausible day trip. And and so the Ducktales start to look four arrowhead heads. And and they talk about state Inducks that used to live in the area. They talked about how, you know, you can look where they're... Where the game was to fall.

302
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,962
Warren, when you were a kid, did you have any Indian arrowhead?

303
00:29:47,554 --> 00:29:52,174
You know, that's a great question. I didn't, but my my my wife's

304
00:29:52,515 --> 00:29:54,215
grandfather collected indian because

305
00:29:54,728 --> 00:30:04,980
for many, many years at in his house before he passed, there was a huge frame with literally about forty arrowhead heads mounted in very beautifully

306
00:30:05,757 --> 00:30:10,686
aligned, you know, by size, and he found all of those in

307
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,840
you know, in South Dakota, North D dakota and in the Nebraska, Kansas when he what he traveled.

308
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:23,786
Yeah. I I have, like, a an old Cigar box Al few of these. My grand grew up in

309
00:30:24,243 --> 00:30:25,142
Oklahoma and Arkansas.

310
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:26,059
Right

311
00:30:26,517 --> 00:30:32,458
and would find these as a kid. Like this is this is a real pursuit that people really did that

312
00:30:33,236 --> 00:30:36,493
native Americans use these for thousands of years across

313
00:30:36,912 --> 00:30:43,217
across the the area. So this this is like something you can actually do and they're their fewer

314
00:30:43,715 --> 00:31:14,225
around to find, but... But this is definitely something real. And so the docs start to have some luck. I think for the reader, this is an exciting moment. Right? We see them finding these and and we enjoy it. Think the reader, Mark, I think for the reader, I also... This is the beginning of Barks history lesson here. He's really wanting to educate the reader a little bit through the so the humor and through the adventure of the story, I just loved the all of the references to where the game was plentiful and here's an had here and

315
00:31:14,922 --> 00:31:33,000
they have fun with it, but I... That's what I love about this. It as a kid. I just ate it all up. Yeah. It's a good point because they talk about, like, the ambush hunting Yeah the that the onions would have done and how they have to look at places like box canyon and stuff. And as they begin to have some luck, we get this little off offhand reference.

316
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:51,188
To... Shouldn't they take a campaign of water with them? But but they don't intend to be very long, Donald says And so as they find a really good spot and start to find arrowhead and spear heads and Scrooge find some stone acts and bone beads.

317
00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:55,196
He's very excited at his small scale fortunate in there.

318
00:31:56,368 --> 00:31:56,868
Suddenly,

319
00:31:57,845 --> 00:31:58,983
a dust

320
00:31:59,361 --> 00:32:09,845
storm comes up, a desert sands storm as they as they call it. So warren, when you... When your travels took here to Arizona, did you get to experience any of these?

321
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:12,645
Only once. I can't remember what they called them.

322
00:32:13,457 --> 00:32:17,323
There a name for that sudden sands store that kicks up. It's it's called a.

323
00:32:18,598 --> 00:32:31,170
Yeah. And and I did. I was in one. And I was in a hotel room though. I was not out in the middle of the desert. It was quite ominous and I can imagine this is kind of like that. Yeah. I mean, this is a pretty good depiction

324
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,390
of of a sudden storm a hub,

325
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:42,085
I mean, they they never last as long as he's gonna show them later in the story. These these these are serious business.

326
00:32:42,645 --> 00:32:43,145
So

327
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:50,945
the the dots are not able to get back to their car and and they they have to hold on to each other not to be separated.

328
00:32:51,522 --> 00:32:52,440
We're blown away.

329
00:32:53,173 --> 00:32:58,716
And and they quickly get lost. And this is the part of the story that takes this, like,

330
00:32:59,594 --> 00:33:02,345
happens dance turn. That's pretty cool.

331
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,377
Where they they stumble

332
00:33:04,794 --> 00:33:13,215
into this trail this groove in the ground. Yeah. The group's been there is definitely a established, and they use that as the trail to follow.

333
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:15,975
I love the exchange with the the Nephews.

334
00:33:17,115 --> 00:33:18,230
Where is it taking us

335
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:22,630
to a soda pop scan no doubt wouldn't surprised if it did.

336
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,550
But they are absolutely

337
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,030
surprised when they

338
00:33:26,624 --> 00:33:30,633
hit the the oasis right there. Right. And and,

339
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:37,668
you know, he mentions his desert polls. Those were not exactly native. A native speech but... But that's the okay.

340
00:33:38,487 --> 00:33:38,987
The...

341
00:33:39,886 --> 00:33:41,824
I we don't really see oasis

342
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:46,314
the way you do in other parts the world in the American Southwest.

343
00:33:47,689 --> 00:34:01,326
But that that's alright. So the that's, you know, they have their water, and this is gonna be one of the overriding themes of the story, the importance of having water with you and boy, Al someone who lived there long enough to consider himself and native.

344
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:03,260
He gotta half water in the desert.

345
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:03,954
Yeah.

346
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:12,076
I always feel thirsty on behalf of the characters in this one. Well, this was at a time too when I was ten years old. I was a boy scout, and

347
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:18,210
and I always knew the importance of being prepared on those hike side to up in Northern Minnesota. So so

348
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:24,575
there's this neat little element here where the... They're able to get a good look when the storm

349
00:34:24,953 --> 00:34:28,625
subside. I like how they can kinda look back and see the trail they followed.

350
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:34,961
And they figure out that it's this well attended old Indian trail that was worn

351
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:40,225
the with a groove that was worn down over thousands of years.

352
00:34:40,985 --> 00:34:47,060
And as they follow the trail, they come across amount of rocks Mh. Way

353
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,740
there is a hidden bit of pottery.

354
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,680
And do you might tell us what happens with the potter?

355
00:34:54,214 --> 00:34:59,539
One of the nephews picks up the pro, and it just breaks and outcome just these

356
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:03,367
these these jewels and and and screws just

357
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,757
looks at them ornaments of heavy gold,

358
00:35:06,316 --> 00:35:13,698
and he just leaves on them as if he was in his money, Then he just says let me take a look at that stuff. An expert on gold. And so he

359
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:15,930
he goes right at it, and

360
00:35:16,387 --> 00:35:23,337
he verifies that, yes, these are the real thing. This is the thousands of years old, Jewelry, and thanks to the nephew.

361
00:35:24,533 --> 00:35:31,326
Found. Yeah. Yeah. And and so we get a little d tours, they go back to... We do see that they're actually an

362
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:32,641
Yes.

363
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:37,386
Right in in the background it identifies the India Gym society.

364
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:40,257
And they they asked a professor

365
00:35:40,796 --> 00:35:41,296
to

366
00:35:42,394 --> 00:35:43,833
identify where it would have come from.

367
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:46,650
And we a little bit of hand waving here

368
00:35:46,965 --> 00:36:03,400
Right. This guy just knows that but that's okay. He's he's he's clearly Al authority. So he knows that it could have only come from one place and we get this neat little dramatic review. This is treasure from the original seven cities of symbol

369
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:09,274
And this is a... This is a favorite gag of Barks, Right? Where

370
00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:10,487
Scrooge

371
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:14,950
you wanna read us the line that the Nephew says? Oh, said.

372
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:20,932
Have you got some ice water, professor, there's a cash register ringing in uncle Scrooge head

373
00:36:21,324 --> 00:36:22,463
Right. And and

374
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:29,220
Scrooge being overcome by visions of a fortune is, of course, a class. Well, it it

375
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,260
is pupils, but every little expressive

376
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,780
flair out of him is a dollar sign, and that's again, he...

377
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,875
This is what he set out to do and he found this new fortune. So

378
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:44,767
Right. And and so we get this brief little history lesson for the benefit of readers,

379
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:46,760
where the Nephews talk about

380
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:56,182
the how those seven cities are the ones that explorers looked for for so long. The streets were said to be paid with gold

381
00:36:57,292 --> 00:37:05,047
And then Donald chimes in that... That story was a fake. The seven cities were found to be poor mud pueblo.

382
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:11,413
And and this is true. Right? The the yeah actually Correct. Yeah. Yeah. So

383
00:37:12,152 --> 00:37:13,745
I know that there was an x

384
00:37:14,645 --> 00:37:15,745
an expedition

385
00:37:16,245 --> 00:37:17,425
launched by

386
00:37:17,925 --> 00:37:19,085
the Pad Barks,

387
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:20,760
who

388
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,940
there's a high school near where I lived in tempe Arizona that was Barks

389
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,520
high four

390
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:34,087
Okay. So he's he's I think he's famous as, like, the first European supposedly in in the territory of Arizona.

391
00:37:34,706 --> 00:37:35,206
But

392
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:36,339
he

393
00:37:36,717 --> 00:37:38,933
apparently corroborate the story

394
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:40,171
someone's

395
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:44,081
reporting about the seven cities, and he led

396
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:48,255
Who is the Con the that he led? Was it coronado?

397
00:37:48,555 --> 00:37:51,935
Yeah. I think so. Yeah. He... He's the guy who led

398
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:53,095
from Francisco

399
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,350
from Francisco. Right? From Francisco day Coronado.

400
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:57,090
Right.

401
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:07,067
To to to mount and next expedition to find them and And when they got there, they were, like, deeply under overwhelmed to find though. It was like, these

402
00:38:07,404 --> 00:38:07,904
poor,

403
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,898
like mud pueblo

404
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,230
that

405
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,350
were at the Z Pueblo

406
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,110
in in New Mexico.

407
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:15,890
Right.

408
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:27,850
So the So Box is doing this good job a kind of mixing fact and fiction, and he's got this professor here who is an authority. And he's able to chime in and say, oh, were they fake?

409
00:38:29,286 --> 00:38:36,441
And he tells that the Never guided search to the real cities and that no white man has ever seen Cy ebola.

410
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:45,760
And and there is some sub opposition that the the very legend of them was basic like a native way of just getting them off their pack.

411
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,300
That's mh. But

412
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:54,051
but he he p ports to have some like artifacts that prove that they're real.

413
00:38:54,571 --> 00:38:56,429
And and so the docks

414
00:38:57,008 --> 00:38:59,546
they they sense that they have

415
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:14,776
they've got kinda of this in where they they have the best chance of finding the cities and that they can just follow that old indian trail. They do in it but it starts off with Uncle sk asking the professor, but where are they? And he says, hey, if I knew,

416
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:28,631
I go there myself. So there's still this mystery. You're right? And then they get... They had to go back to the trail to hopefully find at the end of that indian trail where they might find it. Yeah, it's interesting that the professor Ponder briefly in Spanish. Right? He said.

417
00:39:29,446 --> 00:39:32,537
Can solve it? I knew I'd go there myself.

418
00:39:33,568 --> 00:39:36,002
Yeah. Everyone while Barb does that. Mh.

419
00:39:37,438 --> 00:39:40,670
So so the next sequence is pretty funny to me worn.

420
00:39:41,763 --> 00:39:49,980
We're we're introducing the legal boys into the store. Do you wanna tell us about this? Well, as as screw and dot of the nephews go to the cafe to kinda

421
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,980
strategize their next step.

422
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,060
We see...

423
00:39:53,840 --> 00:40:00,315
Again, this is a character chair drawing of Barks as friend who actually works for the Welfare apartment in Riverside.

424
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:04,555
It says it right there aid for the bo Riverside County Welfare, and he's kicking

425
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:26,918
the five boys out saying you bum were tired of you giving you relief checks and the the depiction of him is of his friend Al, who he strategize the story with. So what a nice little way to put them in there, But I just love... I love the way the big boys now are just sitting on the pavement outside the the County Welfare office, and they're complaining that there they are needy cases.

426
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:31,903
You're kicking us out here to starve where we're gonna go eat and they start falling and crying.

427
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:39,595
And I love this line. I have to read it. Since Barks put in burglar alarms, we've had a hard time making ends meet

428
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:48,622
So and tired of jail cooking. It's just classic. Yeah. I'm glad you highlighted that line. I like that. I love it. This is a very whining

429
00:40:49,294 --> 00:40:49,794
n

430
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:52,824
version of the B boys. This is also

431
00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:08,072
this is also one of Barks frequent, like, kind of poking at the Welfare state. Yeah. He he doesn't like it. No. It's evidence through the... Yeah. That's true. Right. And and he also does these frequent little gigs

432
00:41:08,904 --> 00:41:12,855
kind of suggesting that criminal justice to system Ducktales

433
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:15,032
criminals like the b boys.

434
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:27,440
That definitely is evident here in this And, of course, but only... The only way that I kinda buy this is that we know who the bigger old boys are, They're they are taking advantage of the system. They are burglar there not good people

435
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:33,381
and so I'm okay with them getting kicked out, but I never thought of it as a commentary by Barks that's interesting.

436
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:39,125
Yeah. It's it's funny. And but it's just just definitely a little bit of Barks editorial.

437
00:41:39,942 --> 00:41:40,442
Question.

438
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:50,185
You'll you'll see it later in in what's it called house of house of Hot? Is that what it's called? That late story where the b boys are cons.

439
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:57,770
Anyway, I do love... I've do love the artwork and done this in many stories who where at the end of that page, you see the big boys,

440
00:41:58,108 --> 00:42:05,286
all with their hands on the shoulders walking off in line, we've seen that so many times. It's just whether they learned that in prison

441
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:13,225
or that's just how these these boys behave. I just love that Yeah. It does look kinda like a jail lineup up for something. That does love.

442
00:42:13,905 --> 00:42:20,595
So the beagle boys, they're they're very conveniently here, and they're gonna stumble on the du in the diner.

443
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:21,655
And,

444
00:42:22,155 --> 00:42:25,355
you know, they they've got their immediate assumptions Scrooge

445
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:31,058
is always into some kind of big rich business so they plan to

446
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:35,343
quote listen in on his diamonds studded words.

447
00:42:35,682 --> 00:42:43,886
And so they over here their plans to set out and find the seven cities. There's a very fun couple of common

448
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:44,898
complimentary

449
00:42:45,394 --> 00:42:47,369
panels at the end of this page worn

450
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,140
where the Inducks

451
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,571
toast to their adventure the next day.

452
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:55,721
And then the beagle boys is very, like, self satisfied

453
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,400
snugly also

454
00:42:57,739 --> 00:42:59,637
toast to their Identical.

455
00:43:00,296 --> 00:43:07,970
That's a it's a fun parents. So you see the b boys and and the ducks kinda go back and forth. Now, the next six sequences, you see them,

456
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,505
both on the same quest now

457
00:43:10,923 --> 00:43:14,453
the big boys, however, are following the Ducktales and it's an interesting

458
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:21,850
trade off yeah. Exactly. That's exactly right. And and the the next couple of pages. They're not too

459
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,730
consequential.

460
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:30,620
It's really about it's really about the journey The it is... They are really interesting because there's some really cool

461
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:32,977
lovely desert scenery,

462
00:43:33,316 --> 00:43:33,816
and

463
00:43:34,395 --> 00:43:38,365
it's it's fun to see the beagle trail the Ducktales.

464
00:43:38,405 --> 00:43:45,795
We get to see the Nephews bust out the junior guy... The Junior wood check guide book couple of times when they get a little bit s.

465
00:43:47,215 --> 00:43:52,275
We we figured that that's the only way the docs are able to make it likely farther

466
00:43:52,710 --> 00:44:13,385
we imagine that people have probably followed this trail before, I think But the guide book is what gives them yet. Right. And I go Scrooge acknowledges that and says that the boys of god is here through their their knowledge from the Junior wood chunks annual. And again, these two pages, as you said, really nothing much happens here, but a little bit more education.

467
00:44:13,762 --> 00:44:19,102
And and we establish the the big boys following them from a great distance.

468
00:44:19,558 --> 00:44:22,985
Right. And and it definitely makes it feel like a journey. Yeah.

469
00:44:23,782 --> 00:44:28,726
And and we see the Ducktales ford the Colorado River. Mh So

470
00:44:29,464 --> 00:44:38,315
we we can assume now that they've crossed this that's the state line, basically, they've crossed over into Arizona Al this point. Right?

471
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:43,788
And and once they make it across, they run out

472
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:46,186
of trail to follow.

473
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:46,885
Mh.

474
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:54,307
And and there some conversation about how, you know, some some big flood must have deposited

475
00:44:54,884 --> 00:45:00,448
si. And so they... Barks make sure to highlight that they need to fill or

476
00:45:01,025 --> 00:45:04,336
with water. And and when we pick up on the beagle

477
00:45:05,155 --> 00:45:06,792
hours behind them,

478
00:45:07,272 --> 00:45:10,185
tell us about that. They are coming to the Colorado.

479
00:45:10,485 --> 00:45:11,385
They're aching,

480
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:22,983
hiking is worst torture than the prison Rock quarry. They really are ready to give up and head home. But then they they cross the river. And then one of the masks about filling their

481
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:33,918
and one of them says on w... Well, we don't have time for that. There'll be a spring ahead. Well, that comes back to haunt them. Right. And and they've had to rush Yeah. Has...

482
00:45:34,256 --> 00:45:42,474
I think they had the rush because of the... Was it the storm. Right. A big dust storm. That's the which which is why they have to like, make.

483
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:47,788
It lasted two days, so they really wanna make a time on wisely did that filter their their.

484
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:56,144
Right. And I've never seen a dust storm last that long there. That. But, you know, I did... I did live in the well developed area.

485
00:45:56,681 --> 00:45:57,779
So we

486
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:00,331
transitioned a part of the story where

487
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:10,175
everyone's having to really carefully rash in their water. Yeah. The beagle boys are they they haven't... They haven't been careful about Al storing theirs.

488
00:46:11,308 --> 00:46:15,364
And so they they end up getting stuck in a dry rocky

489
00:46:16,062 --> 00:46:21,471
being too weak to climb out. And they they they're in pretty bad straits.

490
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:23,370
And so

491
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:38,873
the Ducktales also get down to the point where they only have one more drink of water. And we see them deciding to rash it and preparing to cross a swell that being the shortest way to the amount. Right. Right.

492
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:46,085
And it's funny that Barks doesn't show us obviously, the Ducktales are about to collide with the beagle.

493
00:46:46,858 --> 00:46:49,671
He keeps the the comics camera and

494
00:46:50,048 --> 00:46:51,744
outside, and we just imagine

495
00:46:52,600 --> 00:47:09,807
Al the narrator Barks ten seconds later which which which me I had to reread this a few times, Barks just so from a contact context standpoint, it looks like the big boys actually caught up to them and passed them up if they were already in the soil. Yeah. I I had to imagine that they've kind of

496
00:47:10,185 --> 00:47:24,320
maybe been circling a little bit. They don't have the clean trail to follow now. But we had to bring them together at some point, and this was the vehicle to do that. Right. It's it's funny that the doctor only learned that the B boys are in this story, so many pages in.

497
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:35,615
So anyway, the the beagle do what we'd expect they steal the Ducktales water, and they decide that they're gonna head back. This has been too close to the call. For the... Yeah Yeah.

498
00:47:37,107 --> 00:47:45,880
And Scrooge is optimistic because, you know, he thinks... Well, you know, Al least now we know it's only us that are on our way to the seven cities.

499
00:47:46,815 --> 00:47:53,055
But Donald is more realistic about the fact that they are out of water and in grave danger.

500
00:47:53,588 --> 00:47:54,088
And

501
00:47:55,421 --> 00:48:00,281
we're we're about to hit this cool little x... Kind of an extra sequence almost.

502
00:48:01,454 --> 00:48:07,155
Where the docs bump into this other sort of urban legend of the American

503
00:48:07,535 --> 00:48:15,049
Southwest. You wanna tell us about Yeah. The the the this other Urban legend as you call it is this this lost ship in the desert,

504
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:16,609
which they discover

505
00:48:17,203 --> 00:48:24,159
They think it's a mirage there and sure if they're looking at it or not, but they see an old Al, and it turns out to be very real. The

506
00:48:25,189 --> 00:48:34,355
nephews look Al the the do to up man and verify that this is the law of the desert, which has been seen several times in the last four centuries.

507
00:48:34,855 --> 00:48:39,914
Now the reality of this this table of this is actually about two hundred years later

508
00:48:40,508 --> 00:48:58,847
than the actual story of the sub seven cities. But Barks to creative license and kinda blended the two stories to bring it a that adventure as I said earlier a little bit longer and a little bit more richer. So I do love this part where this this bolt just sitting out the ship sitting out there. And so they rush on board,

509
00:48:59,344 --> 00:49:13,845
they go down into the galley and they see water cast, which, hard believe there'd be still water, but Yeah. That there's just a little bit in there. So they did get some water. I would not personally drink it but they do and it wet their whistles and

510
00:49:14,438 --> 00:49:28,244
we've made the second biggest find in the desert they say next to the seven cities themselves. Yeah. You you said how much you like this. I really like this too. Right? Yes like it's almost like this this extra little mini adventure this extra

511
00:49:28,545 --> 00:49:41,070
discovery that they weren't even looking for is is what saves them and route to the to the real price. Yeah. I like the romantic nature of but just this boat out there and there and they're... It just adds to the whole adventure story.

512
00:49:41,683 --> 00:49:45,571
Yeah. It it does. And and as you say, this is a quote real

513
00:49:46,028 --> 00:49:46,528
legend

514
00:49:47,862 --> 00:49:53,238
and and it's easy to see why. Right? It's it's as you said, it's very romantic to imagine this

515
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,840
serious ship in the desert where you wouldn't expect it. Mh.

516
00:49:57,814 --> 00:50:08,487
And and so they they investigate further and they find the ship's log book intact. And it explains that it is the story of of captain from francisco

517
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:11,343
Oo, who's sailed west from Lower

518
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:16,249
California in fifteen thirty nine. And was never seen again.

519
00:50:16,706 --> 00:50:22,885
The Nephews note that fortunately, Scrooge can speak Spanish. Mh. Reed Spanish and and Barks

520
00:50:23,859 --> 00:50:39,995
notes in a little caption that Oo is the commander of Cortez this fleet. Which is affected. I think he he inserted fact in there to bring some of that fiction in fact together to verify it. And as he said in one of is... I think it was in Thomas Andre Book.

521
00:50:40,649 --> 00:50:42,749
No one's gonna check me on this. Right.

522
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,189
He he does that so well. He does

523
00:50:46,489 --> 00:50:46,989
just

524
00:50:47,369 --> 00:50:47,869
enough

525
00:50:48,289 --> 00:50:50,958
research. To give it this, like, v

526
00:50:51,295 --> 00:50:51,795
of

527
00:50:52,251 --> 00:50:54,424
just enough. Of you're.

528
00:50:54,841 --> 00:51:00,669
See. To make it totally work. And and the log book, it's it's a really great pi

529
00:51:01,009 --> 00:51:01,489
explanation.

530
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:08,515
They... This was the last route where they were... The Expedition was looking for the seven cities.

531
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:09,393
And

532
00:51:09,731 --> 00:51:16,611
the... On this last voyage, they were caught in a great tide, which swapped the ship up the river, forty weeks or more.

533
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:29,194
Where upon a great birth earthquake lifted the river and hurled its waters far east word. And and thus explaining how the ship came to rest where it was. And at the end of it,

534
00:51:29,808 --> 00:51:33,661
Scrooge says, oh, but the best part is here

535
00:51:34,518 --> 00:51:41,264
where it says that they looked over the bow and saw a great host of onions coming from a clef in the cliffs

536
00:51:41,644 --> 00:51:43,844
who are dressed in gold. Yeah.

537
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,744
That ominous

538
00:51:46,044 --> 00:51:48,719
was the last entry in the book

539
00:51:49,219 --> 00:52:05,559
They figure they must have been Inducks from Zavala. Yeah. It all now pulls. It all comes together with these two legends. Right. And and this is just he's creating this out of whole cloth, but the way he's stitched it all together, just if it's such a great progression, and it feels

540
00:52:05,897 --> 00:52:11,144
so believable, and it's it's been about, I guess, twenty pages or so, roughly.

541
00:52:12,422 --> 00:52:14,080
Is until we get to this this

542
00:52:14,634 --> 00:52:28,352
the methodology or this wonderful lawyer and this story really unfolding now. Yeah. Yeah. And and like, that's not that much time. But it... The journey is felt pretty ar. He's done a good job of making this feel like Al feel like a big journey.

543
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:30,184
So Tell us about

544
00:52:30,803 --> 00:52:41,145
What the nephew you sees warren? Well, first of all, the nephew is up on the the mask and and looks forward. It says the clef he saw must be that one and the right in line with the ship is this

545
00:52:41,483 --> 00:52:42,821
clef in the in the hills

546
00:52:43,279 --> 00:52:44,437
and so they all come...

547
00:52:45,115 --> 00:52:59,963
On Scrooge urges them to run toward their they're just thrilled. They go up this little narrow path, and it... It's a very much reminds me of the ne path that Indiana Jones would go. Right? It's just an into into the into this And and there's this, again, another

548
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:02,612
incredible for me memorable splash panel.

549
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:06,040
When you see all the seven cities of Ebola,

550
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:23,310
in their own little area and all Scrooge can say is well, doesn't that take the cake, I love it. I just, like, get there in awe and that's what he says. What do you think of this panel? Mark? Oh, yeah. This is like, one of the all time memorable splash panels.

551
00:53:23,884 --> 00:53:26,960
As you say, it's great it's icon. The du,

552
00:53:27,319 --> 00:53:30,815
just are in awe of it. I think the reader

553
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,145
is to. It's it's

554
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:38,064
very striking. And his artwork he he depicts each of the cities

555
00:53:38,483 --> 00:53:40,418
in their own little area

556
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:50,409
with the colored rock being different, so you can actually count the seven cities here to verify that this is what they finally found. Right. And it's interesting that it's seven cities

557
00:53:51,029 --> 00:54:07,259
altogether. Right? Because because there it it really is one big community, but but they are delineate in a way that I'm sure everyone who reads this the first time counts them. I don't wanna you wanna see that there are there are actually seven of them. And and their styles

558
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:08,219
they're

559
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:11,479
after, like, the the quick cliff dwelling.

560
00:54:12,094 --> 00:54:13,313
Yes. That

561
00:54:14,331 --> 00:54:14,831
tribe

562
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:21,194
did. Right? And and this was something that Barks model at after his beloved National

563
00:54:21,531 --> 00:54:23,027
geographic, there was a feature

564
00:54:23,563 --> 00:54:27,190
called the ancient Cliff dwelling dwell of Mesa Their.

565
00:54:28,524 --> 00:54:47,454
And and so this is this is what what Barks used. For the actual cities themselves, and I... It's kinda neat. Right? It it it leaves in that little factual element that they were just these quote mud pueblo But when they get in there, it it really is very rich. And it's this very

566
00:54:48,434 --> 00:54:49,749
striking. There these

567
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:51,429
there are these pillars

568
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:54,869
supporting the clips Yes. That

569
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:56,189
are

570
00:54:56,649 --> 00:55:04,444
really in pose. Now don't don't think too too hard about the mechanics of this city. Because then then it does fall apart.

571
00:55:06,016 --> 00:55:15,512
But for a comic book adventure story, it's it's very gross. And to know that these are the first people to actually discover these after thousands of years is is another

572
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:35,467
probably unbelievable event, but it's it's great to see them all look up and awe. And and just realize that they've made it right. And and so Scrooge kinda recap the story for us helpful here. He says the seven cities of Si, and we found them because we were curious about an old Indian trail.

573
00:55:36,305 --> 00:55:41,849
Do you wanna tell us about some of the sites they find weren't? Yeah. I think they...

574
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:45,049
They they looked down at the the bricks

575
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:48,409
the nephew say, it looks like yellow bricks, and

576
00:55:48,764 --> 00:55:52,494
Scrooge immediately knows that those are gold bricks. They look at baskets,

577
00:55:52,871 --> 00:55:55,485
woven out of gold, of gold nuggets

578
00:55:55,823 --> 00:55:59,209
and and sister in full of op and South fires

579
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:01,920
and jewels beyond anyone's imagination.

580
00:56:02,536 --> 00:56:04,750
They look. Everything is here that

581
00:56:05,765 --> 00:56:06,943
solid ruby Arrowhead

582
00:56:07,574 --> 00:56:14,066
Barks really likes this. There's only a handful of stories I guess, but but I think there's some it was most memorable.

583
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:17,752
Right? Like, when they when they get down into the minds of king solomon,

584
00:56:18,328 --> 00:56:32,964
he really takes pains. He he likes to depict all these different forms of riches. And oh yeah. The different types of riches that are out there the jewels, the gold, that the... The the... Yeah. Right. And and while the docks are basking and all this,

585
00:56:33,777 --> 00:56:37,267
all this treasure, the beagle have decided that they're gonna

586
00:56:38,043 --> 00:56:54,339
they they feel emboldened by their one drink of water so they decide I don't know. Maybe they made it back and and tanked up somewhere else, but they decide to go back and finish the job and and they're able to pick up on the Duff trail pretty easily. And then we see

587
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:55,259
this

588
00:56:55,759 --> 00:57:03,413
idle. Tell us tell us more about the idle. Well, the idle but when you see it when I read it as a as a young boy,

589
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:07,419
it's stood out as sort of the find of the year here for for

590
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:08,079
Scrooge.

591
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:13,419
He calls it the single most valuable object in the whole world and

592
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:20,194
nephews, of course, no. It's a baby trap and don't touch it. But this is Pure Emerald. It's sitting up there on

593
00:57:20,494 --> 00:57:21,849
the the perch

594
00:57:22,628 --> 00:57:29,082
and it's definitely brake up to a b trap, which then is easily explained in the next few panels in this great artwork

595
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:31,080
of this immense boulder

596
00:57:31,394 --> 00:57:36,688
and the boulder is perched upon this thin column of bricks and stone

597
00:57:37,506 --> 00:57:46,530
and they realized that yep you were to take that idle, it would vary the seven cities here. And now we're temp up on that scene which is we talked about earlier from

598
00:57:46,844 --> 00:57:54,396
routers of the lost arc. Yeah. It's a it's it's a doom state device, basically. It is. It is. This will destroy it and... Yeah.

599
00:57:55,395 --> 00:58:03,531
The the idle itself. It's supposed to be this Giant Emerald that it does not look very, like, place accurate

600
00:58:04,044 --> 00:58:06,624
to me. I don't I don't know Southwest

601
00:58:07,044 --> 00:58:16,299
art that well, but I... But I I spent enough time there to be like, yeah, that doesn't look very very originally accurate. This it looks kind of generic.

602
00:58:17,499 --> 00:58:26,203
Oh, okay. It's nothing yeah. Deck or. Yeah. I I don't know. It it... Yeah. It kinda looks Al tech in a way that it shouldn't.

603
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,877
Right. So so this is a trope

604
00:58:29,335 --> 00:58:29,729
that

605
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:33,998
appears in a ton of these kind of adventure things. Right? An ancient

606
00:58:34,455 --> 00:58:34,955
civilization

607
00:58:35,452 --> 00:58:38,145
has like, this Doom day device that

608
00:58:38,602 --> 00:58:42,567
and we know it's it's like it's like check gone. Right.

609
00:58:43,605 --> 00:58:45,381
We know that it's... The audience

610
00:58:46,078 --> 00:58:47,595
wants to see it happen.

611
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:53,077
We know that this almost always happens. It's very exciting. It's very interesting.

612
00:58:53,515 --> 00:59:07,968
But, like, as I get older, I can't help but think how the mechanics of such a thing like falls apart. Right? Who who leaves something intact like that? Long enough for their civilization to just disappear how does this boulder

613
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:11,044
stay in place over thousands of years

614
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:16,334
I'll tell you if if the United States have like a button

615
00:59:16,674 --> 00:59:18,974
that was designed to ob obliterate us

616
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,334
that was this

617
00:59:20,634 --> 00:59:21,134
accessible

618
00:59:22,314 --> 00:59:25,709
I don't think we go more than forty eight hours. For some

619
00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:29,049
just like frantically push the button. So.

620
00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:58,394
You're right. You're right. But it is a... It is a fun control. We've seen it time and time again in the adventure movies and in these comics where they they they rig this up And especially the the... What you just mentioned, which really hit me at home was the bag up with thousands of years. The earth didn't settle enough to knock it hold on a little bit. Right. It it falls apart under a little bit of consideration, but but it definitely works in that, like, sort of comic book realm.

621
00:59:59,327 --> 01:00:03,017
Just just one little sour note for me though. But

622
01:00:03,634 --> 01:00:05,370
they yeah, like, it... The boulder

623
01:00:05,707 --> 01:00:10,134
itself is of course, very much the the Indiana Jones

624
01:00:10,514 --> 01:00:14,854
boulder, but but also this kind of pressure plate. Right? I... Now I...

625
01:00:15,234 --> 01:00:21,159
As soon as I see this idle, I think through Throw me the idle. I'll throw you the width. Pretty exactly yes.

626
01:00:22,874 --> 01:00:24,744
Alright. So the doc

627
01:00:25,362 --> 01:00:34,649
just like they... So the Ducktales do give the idle some wide birth. They... They're smart enough to be like, okay. Don't mess with that.

628
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:40,304
They they continue to explore this. And and just like they discovered this

629
01:00:40,682 --> 01:00:47,255
ships log of kind of the last days of the voyage. They discover this picture riding on the wall.

630
01:00:48,146 --> 01:00:49,084
That also

631
01:00:49,581 --> 01:00:50,617
explains what happened.

632
01:00:51,214 --> 01:01:06,748
And it says that, you know, they use their guide book of course. And it it says that with with that a great sickness came with the white men on the big canoe. On the people fell ill and all went to the happy Hunting round,

633
01:01:07,187 --> 01:01:26,541
and that the that wrote this was the last to go. Mh. That's a pretty sobering thing to include. Right? And it it really is and on and Dials reaction is is is actually quite nice. It's the poor guys, all their gold and jewels couldn't buy their good health back. I mean that's a really nice little lesson

634
01:01:27,093 --> 01:01:29,705
I think that Barks put in there. Right. And

635
01:01:30,122 --> 01:01:37,939
and I mean, this is, like, this is what happens too much the the arrival of the Huey, the doors and and the

636
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:42,019
and the European settlers was was a form of apocalypse

637
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,099
for the native

638
01:01:43,439 --> 01:01:44,634
population. Absolutely.

639
01:01:45,293 --> 01:01:51,066
And and small Barks wiped out and all these settle many of these settlements and villages.

640
01:01:51,858 --> 01:01:52,358
So

641
01:01:52,854 --> 01:02:07,344
so that definitely rings sadly true. And the debts keep looking and they kind of ponder what happened to those home keys to doors, one of the nephews is like, oh, we haven't seen their arm or what came of it. Mh. And how me get this little

642
01:02:08,244 --> 01:02:09,679
little scare beat

643
01:02:10,934 --> 01:02:12,231
yeah, kind of a ghostly

644
01:02:12,607 --> 01:02:13,505
almost a ghostly

645
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:35,464
visit if you will, where, you know, the nephew sets it up with where what happened to the armor, and all of a sudden, we see these shadows these omni shadows and the clan of them. Yeah. They they are right away. I don't think really realized where they are in that last panel. Right. And and, you know, we learned pretty quickly that it's the b boys. They've found this armor and they've put it on as a Barks

646
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:40,889
And and we have this... Now we get this confrontation where the B boys

647
01:02:41,745 --> 01:02:45,929
say that they want all of this fantastic wealth. And

648
01:02:46,626 --> 01:02:49,201
it's pretty g what they do. Right? They

649
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:53,432
tell us about what they do. So, the they all... They they do

650
01:02:54,184 --> 01:03:04,803
throw all of the Inducks into they're... They say they're going to jail them and they break up a wall to for them if you will. They're they're they're sealed in in a wall behind

651
01:03:05,301 --> 01:03:15,239
bricks in right. And, you know, the the beagle are so goofy in this. But but Severino once while they Yeah. Are very men. This is a medicine scene

652
01:03:15,738 --> 01:03:18,955
You know, Scrooge offers the a trillion dollars to let them go

653
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:23,097
That'll be chicken feed compared to what we're gonna take out of here. You know?

654
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:24,634
So

655
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,861
now what I find interesting on this is that they they take off the armor

656
01:03:29,334 --> 01:03:44,820
and they begin diving into the money just like Scrooge dives and right another story. I think the big boys they tried to do this and that was Scrooge attempt to stop them because they hit the... They hit the money and they they backed. Right. Well, that's classically his

657
01:03:45,317 --> 01:04:12,207
his means of stopping them and only a world old man. That's right. And it's... But it's not from quite that same height at least that's true. But they think I the money. Yeah know. Yeah. So this this wraps up pretty predictably here. Right. The the Ducktales were smart enough to leave that idle alone. But as the beatles are re and all this wealth around them, a couple of them spot it and

658
01:04:12,546 --> 01:04:18,694
and they start to sc with it arguing over, who can have it in in who's mansion.

659
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:22,184
And and they trigger

660
01:04:22,601 --> 01:04:24,257
the the doom day

661
01:04:24,793 --> 01:04:25,869
device than the the

662
01:04:26,786 --> 01:04:30,950
Have left behind. I tell you if I was an average citizen of

663
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:32,650
And

664
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:33,930
my leaders

665
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:37,130
said alright people, we have a grand plan

666
01:04:37,484 --> 01:04:37,984
to

667
01:04:38,321 --> 01:04:42,588
to create a Doom day device. If anyone jo this one idle,

668
01:04:43,386 --> 01:04:52,478
we're. And we're we're all gone, everything is gonna be destroyed. I would not vote for that person to the you again. Right.

669
01:04:52,816 --> 01:04:57,960
So it's that's a a pretty scary proposition for the for a society too.

670
01:04:58,658 --> 01:04:59,158
Something.

671
01:05:00,374 --> 01:05:04,706
Yeah. It doesn't make sense. It's true. The moment we see that boulder

672
01:05:05,059 --> 01:05:10,354
at the beginning and these pillars and we see the mechanics of of how it's gonna happen. We want

673
01:05:10,733 --> 01:05:11,632
to see it

674
01:05:13,585 --> 01:05:18,785
and and it's pretty spectacular as ko as it can be on the on the page.

675
01:05:19,305 --> 01:05:22,020
Right? For something that got so much motion.

676
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,980
The way the boulder does what it does. And and the city

677
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,114
collapse is pretty

678
01:05:28,531 --> 01:05:29,031
spectacularly.

679
01:05:29,528 --> 01:05:30,804
With our Inducks

680
01:05:30,804 --> 01:05:34,135
sealed nicely. Yeah the wall. They are able to

681
01:05:34,473 --> 01:05:42,189
know what's going on and Scrooge looks out. And says he'll never see his bill of money again. Yeah. And and the beagle are trapped,

682
01:05:42,868 --> 01:05:53,135
everyone gets buried, and and everyone should be should be killed Yeah. But but another instance of of cartoon logic. Boy, it's a it's a pretty big

683
01:05:53,595 --> 01:05:54,915
instance of cartoon logic.

684
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,241
Yeah. They Al escape. Mh.

685
01:05:57,959 --> 01:06:00,013
Yeah. So everyone eventually

686
01:06:01,545 --> 01:06:02,045
eventually

687
01:06:02,422 --> 01:06:02,922
emerges.

688
01:06:03,314 --> 01:06:16,408
From from Beneath the rubble. And you wanna tell us about what's happened to every character warren. Yeah. I I found this to be... I I I gave you village and comic book logic and just

689
01:06:17,104 --> 01:06:19,558
substantial humor and everything. But here every

690
01:06:20,095 --> 01:06:24,679
member that was in there, the Ducktales and the big boys all emerge safely

691
01:06:25,177 --> 01:06:27,033
from this wreckage

692
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:32,200
with amnesia. They all have bumps on their head and they can

693
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,120
remember

694
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:44,890
why they're there. And I thought like, okay, what a great way to wrap this story and keep the mystery of the seven cities alive. And I thought that was in a way brilliant in a way like, oh, come on.

695
01:06:46,246 --> 01:06:57,962
I'm much How did you take that? It's it's definitely a bit of a cop out and yeah. You know, knowing that just an Al as of a couple of issues ago, he was still

696
01:06:58,697 --> 01:07:08,370
two issues ago, Secret of Atlanta was the last thirty two pager. Yeah. And and I've I've can't help but wonder. Okay. Well, if if we had four more pages,

697
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,710
would he have wrapped this up a little bit more satisfying?

698
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:13,510
It... It's a fun little

699
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:18,194
camper of a gag. Right? He's guy amnesia. So the only thing that he remembers

700
01:07:18,771 --> 01:07:21,085
screwed remembers his arrowhead Hunting.

701
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:36,165
Yeah. And the pads. That word is pocket. Yeah. Right. Right. Four arrowhead that he lost in his pocket, but it's not worth digging through that pile of rubble for two bucks. Of course, the reader knows that there's a countless

702
01:07:36,785 --> 01:07:39,580
billions of dollars under there. Yeah But

703
01:07:40,437 --> 01:07:48,604
those four extra pages would've have brought. I I gotta believe it would have been a little bit more grand. Yeah. And and I mean he's able to do some great storytelling

704
01:07:49,062 --> 01:07:55,268
in a lot of different lengths sure. So maybe maybe this is just how he did want to end the story.

705
01:07:56,259 --> 01:08:09,765
Al amnesia like a common trope. He doesn't go to that well very often. And he doesn't... It's kinda of the edge sketch. Right? How do you get everything kinda back to normal? Yeah. I mean, we don't see the Ducktales. They obviously have a lot of deserts to make it

706
01:08:10,665 --> 01:08:11,505
back across.

707
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:12,579
But...

708
01:08:13,117 --> 01:08:24,652
But but the story ends very much back to status quo. And So I I think the ending. I think he really wanted to do what he did and have that spectacular

709
01:08:25,071 --> 01:08:25,571
destruction

710
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:26,309
of.

711
01:08:27,268 --> 01:08:29,685
I think he wanted to take the dots on this cool

712
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:30,540
journey.

713
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:34,854
And and then when the story ended, he was pretty much done. So,

714
01:08:35,473 --> 01:08:38,211
you know, his energy, he really investors his energy

715
01:08:38,684 --> 01:08:42,451
in the places that you wanted to in this sure. The the travels,

716
01:08:42,788 --> 01:08:46,290
the big boys following the doug, the discovery of the ship

717
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:51,120
all the trials of of finding water and staying hydrated and everything.

718
01:08:51,657 --> 01:08:57,484
And and he maybe he got tired and all... He he finally saw this thing come to this incredibly grand ending

719
01:08:57,825 --> 01:08:59,085
where the cities were buried,

720
01:08:59,425 --> 01:09:09,725
and this is how you wraps up. I I I I read it for the first time yesterday, in a long time, and I didn't remember the ending. And when I read I went, oh, well, that's convenient.

721
01:09:10,423 --> 01:09:22,320
But it works in the comedy world, if it works to bring that mystery keep the mystery alive if you will and keep the legend the alive. They'll never know again because there was never any reference to the seven cities of

722
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:41,120
Because they were only hunting Arrowhead in the big boys. I don't know. That was the biggest stretch for me. At least Inducks were already in the desert or part of the desert the biggest is we're just thrown out of the welfare office, and now they're sitting on a pile of rubble in Arizona. So I I don't know how they just that.

723
01:09:41,734 --> 01:09:59,530
Yeah. There's there's a lot of hand waving at the end of the story. So I I would say that's my only real criticism of this one. I otherwise think that this is maybe not an all time great, but, like a very strong, you know, second tier Barks

724
01:10:00,782 --> 01:10:01,921
Scrooge adventure.

725
01:10:02,299 --> 01:10:20,718
What what are your overall thoughts on this. Or yeah. I would agree with that that assessment, not at all time grade. But when it was paired with luck of the north and that that best of series back in the from sixty four to sixty seven when he did three three, gold three of those. Where they pair these stories that were similar

726
01:10:21,295 --> 01:10:28,786
adventure stories. It worked so well there because it was the first time I read it. Which stood out for me again was this this screws

727
01:10:29,123 --> 01:10:29,623
absolute

728
01:10:30,198 --> 01:10:31,296
forward more treasure

729
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:42,625
and and and the great track that he went on to get it. Everything from that first splash panel of him and the money been to that last flash panel of the rack just circulating and destroying everything.

730
01:10:43,159 --> 01:10:48,951
Those are the memories I have of this story. And that's why I have a fun recollection of it. Upon reading it again,

731
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:53,598
again, I put it in that you do describe it as the second tier. I think that's where it belongs.

732
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:54,716
So, yeah.

733
01:10:55,754 --> 01:11:04,315
Great artwork work. Again, beautiful storytelling, he kinda misses fact in fiction to do it to make it the Barks reality. And I think that it works. Yeah.

734
01:11:05,114 --> 01:11:09,730
Second here kind of as an overall story, but it might be a top tier

735
01:11:10,243 --> 01:11:12,913
story as far as the, like, treasure hunting.

736
01:11:13,431 --> 01:11:13,931
Storage.

737
01:11:14,428 --> 01:11:18,196
That vein, yes. And the fact that this is Scrooge is first time out

738
01:11:18,509 --> 01:11:31,556
makes it very special. Yeah. So I I like this one. I think it's a great story. It doesn't have kind of the, like, wait and and impact of some of the earlier screwed ones that are, like more

739
01:11:32,932 --> 01:11:33,432
interested

740
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:42,262
in some of those deeper things, like like poor man and Dyke, but... But it's just a great solid adventure

741
01:11:42,879 --> 01:11:45,652
Again, all of the different little twists and terms

742
01:11:46,203 --> 01:11:48,539
that it takes... They feel very earned

743
01:11:48,997 --> 01:11:52,330
to me. And and that mix of real

744
01:11:52,668 --> 01:11:53,926
history and legends

745
01:11:54,598 --> 01:11:55,237
and Barks

746
01:11:55,717 --> 01:12:09,998
creation is just so nicely balanced and everything is so nicely integrated. I love it. You get you get this great setup up it feels very true to sc, how he wants to try new fields to make money.

747
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:13,269
You get this fun little gyro gear loose

748
01:12:14,419 --> 01:12:59,301
cameo, you get... You hit the the sn w version of the beagle boys that that are very funny. I I like this one. It's it's a nostalgic favorite for me. One thing I noticed and and see if you agree, there was that one or two panels where the narrative, it is on page twenty where the ship is seen in the flood. It's a flash right of the earthquake for lands I think had there been more pages and had he given that. He may have introduced the more flash sequences lenses of the citizens of Si of maybe some of the... What they were doing. That might have been kind of a nice addition to the story. I was hoping for a little more of that. I see it here. Where the ship settles and then we go right back to reading the the lock book, but

749
01:12:59,878 --> 01:13:13,725
that's only one little minor this decision for me is I would have liked to have seen more of that flash to really set it up a little bit more Yeah. I would that would have been cool to see. I think I would have liked to have spent a little bit more time in.

750
01:13:15,242 --> 01:13:18,775
Itself. Mh. I think you right of a flash in.

751
01:13:19,168 --> 01:13:21,002
Could have been really interesting. But

752
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,615
See that with the cave wall paintings

753
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:32,598
that they they look at and it would been interesting to maybe see what the you know, and he's done this with others where he think he goes back in time to show that the

754
01:13:33,572 --> 01:13:38,399
how the culture evolved. Yeah. Yeah. So so let's check in with how

755
01:13:38,699 --> 01:13:56,732
how the community feels about this one. I I think I it's pretty much in line with how you and I have been just describing it. Right? If you look on Inducks, which, of course is the community site where anyone can vote on these stories and and it has lots of great facts and material about them.

756
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:00,822
It gets a seven point eight out of ten

757
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:09,131
which is good as of right now as of today. It's it's barely in the top one hundred. It is number one hundred

758
01:14:09,549 --> 01:14:10,744
right now at this moment.

759
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:16,659
Alright. That's a very strong ranking. When you consider that there are, like, forty two thousand stories

760
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:17,579
voted

761
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,019
by that fans have voted on

762
01:14:20,652 --> 01:14:22,347
on index. And

763
01:14:23,122 --> 01:14:24,618
I feel like it's

764
01:14:25,035 --> 01:14:26,173
I feel

765
01:14:26,868 --> 01:14:36,489
like it's a pretty accurate ranking. I'll say that I think that it is one of the... For me, if I think about those first ten issues of Scrooge,

766
01:14:36,943 --> 01:14:37,183
Mh.

767
01:14:37,942 --> 01:14:41,697
Which is just kinda useful. It's a nice round number. Right? And there's like,

768
01:14:42,656 --> 01:14:43,015
there's like,

769
01:14:44,588 --> 01:14:45,088
four

770
01:14:45,507 --> 01:14:46,007
stand

771
01:14:46,746 --> 01:14:47,446
that are

772
01:14:48,064 --> 01:14:51,261
one, two, three and six. Yes.

773
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:53,059
Pearl man

774
01:14:53,579 --> 01:14:53,933
Dyke

775
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:56,167
horse rad story

776
01:14:56,663 --> 01:14:57,221
t Al.

777
01:14:57,939 --> 01:14:59,873
And and then Secret of Lan

778
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:09,198
is again, it's more of a pure adventure story. It doesn't have the like. The them asymptomatic kind of maturity that those other

779
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:23,098
three do. Those that those other four you. Yeah. But it's just such a great adventure that those are kind of the the those five stories. Are the best of that run. This great run that he has.

780
01:15:23,438 --> 01:15:24,418
Yeah. He was really

781
01:15:24,758 --> 01:15:31,218
in his stride there Yeah. And And so, like but to me, this one is probably

782
01:15:32,114 --> 01:15:33,747
apart from the secret of.

783
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:47,736
This is the best of the just like adventure stories. Yes. In that first run. And again, there's no reason to consider the first ten stories other than the... They are the first ten stories. Right.

784
01:15:48,774 --> 01:15:54,638
But... But I I like this one. I might even rank it a little bit higher, like, I think

785
01:15:54,978 --> 01:15:56,158
le with the locket

786
01:15:56,738 --> 01:15:57,238
and

787
01:15:57,978 --> 01:15:59,738
fabulous philosopher Gladstone,

788
01:15:59,898 --> 01:16:06,405
I think they might be ranked higher than this one is Inducks. And And for me, this one works better. This one hits

789
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:23,498
this one hits better. I like this one better than mysterious stone right for sure. Which I think is also ranked quite a bit higher. Okay? Well, again, the three... The three reasons I like this story, I grew up with it. It was in the first common I bought. It was paired with my favorite story like of the north.

790
01:16:24,057 --> 01:16:30,984
Number two, the splash panels in just embedded in my memory. And and and just I love

791
01:16:31,298 --> 01:16:39,018
the storytelling technique and the the fact that this was Al adventure. And then later, my third reason is that it inspired George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.

792
01:16:39,473 --> 01:16:44,213
Two of my favorite phone filmmakers and great story tellers in their own right. To

793
01:16:44,593 --> 01:16:50,879
to continue on with that and back the they, they saw Barks as a wonderful story and Al inspiration.

794
01:16:51,438 --> 01:16:54,731
Says a whole lot about about Carl Barks. Yeah. Well.

795
01:16:55,762 --> 01:16:56,502
I think

796
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,177
I think this clearly

797
01:16:58,754 --> 01:17:02,504
inspired. A lot of people who came out with some pretty great stuff.

798
01:17:03,317 --> 01:17:07,250
So as far as other media goes,

799
01:17:08,427 --> 01:17:10,244
one, do you

800
01:17:10,662 --> 01:17:11,162
own

801
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:14,767
this lit itself? I do. I do. It's

802
01:17:15,103 --> 01:17:27,038
it's good. I wouldn't call it great because it's a... You have a picture of it, Are you looking at it? Yeah I'm not right now, but I'm I'm know well familiar with this. Yeah. It I I I think I would liked to seen more of the adventure

803
01:17:27,538 --> 01:17:28,398
in the little

804
01:17:28,912 --> 01:17:32,501
This one features them, I think, with the idle, if I'm not mistaken,

805
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:36,152
and it it it kinda sets it up, but they're all very happy to

806
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:44,958
see the treasures of si. But yes, I have that one. It's it's a beautiful one. The colors are incredible. Yeah. I really like this one. I I

807
01:17:45,793 --> 01:17:47,848
This one always struck me. So...

808
01:17:48,225 --> 01:17:56,037
Yeah. I and as far as I know, this is not one that have had... This story doesn't have any big sequel.

809
01:17:56,533 --> 01:18:02,850
And then I don't believe that it was ever adapted into a Ducktales story. I was gonna

810
01:18:03,162 --> 01:18:07,411
it is kind of, you know, reminiscent to me of the pilot

811
01:18:08,387 --> 01:18:12,774
episodes where Scrooge is looking for some golden cities.

812
01:18:13,507 --> 01:18:17,639
So I think they might have kind of adapted the spirit of this story,

813
01:18:17,977 --> 01:18:22,403
but I don't think they're like... I don't think they ever specifically call out seven cities and

814
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:23,919
or anything.

815
01:18:24,535 --> 01:18:33,699
What I found interesting was that this story came out in nineteen fifty four. Correct? And then I? Yeah. The nineteen fifty five out of Hollywood came

816
01:18:34,635 --> 01:18:43,486
adventure film called the seven cities of gold and then in nineteen fifty eight, just a few years later, there was the classic Clayton moore gold... Loan ranger

817
01:18:44,103 --> 01:18:47,676
in the city of gold. Again, all based on this this

818
01:18:48,866 --> 01:19:02,754
story of of the seven cities of Yeah. This this legend really does cast long shadow. Excellent. I think we've covered it pretty well. And. Are there any favorite panels that you'd would like to highlight?

819
01:19:03,128 --> 01:19:16,923
Well I'm gonna go back to the the... What I called the three big splash panels. The first one and the money Bin, which just to me is just makes me smile and I love money been opening shots. You mentioned that it brings the new readers back into who uncle Scrooge is,

820
01:19:17,603 --> 01:19:19,799
and those the first when they see

821
01:19:20,218 --> 01:19:31,044
and when the boulder hits. Those are my favorite big splash panels, but I I think some of the other panels that just I just can't get enough of our with the big boys when they're thrown out of the welfare for office.

822
01:19:31,502 --> 01:19:35,334
And when they when they all march off together in in defeat,

823
01:19:36,069 --> 01:19:44,729
with their arms on their shoulders. And then when they appear as they case the doors and surprise Scrooge, I just love that. Yeah. You listed some good ones there. The

824
01:19:45,761 --> 01:19:49,908
almost required by law to mention those great splash panels. Yeah.

825
01:19:51,942 --> 01:19:53,797
As far as others,

826
01:19:54,135 --> 01:19:55,808
I I did like

827
01:19:56,149 --> 01:19:57,208
the panel

828
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:59,248
of the ship.

829
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:00,529
In the flash.

830
01:20:01,228 --> 01:20:20,838
Yes. I mean, all of the panels of the ship, but especially the flood, it it feels like it should have been a splash panel. Oh, yeah. It could it easily been. And, again, that's why I wanted more more of that backstory because it would just so romantic and it's per trail and just so adventurous. Yeah. And and honestly, like, the the Ducktales whole journey,

831
01:20:21,792 --> 01:20:25,006
just feels very very impactful and very cool.

832
01:20:25,703 --> 01:20:33,533
You mentioned those beagle boys at the beginning. Those are all very funny panels. I mean, this one's full of very nice panels in general.

833
01:20:34,331 --> 01:20:37,360
I do like when when Scrooge is re recoil,

834
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:38,433
at

835
01:20:38,814 --> 01:20:42,154
the peanut guy telling him that this

836
01:20:43,053 --> 01:20:45,853
this peanut wagon already belongs to you to you. Yeah. Yeah.

837
01:20:46,627 --> 01:20:50,635
And of course, this the scene the the short scene with Jay Is,

838
01:20:51,013 --> 01:21:12,040
you know, asking him... Are you Scrooge I your prescription back I made to on, you know? My old hotel doesn't recognize me. And then I I was wondering if the big boys ever wore those outfits again. I don't recall the white shirt and the blue pants. I don't know if that's the original color. I do have... I do have Scrooge number seven the dell. So I'm gonna go take a look at the color reference. It's probably pretty accurate.

839
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:17,214
Yeah. I think I think they're still sporting that in the next

840
01:21:17,954 --> 01:21:19,214
I mean this a good segue

841
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:20,174
to

842
01:21:20,968 --> 01:21:28,862
telling listeners to please join us for for the next episode when we get to cover the mysterious stone ray. Mh.

843
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:35,161
I think that they're still dressed like that in this one in that one, but

844
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:37,454
but I'm not gonna fact check it.

845
01:21:39,349 --> 01:21:39,849
So,

846
01:21:40,269 --> 01:21:49,978
yeah, Any any closing thoughts one? Just a just a fun adventure story. Knowing that that that... I think Carl Barks probably felt that now into his seventh

847
01:21:50,397 --> 01:21:50,897
issue

848
01:21:51,476 --> 01:21:58,118
of of Scrooge title he was hitting his stride with really fully developing Scrooge into an adventure a treasure hunter.

849
01:21:58,916 --> 01:22:04,458
Now he could do anything. And I think this is really setting up Scrooge for the reader who

850
01:22:04,915 --> 01:22:08,247
I was reading in one of the essay sa that I read online that

851
01:22:08,983 --> 01:22:20,600
a come from a reader just said Scrooge is my favorite superhero. I thought that pretty cool because liquid doing it is age and he's doing this stuff with, you know, all all this action.

852
01:22:20,934 --> 01:22:27,154
So I thought that was a pretty cool complement to Pay Barks and to pay on Scrooge. Yeah. Barks is really showing a lot of confidence

853
01:22:27,494 --> 01:22:29,824
at this point. Excellent. Alright. Well,

854
01:22:30,582 --> 01:22:33,794
listeners feel free to reach out on

855
01:22:34,331 --> 01:22:38,861
the socials. You know, we've got Barks remarks on Facebook and Instagram.

856
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:40,759
And warren,

857
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:44,675
if you don't mind, I've been closing out recent

858
01:22:45,149 --> 01:22:48,609
those by asking guests to just read whatever

859
01:22:48,989 --> 01:22:54,243
is in the last panel. Alright. So the last panel of the seven cities of.

860
01:22:55,082 --> 01:23:06,459
Screws walks off and says, well, let them go. I'm too tired to dig back under that pile of rubble for two bucks. Awesome. Thanks so much, Warren. This is a lot of fun. Thank you, Mark.
