00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:25,185
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of sc Mc Ducktales and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge con of all time

2
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:32,175
This episode is a ten page podcast all about one of his short stories, get ready to enjoy our remarks.

3
00:00:33,148 --> 00:00:38,677
Welcome back to Barks remarks. We have another episode of the ten page podcast.

4
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:44,156
We're gonna be talking about a great ten pager from nineteen forty nine,

5
00:00:44,572 --> 00:00:53,610
and I've i've got my returning guest here. Can you introduce yourself? This is Ryan Bailey. I'm the newcomer two duck comics.

6
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,683
Actually so less so with each passing episode. Yeah. That's right.

7
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:14,391
I'm I'm glad you've gotten to read couple of these ten pager now, a few of the ten pager as well as a good chunk of adventure stories. And I I don't know if it's enough to compare, but do you have kind of a feel for, you know, the difference between those two different

8
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:15,205
creatures.

9
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,705
Probably just the first hints of it.

10
00:01:18,385 --> 00:01:25,058
Yeah. I think we've gotten to read super snoop. This one, which I'll mention is the sunken yacht.

11
00:01:25,797 --> 00:01:29,013
And then, you know, you read Donald Ducktales At.

12
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:35,265
Yeah. Yeah. The fire was kinda spiritually a ten pager it was a few pages longer. So... Okay.

13
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:38,305
Yeah. That... That's some... That's a little bit of grounding.

14
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:40,645
So We'll have to have you back for a couple more of them.

15
00:01:41,338 --> 00:01:45,147
This this is really fun one. Right? Because this is one of a very

16
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:50,092
small number of Carl Barks stories that's gonna have some pop culture

17
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:52,585
connections. This one is is

18
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:54,985
actually fairly well known

19
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:58,485
outside of Disney comics fandom.

20
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:03,555
Ryan are you a a fan of Myth busters? I am a fan lu. I used to watch them all the time

21
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:07,230
back in the day. Excellent. Yeah. So we'll we'll get into it, but this

22
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,281
this story was actually featured in an episode of myth busters.

23
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,455
And, you know, it just... It comes up here and there. It's it's appeared in in other reference.

24
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:29,969
I'm gonna I'm gonna talk just a little bit about the background of this one. And and as usual for the ten page podcast podcasts these are a little bit less researched. Feel free to point out my mistakes.

25
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:30,885
And

26
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:32,717
I will

27
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,330
politely listen and then move on.

28
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,950
There's the least you could do after after we spend all this time pointing out any of karl Barks mistakes.

29
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:42,302
Right.

30
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:57,122
So again, the sun yacht is a ten pager that was first published in walt Disney's comics and stories, so probably at that time Walt Disney's comics, number one hundred and four. This one is in

31
00:02:57,581 --> 00:03:05,236
nineteen Published nineteen forty nine, so it's pretty conte with the adventure length stories that I've been doing right now. And...

32
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,200
So was he... Was he starting off with

33
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:15,937
shorter ones and then expand it to the longer ones later. So he was pretty much doing them side by side. You got to be

34
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:17,971
on for the first

35
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:23,528
story that he did that was an adventure length on all on his own, which was the mummy

36
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:41,645
ring. But as soon as he was brought on, like, to work on the these full time. He would pretty much do an adventure story two to three times a year. And then in between, he would be doing a bunch of ten pager. And that was pretty consistent. Throughout his career. So he... He's really... He's cranking these stories out.

37
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:50,891
I don't remember the exact count, but you know, it's it's in the neighborhood of five hundred, you know, these ten pager and maybe a hundred or so.

38
00:03:51,425 --> 00:04:09,430
Of of the event showing story. So he these are really kind of his bread and butter. Yeah. And and this one stands out because it's a little bit more adventurous, maybe than the average one, you know, there's there's never any real mortal danger, but it's it's a pretty exciting story. Yeah. And so

39
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:12,596
let's get into it. The the sunken yacht,

40
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:18,175
oh and, you know, I shouldn't note too that these titles for the ten pager. They were generally un.

41
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:20,330
So this is kind of like a

42
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,405
an after the fact

43
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:24,001
tit that was

44
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:33,667
kind of agreed generally agreed upon by fans who wanted to track the stories. So, you know, some of them, some of them have these really great

45
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,380
clever titles and some of them are just kind of... This is what the story is about.

46
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,575
But I assume I assume once they're, you know, in collections and stuff later, they they get kind of officially

47
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:45,495
named.

48
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,455
Right? Yeah. Exactly. Like, the the official names,

49
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:57,110
you know, it's kind of what the fans landed on. And And here and there, you'll see a little bit of variation even in the publications.

50
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,804
And this is all for the English, of course. And

51
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:13,370
and then at some point, it gets cod. So so this one's been the the sun yacht. I don't know how for how long. This is... Oh, you know the the notable thing about this too is that this is one of the earliest...

52
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,820
We're still in that new character mode for uncle Scrooge Mc. Right?

53
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:25,220
You you were here for his introduction in Christmas on Bear mountain. This is not

54
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:37,302
that long after that took place. And and then it's he's had, like, three or four appearances in the adventure length stories right now. So Scrooge is very much a work in progress.

55
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,975
So Ryan, why don't we... Why don't we kinda save some of the

56
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:48,182
like myth busters and other pop culture stuff or after we talk about the actual

57
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,389
story. Yep. Alright. So the sun yacht,

58
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:57,900
it opens very similarly, I would say to the way that goes to the g story that you and I uncovered

59
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,740
opens up the docs just in progress with

60
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:13,574
some some work that they're doing on the c. Barks really enjoyed showing these characters working at sea. They're there basically Scrooge salvage, you know, recovering anchors and

61
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:15,945
stuff from sunken ships.

62
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:27,303
And at the seabed bed. And you know, they're talking about how it's it's dependable work it's not that lucrative, but they seem to be doing right. And as they're heading back to shore,

63
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,979
they spy a

64
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:47,497
rack a ship rack down at the bottom of the seabed bed, and the Ducktales peer over. And, you know, they they see that it's a small yacht that has a hole in the side that must have sunk recently and they kinda speculate that they could be equipped to tackle a job of that size. Yeah. I noticed

65
00:06:48,114 --> 00:06:53,900
I feel like we're getting, like, capable donald in this one. Because once the kids speculate on it,

66
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,860
he pulls out a pencil and starts running some figures on the on the side of the the main

67
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:03,188
cockpit or whatever you would call that, the main cabin of the of the boat.

68
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:10,827
And he seems like a a sensible business owner. Yeah. That's right. You know, he he and the nephews user are very, like, collaborative and very sharp.

69
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:23,865
He's very much, like, figured out. Thank you for talking and I like to talk about what version of the sort of every man donald we get. So on the next page, you know, as you said, they kinda... He kinda does some figuring.

70
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:25,265
He decides

71
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:53,929
He seems to be doing really some business planning, you know, figuring out what it would cost to raise it and what kind of profit that would leave them. And so they decide they're gonna go for it. And you know, I really like this little part of the story. It may be a small thing, but it's neat seeing some of the sort of, like business ends of how you would go about doing this. Right? And it feels very authentic. The Ducktales leave a small boo over the rack to signal that, you know, they're intending

72
00:07:54,346 --> 00:08:01,365
to to raise it. They go to the Harbor masters office, they look up the registry for the ship to figure out who owns it.

73
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:04,510
It just... It feels very

74
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:10,683
like he really took the time to understand how this would work. Where or at least did a good job of loving it.

75
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:22,620
And and they discover the the registry says that it belongs to their own uncle, the ty Scrooge Mc And so Donald is like, oh, wow. The price has

76
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:29,701
has just jumped and, you know, this being a new version of Scrooge, he he clearly doesn't know Scrooge that well yet.

77
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:43,803
Yeah. Also, the book is roughly the same size as Donald. I think in scale and scale size, it would be like a five foot tall book. And once again, I can't tell if this is cartoon ish exaggeration. Or if this is an accurate

78
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:54,650
representation of the nineteen forties. If you could go to look at a registry of ships and it would be some gigantic book listing the names and contact information of everybody who owns all the different boats.

79
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:00,100
Right. And I guess it's worth noting that the the yacht is named the Last ceo o.

80
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:14,495
And I there may be a reference in there, but I did not look it up. Because again, ten page podcast. I'm I'm cutting myself a little research break. So listener wants to let us know what what it means to be the Gladstone

81
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:21,567
dune. Usually, Barks would probably throw in some some funny clever name. But that sounds like it could be a real ship. I took it as a

82
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,083
reinforcement that

83
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:24,457
hey,

84
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:27,664
Readers, Uncle Sc very scottish. Yes.

85
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,701
I show Scottish. Yes. Yes.

86
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,397
And the the nephews referred to him as the richest man in the world. Was he already that in

87
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:40,766
Christmas on Bear Mountain or was that added here? So I don't think he was referred...

88
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:45,041
Yeah. Yeah that's that's a little bit of fact checking there for the ten p box.

89
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,412
Sorry. That's alright. And now

90
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:52,317
hit me with it. I... I'm gonna say he wasn't yet, but I think

91
00:09:52,854 --> 00:10:03,272
by his, like, third adventure story erased to the south sees, he might have been, you know, correct me everyone. Alright. So, you know, we transitioned to Donald going to

92
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:08,845
propose raising the yacht. To his uncle Scrooge and he reads him very familiar.

93
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:09,885
High

94
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:10,725
gunk.

95
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:12,525
And,

96
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:18,653
you know, he proposes to he's gonna raise it for the sum of fifty thousand dollars.

97
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:24,281
And, you know, Scrooge is insulted. This is clearly a high vol offer

98
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,415
It is way too much.

99
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:27,375
And

100
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:39,303
by the next page, he he's given him the low ball offer of two thousand dollars. Right? So this this tells me that Sc already knows he's very sharp. Right? He knows what it's gonna take

101
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:44,849
to raise the ship and he's not even baking any profit into that. And and, you know,

102
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,707
they come

103
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:51,674
to that their cow at each other. They're they're immediately upset Al each other.

104
00:10:52,331 --> 00:11:03,675
Scrooge tells him he didn't become the world's richest man by being dumb, and he tells them to take it or leave it. Donald decides to leave it. And, you know, this leaves Scrooge just

105
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:07,890
stew and he wants to show up Donald And so he

106
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,530
approaches his clerk

107
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:34,044
and he kinda has a list of tasks for the clerk, and he's clearly putting plan into place, he put some money into a lock Barks, and and we'll see what happens with that in a moment. Any any comments about this sequence or this, you know, version of Scrooge? At this point, it does seem consistent with even the like Mickey east Christmas carol kind of just grumpy a guy. He's literally sitting at a desk counting his money. When

108
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:41,445
Don locks in with his high An donkey. Yeah. But... Yeah. And and then also, I mean, fifty thousand dollars even in twenty first century dollars.

109
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,700
You could buy a a pretty decent boat.

110
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,320
Right. Fifty grand,

111
00:11:48,140 --> 00:12:00,512
that's that's a pretty crazy amount of money. I mean, that's gotta be more than a million dollars in in present present day money just to like bring up someone's boat. He just figures Uncle Scrooge is made of money, i'll just give him a number. He doesn't know what's what anyway. He is no, you know,

112
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,805
it's just a banana mark. What could it cost ten dollars?

113
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:05,420
Exactly.

114
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:15,542
Yeah. And and this is... You, it's it's obviously some cartoon logic, but if if you wanted to over analyze it, and this is a podcast so we do.

115
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:23,527
I'd point out that, you know, Donald made a big mistake here by if he... I'm guessing if he'd had a reasonable

116
00:12:24,383 --> 00:12:24,861
proposal,

117
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:30,067
sp might have been amenable to it, and, you know, then Scrooge just

118
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,520
could off enough that he

119
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,840
isn't even willing to bake in any profit. So they they just got off on the wrong foot, basically.

120
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:43,241
And, you know, it it leads us to to some classic hi. So

121
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:47,986
the next sequence has Donald receiving a a delivery

122
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,120
Before we move on to Donald, I want to show

123
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,400
sc walking out to his secretary.

124
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:00,799
His secretary is sitting at a desk in front of a chart. There's nothing on the chart except just Al line rocket upwards.

125
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:01,376
Yeah.

126
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:05,026
Presumably representing uncle Sc

127
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:16,654
rapidly recognizing fortunes. And then there are figures written on the front of the desk. U. Similar to the way Donald was writing figures on the cabin of his ship, and it has... That would be

128
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:26,157
two trillion plus seven point six trillion equals nine point six trillion, and then a different problem says seventeen trillion plus eighteen billion equals thirty five what.

129
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:36,972
Yeah. Thank you for pointing that out. So that it's there can be no question that Uncle Scrooge certainly the richest man, that's probably more than the value of the entire planet

130
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:38,566
is

131
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:59,850
Jeff Bezos in two hundred years. That's right. And and even even the non made up figures there are like, more than the G of the Us at that time. Right. So I... You know, you were with me for super snoop. We recorded that one now. That might come out after this one actually, but I like that we have another of these

132
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,170
quote messenger boys

133
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,230
that is like an old man.

134
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:14,358
I I think this is kind of a running gag that he does in a lot of these that that today's audience might not pick up on. But he just loves to use old man as telegram.

135
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:18,330
Yeah. And so Donald getting a

136
00:14:18,748 --> 00:14:28,810
delivery package from the law firm of squeeze fleece some skin skip. This is an old joke, but I... I'm I'm guessing it wasn't quite as old at this time.

137
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:35,449
The Ducktales open it to find that it is a... It's the lock box that we saw Scrooge

138
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:44,386
getting ready to send, and it's got a note that says the box contains a thousand dollars left to you by your late uncle Mar

139
00:14:44,724 --> 00:14:45,203
Mall.

140
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:52,221
And, you know, Donald mentioned, he's never heard of him just to he previously never heard of the law firm. And

141
00:14:52,877 --> 00:15:14,642
he he learns that, you know, he can only earn this money if he earns this similar thousand dollars within five days. And so, you know, the this is kinda one of those classic setups where a character has a chance to make a windfall, but they have to they have to make a similar amount, you know a, limited period of time. And I think a lot of

142
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:18,735
creators, Ryan have used this trope to to

143
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:20,055
get characters

144
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:20,935
moving

145
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:23,215
and give that sense of urgency

146
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:28,404
to, you know, put them in positions that they otherwise wouldn't. Yeah. Yeah.

147
00:15:29,323 --> 00:15:31,102
Yeah. This exchange reminded me of

148
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:40,136
when I got Al listed email that someone has a banker check for me in the amount of twelve million dollars. And all I need to do is

149
00:15:40,728 --> 00:15:42,825
write them a check for the processing fee,

150
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:44,222
and

151
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,830
they'll send me the money. It's completely... The legitimate make, obviously,

152
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:55,650
as as Donald Can tell. Yeah. I... I mean, what are you doing on this podcast? It sounds like you've got...

153
00:15:56,068 --> 00:16:01,060
I am extremely rich out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm very glad I better get to it.

154
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:21,550
So the Ducktales are, you know, agonizing over, you know, how are they gonna make this kind of money. And so Donald heads up town to see if he can figure it out. And we've got uncle Scrooge stalking in the background basically telegraph to the readers that he's determined to sabotage him. And and we're about to get this sequence where

155
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:24,437
these these money making

156
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,390
opportunities just

157
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:33,342
throw themselves donald for for comic effect. It's it's super unrealistic, but it's it's quite funny.

158
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:38,127
And so Ryan, would you like to describe his his first

159
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:41,810
money making opportunity that just leaps out at him.

160
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:44,441
So a

161
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:46,833
stereotype of a French artist

162
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,069
with a

163
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:57,941
Mustache of who's the melting clock guy? Oh, yeah. Dolly. Right? Yes. So he looks like Salvador Dolly

164
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:10,213
with Al little on and I realized i'll it was not french. And then he has a Al in one hand and a little a little bow Bow tie and the asthma mach. And he he's going to pay Donald

165
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,505
fifty dollars an hour to pose

166
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:13,742
for his painting,

167
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,657
man of Z sub order.

168
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:17,730
Right. Because

169
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:19,964
because Donald is a pinnacle of humanity.

170
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,175
And, of course, Uncle Scrooge

171
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:23,289
the...

172
00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:24,486
Whatever

173
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,405
has nothing better to do than to be following him around and trying to foil his

174
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,158
money making out of just sheer spite.

175
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah. So he's he's gonna sabotage Donald need to stand still in this

176
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:41,916
caveman Man pose

177
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,648
with a box of each powder.

178
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:55,185
And so he just... I don't know if you're familiar with it powder. Ryan like sold as a novelty at joke shops and stuff you really only need a pinch true too for it to do it stuff.

179
00:17:55,719 --> 00:18:02,670
Keep. I did see... I did see some warner brothers cartoons growing up, but i saw some some bugs bunny and all of that. And this was along with the Al

180
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:07,894
know, is one of many chemicals that I'm only familiar with in in its cartoon to form.

181
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:15,620
Yeah. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I actually ordered this. One time from the, like, novelty company, Johnson and Johnson. And

182
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,633
but... yeah. He just... He just dumps the whole box of each powder on him and, you know, predictably

183
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:26,307
donald sq and itch and and loses his pushy posing

184
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:27,265
gig

185
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:29,594
and just puzzles over

186
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:33,222
what what suddenly came into him to make him so itchy.

187
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:36,212
And so we transition

188
00:18:36,604 --> 00:18:38,380
to the next sequence.

189
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:41,251
Do you mind describe that one for us. Ryan?

190
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:49,062
So he happens to walk by sign at Joe's Jim that says boxer wanted to spa with the champ, fifty dollars a minute.

191
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:54,085
And that's some decent money. So he responds with

192
00:18:54,703 --> 00:18:57,736
what All ducks say when they get excited. Black? Mh.

193
00:18:58,135 --> 00:19:02,480
Yep. And, you know, these opportunities are getting better and better. So he

194
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:07,111
he jumps into the ring and and this guy, this guy absolutely

195
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:08,428
what Without

196
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:11,781
him because it's just this big hulk

197
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:13,632
gorilla of a man.

198
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:18,101
But is, like ne phase two to add to his...

199
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:22,744
Right. Persona. This guy would have been great to pose for that french.

200
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,300
Yes.

201
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:27,550
I didn't even think of that. That's perfect.

202
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:34,046
So so the champ sizes up Donald, you like. Alright. I'll I'll I'll do what I can. And,

203
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:40,926
you know, uncle sc just gonna sabotage this in in a manner that should definitely get him put in jail.

204
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:42,763
He sneaks a horseshoe

205
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,295
into the man's boxing glove

206
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:51,063
and it's it's just lights out with a single hay or upper cut.

207
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:52,321
And of course

208
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:56,010
Donald is instantly killed. And and

209
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,210
the nephew more his loss and

210
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,650
then their orphan out on the streets right.

211
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,450
No. Also,

212
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:22,631
You know, when you're putting on a boxing glove, you can't have it just like, it's not like putting on a a writing glove or like, an oven mitt or something like that. You actually have to, like, tie it on you have to have someone probably tie on the other one. It's tight against your wrist so that it's not just flying off as you're swinging your arms around. You can't just

213
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:28,725
walk up and slide a gigantic into to iron horse you into it, much less without the person noticing.

214
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:33,574
Right. Yeah. The the champs probably use to his crooked manager

215
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:38,752
slipping stuff in, you know, some problem it's probably true. Oh, I guess

216
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:47,025
Guess have do something to get out of paying a thousand dollars to some jump for lasting twenty minutes. You gotta be like, here's your here's your five bucks for your six seconds that you last.

217
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,099
Right.

218
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:56,260
So so Donald is not in fact in a coffin. He he wake up. He comes to four days later,

219
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:59,048
He's been unconscious

220
00:20:59,585 --> 00:21:00,085
since

221
00:21:00,502 --> 00:21:05,645
since he was knocked out. Honestly, his first stop should definitely be to the doctor's office.

222
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,517
But, you know, he's focused on the fact that he's...

223
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:12,693
The the time period is almost up.

224
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:17,481
And he only has a single day left to earn the thousand bucks.

225
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:22,306
So, you know, he's he's feeling desperate at this point.

226
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:25,337
He runs out of his house looking for anything.

227
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:31,824
He he immediately sees uncle sc who smiles knowing lee. What do we think Ryan

228
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:34,501
just been pacing out there for the last

229
00:21:35,535 --> 00:21:37,355
anything thing for Donald to come to.

230
00:21:37,735 --> 00:21:39,635
His spike truly knows no limits.

231
00:21:40,095 --> 00:21:40,955
That's right.

232
00:21:42,255 --> 00:21:44,375
Yeah. And I I didn't really mention we've thought.

233
00:21:45,188 --> 00:21:49,437
Pretty much the version of Sp were used to minus his top hat. Right?

234
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:53,425
He's not wearing his his like red

235
00:21:53,882 --> 00:22:02,395
broad cloth I think is is the term for the the garment he usually wears. He's got his spat. He's got his cane. He's got his pension as

236
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:04,446
Spectacle

237
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:05,644
and his...

238
00:22:06,022 --> 00:22:20,185
His whisk are a little bit bush here, but... But we're we're pretty close to the version of Sp. We've got definitely and i I think of them as like mutton chops. It seems like what an old Scottish guy in the forties would have yeah. Yeah. That... That's that's what they look like here.

239
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:26,168
So anyway, he he knows at least he's got this opportunity to raise the yacht

240
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:28,802
pretty much Al cost. So

241
00:22:29,754 --> 00:22:32,787
as sc intended, he takes some up on the offer.

242
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:33,965
And

243
00:22:34,582 --> 00:22:36,120
we transitioned to the ducks

244
00:22:36,457 --> 00:22:38,908
getting ready to raise the yacht,

245
00:22:39,307 --> 00:22:40,287
sc just kinda

246
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:42,763
with light. And

247
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:44,042
and

248
00:22:45,354 --> 00:22:52,855
we have this fun sequence now where they're gonna go around to rent the necessary equipment to do the the salvage operation.

249
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:54,009
But

250
00:22:54,466 --> 00:23:00,988
everyone they talked to tells them that the price has been set at three thousand dollars a day

251
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:02,862
per

252
00:23:03,255 --> 00:23:06,475
her instructions of the owner, Ty Scrooge Mc.

253
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:12,535
And the Ducktales, you know, they immediately su out what sc is doing. He's trying to kinda put the screws on them.

254
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:18,690
And have them do it for his cost. They they come up cold because

255
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,784
Scrooge has his tentacles and everything. Right? Yeah. Yeah.

256
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:26,159
So they have a sequence of a few places they go.

257
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:29,035
The first the first guy that they were going to go to.

258
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,790
The pontoon and pump boat

259
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,270
is owned by sc, and then a big Derrick barge is owned by sc,

260
00:23:37,505 --> 00:23:40,005
watching someone play Ping pong they get the next idea.

261
00:23:40,425 --> 00:23:47,779
Yeah. And this is this is where the story kinda takes its memorable turn. Right? This is what everyone remembers about this. And nephews,

262
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:50,650
see this little ping pong match,

263
00:23:51,027 --> 00:23:58,045
and they get the great idea that they can float the barge that they can float the yacht with ping pong balls.

264
00:23:58,825 --> 00:24:02,925
And Donald got the the natural response. No.

265
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:11,013
But, you know, he's he's desperate and and he thinks about it. Seems like a great idea. So they're gonna...

266
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:12,591
They're gonna give it a try.

267
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:17,225
And we transition to the ducks hard at work.

268
00:24:17,565 --> 00:24:19,905
Ryan do you mind describing kind of the process

269
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,440
So

270
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,480
Donald get the diving suit and he's down at the bottom with the tube.

271
00:24:28,194 --> 00:24:32,630
While the nephews are up top with, like, like a funnel and, like, a Ram rod,

272
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:36,626
and they're just dumping box after box of ping pong balls.

273
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,540
Bigger than they are.

274
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,715
The boxes are bigger than they are. And they're just ram them into the chute well Donald kind of points the shoot into the

275
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:54,167
the open hull of the ship and it kind of rises up out of the mud and pulls up and floats on top of the water. Yeah.

276
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:57,119
Yeah. So it's worked. It's worked fantastically,

277
00:24:57,778 --> 00:25:00,834
really beautiful panel, I think of the ship emerging,

278
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:06,522
the water cascading off, and they celebrate. They sing y and a bottle of ping pong balls.

279
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:08,840
And, you know, Donald

280
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,615
approaches sp who's at the dots and tells them he's gotta pay up.

281
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:17,454
And, you know, Uncle Scrooge signs the check for two thousand dollars.

282
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:25,311
For the job done without any fuss, he comments that it's the first time in his life, he ever paid a bill without being sued.

283
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:34,000
So you know, this version of Scrooge is is definitely a little bit s than the kind of default that Barks is gonna land on.

284
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:50,496
And so they they race home to get that lock box. There's a little bit of hand waving about not bothering to wait for the lawyers, because, you know, they know that they've they know that they've met the terms Do you mind Ryan telling us about what they what they find upon opening it?

285
00:25:51,575 --> 00:25:58,003
So they crack it open, and there's actually a thousand dollars in there, which is Al slightly surprise. Yeah.

286
00:25:58,542 --> 00:25:59,801
And it says, here's

287
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:03,256
one thousand dollars. Thanks for raising my yacht. Uncle Dumb Scrooge

288
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:08,045
Yeah. And and so they they puzzle this over because, you know, Scrooge just

289
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:11,535
done what he's said. Even though they didn't know it was him

290
00:26:12,313 --> 00:26:16,084
He's paid up. They've got their three thousand dollars. They don't really know

291
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:18,496
what the other shoe dropping is gonna be.

292
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,250
But then we get another of those

293
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,850
suspiciously old

294
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,530
telegram boys

295
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,410
delivering

296
00:26:26,124 --> 00:26:28,856
delivering a bill for you bob, He says

297
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,526
for three thousand dollars

298
00:26:32,142 --> 00:26:37,050
from the bouncy ball company, for a fantastic number of ping pong balls.

299
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,770
I love that. I love that Al little bit of dialogue.

300
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,170
It's great.

301
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,550
The ducks process.

302
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:49,730
Okay. That's you know, this this this is awful. This is everything we just made is is already taken

303
00:26:50,148 --> 00:26:50,648
and

304
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:59,180
one of the Nephews has a hunch and he he asks the delivery boy to confirm who who owns the bouncy ball company

305
00:27:00,055 --> 00:27:01,815
And who who is it Ryan?

306
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,775
It's Sc mc duck, Banker, Industrial, Magna and Ty.

307
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:08,289
So,

308
00:27:08,786 --> 00:27:12,679
yeah. So resourceful donald and his ind nephews,

309
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:15,971
they they come out on the bottom uncle Scrooge

310
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:19,285
wins out and we leave them

311
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:24,965
hauling old boots over the side of their of their boat having transitioned

312
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:27,178
to to another day.

313
00:27:27,557 --> 00:27:30,853
And... Also on this page, I only noticed on the second read

314
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:32,091
this

315
00:27:33,645 --> 00:27:36,265
Portrait on the wall, it looks like Donald face.

316
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:37,305
Just

317
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:47,783
just sc and fury and zoom so far into his face that you can't anything else in the picture. It's just one eye and about half his week. And and just just his sn angry eyebrows and

318
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,592
I have no idea, like, what the context is for that.

319
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,550
What that's supposed to represent.

320
00:27:53,969 --> 00:27:57,526
It's such a weird random piece of artwork for him to insert into the background.

321
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:04,138
It is. And the only the only comment I can add is that Parks has a lot of these, like randomly

322
00:28:04,673 --> 00:28:05,173
sc

323
00:28:05,805 --> 00:28:07,703
pieces of feel artwork work.

324
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:19,976
Maybe maybe at the bark household, there's just portraits of his sc eyes on the walls. So his kids could be like, should I do something that I'm not allowed to do and they kind of glance up and go oh, dad. Oh, sorry. No. I'm not gonna...

325
00:28:20,474 --> 00:28:24,143
There you go. You know, this is a brisk story. It's

326
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,211
it's just one of those stories that Barks does about one character

327
00:28:30,228 --> 00:28:31,226
trying to come out ahead.

328
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:32,379
And

329
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:43,368
sometimes Donald wins out, but more often than not, Barks likes to see him as the underdog. So, you know, we're kinda... We we revert to the status quo as so often happens

330
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:53,467
by the end of these stories. We we'll we'll talk about that myth best stuff in a moment. Just first Ryan, What's your impression of this story? How'd you like it? I I thought it was pretty funny.

331
00:28:53,844 --> 00:28:54,503
I thought

332
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,984
Uncle Scrooge was a pretty despicable villain in this one Yeah.

333
00:28:59,482 --> 00:29:10,570
Where he just feels like... And and once you kinda framed it as, you know, Donald Way Donald Way overs stepped at the beginning asking for fifty thousand, and that was an insulting high number. That is true.

334
00:29:12,385 --> 00:29:12,885
But

335
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:14,641
but still just kind of

336
00:29:15,114 --> 00:29:18,325
using his omni over the entire world economy

337
00:29:18,782 --> 00:29:24,679
to force his own family to do lots of hard labor for him for free. Yeah.

338
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:39,436
Not to mention even if it was just that, that would be one thing, but now you say we're back to the status quo, and I wanted to add We're back to the status quo plus some traumatic brain injury for Donald Duck, who was in a coma for four days after being.

339
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:40,888
Punched by a gigantic

340
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:42,667
Who had a an iron

341
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:44,504
horseshoe and his glove.

342
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:53,735
So I mean, you know, if Sc had not interfered, you know, Donald could have made some decent money being a painting model and then some decent money.

343
00:29:54,946 --> 00:29:56,482
Being a boxing

344
00:29:56,898 --> 00:29:59,846
competitor. Hopefully, in that order, you can't really reverse that order.

345
00:30:01,854 --> 00:30:05,585
Because once you've been all punched up, you not not a good model anymore. But

346
00:30:06,242 --> 00:30:12,110
it seems so bad. He seems so mean in this one Yeah. Yeah. Sc is really a sc

347
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,830
in many of his first few stories. You know? He's...

348
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:21,437
I guess, he's he's he's mischievous and that one we did Christmas on Bear Mountain.

349
00:30:21,975 --> 00:30:40,185
The old castle secret which was his very his second appearance yeah. That soften him up quite a bit, but... And then he kinda reverts and race to the south seas to being more of a sc draw not to mention, I feel like, you know, in the in the Ducktales cartoon or something when he's going up against Al gold or whatever,

350
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:52,265
these are these are rivals, you know, and they're on equal footing and he's trying to show his superiority or whatever. And this comic is just... It's just ten pages of him punching down as often in as hard as he can too. Yeah.

351
00:30:52,825 --> 00:30:57,445
You know, this Scrooge eye and his... The little kids he tried to take care of.

352
00:30:57,945 --> 00:30:58,980
Like and

353
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:01,098
it's just not not in.

354
00:31:01,877 --> 00:31:10,419
Yeah. Yeah. I agree. Barks clearly hadn't decided what to do with him. He he knew he liked using him. Obviously because he's already bringing him back

355
00:31:11,156 --> 00:31:13,012
in in pretty pretty quick

356
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:14,527
succession.

357
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:23,610
This this is like conte with the Voodoo Hut. Which I recorded a little while ago and and recently released and that that is

358
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:28,544
probably the height of sc as a villain where he's like outright

359
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,323
colonial who like, laughs about having cheated some natives out of their land. So

360
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:37,397
he's he's gonna course correct

361
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,850
with Sc

362
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,770
pretty quickly here and and

363
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:48,383
within just about a year from this, he's gonna be presenting him as you know, definitely still greedy,

364
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:51,860
but but with much more of a moral compass

365
00:31:52,398 --> 00:32:06,629
as part of his, like, default characterization, Yeah. I I like this one a lot. This this one is, I think very memorable, the idea that they come up with is fun. It's got a fun sequence. I wouldn't call it one of his best ten pager,

366
00:32:07,606 --> 00:32:15,307
especially when you consider, like, in in the index, you know, this one is ranked very, very high this one has a seven point six

367
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:22,111
out of ten and it's good for two hundred and thirty two out of the forty one thousand some Disney comics.

368
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:28,079
So that that places it very high especially relative to the ten pager, which are not usually Al

369
00:32:28,918 --> 00:32:30,995
remembered as well as the adventure stories.

370
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,427
This is probably within the top fifteen

371
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,265
to twenty

372
00:32:36,684 --> 00:32:39,681
of his ten page stories in in that fan ranking.

373
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:46,499
Man, Ryan, I've got... I've got to think that some of that is a little bit of inflation just due to the fact that this one like,

374
00:32:46,996 --> 00:32:53,030
you know, it kind of en into the the news a little bit. People remember it for these other reasons.

375
00:32:54,744 --> 00:33:00,976
Because, yeah, Myth busters had actually featured this one. This maybe one of the more famous Barks

376
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:01,570
stories

377
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:07,247
Do you mind kinda telling us in some terms what what the heck myth busters is?

378
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,628
It's show where they it was established to take like, urban myths

379
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:25,131
and test to see if that is, you know, a real thing that could happen or probably did happen. So they they'll declare... They'll do a bunch of tests and see if, you know, doing it the way the story goes

380
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:27,165
makes that thing happen.

381
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,851
And if not, then what would it take to make that thing happen?

382
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:39,660
That's how they usually go about it. I think the first episode was a one I had heard as a kid of a man who equipped her a rocket to his car

383
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,540
and

384
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,620
Had an accident at the end.

385
00:33:44,132 --> 00:33:46,786
So, yeah, this one, this one, they were actually...

386
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:53,066
In one episode, i I didn't remembered... I thought of it the episode as I was reading this up this issue.

387
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:56,377
And I probably saw it fifteen years ago, but

388
00:33:57,396 --> 00:34:02,630
it actually is based on this this comic. Nineteen forty nine Donald story, the sunken yacht by Karl Barks,

389
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:07,610
So... And I could not remember how it turned out because it's been too long, but I looked it up.

390
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:14,127
The myth was, you know, the ping pong Barks can be used to raise a sunken ship. And I I do remember they made their own

391
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:24,015
ship where they or they bought one or sunk one or something but they had one that they named the panic too. Yeah. That had had a hole in the side similar to uncle Sc

392
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,295
yacht here and then

393
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:33,007
and then I do remember them rigging up some kind of system to fire ping pong balls into the side, the open side of the ship underwater.

394
00:34:34,635 --> 00:34:35,135
And

395
00:34:35,915 --> 00:34:39,055
they expected that it would take probably sixty thousand

396
00:34:39,515 --> 00:34:40,535
ping pong balls,

397
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:41,895
and

398
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:49,020
they actually did get the boat to rise to the surface with twenty seven thousand ping pong balls. They noted that if

399
00:34:49,597 --> 00:34:52,852
if the containment of the balls were to fail, they would probably

400
00:34:53,485 --> 00:35:01,000
be in violation of the clean water act, which is true. You're know, allowed to just put junk in the water in the United States. And

401
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:07,200
so they they labeled it plausible. I would have labeled it confirmed. They say, you know, it's an imp large number

402
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,015
of ping pong balls, twenty seven thousand, but

403
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:15,415
Here we are on the last page of this comic. They describe it as a fantastic number of bing pong calls.

404
00:35:15,995 --> 00:35:34,125
And then if you look on the barge, if you... The one the one frame we have of the kids, on the deck with just box after box after box that could fit one of the nephews inside the box. And they're just dumping him down this giant funnel and jamming and down. That could very well be twenty seven thousand ping pong balls. Very easily. So I think I think

405
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:36,685
I think Barks has stumbled upon

406
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:37,485
some

407
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,139
verifiable

408
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,197
techniques here.

409
00:35:42,196 --> 00:35:57,757
Yeah. Absolutely. What what a fun episode it was. I remember it. You know, I I was all primed when I saw it the episode was about to be like, that's that's they're testing the myth from the Carl Barks. So I was so excited and they actually do show a couple of brief

410
00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:01,522
frames. I'm I'm pretty confident of of the comic itself

411
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:09,085
in the episode. I don't think they actually named chat Carl Barks in the episode. Although if you look up like the,

412
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:15,014
you know, the the media that supports it, they do mention the because they credit this story. But,

413
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:22,003
you know, Carl Marx is not really a household name in the United States. It would be more natural to just

414
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:24,920
name check the donald dot com. But...

415
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:30,286
But... Yeah, this one's pretty familiar to audiences. It's it's it's made appearances

416
00:36:30,743 --> 00:36:35,490
in others. You know, I I say I won't research these, but this one is a pretty notable one.

417
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:39,485
When when this was reprinted in

418
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:47,445
the eighties and I read it, they they had a neat feature on a couple of the stories that they paired called the science behind the stories.

419
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,433
And, you know, they mentioned that someone

420
00:36:51,385 --> 00:36:53,565
that there was a scientist

421
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:55,045
or a researcher

422
00:36:55,905 --> 00:37:00,105
in Denmark in nineteen sixty four, an inventor named Carl K,

423
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,540
remembered and adapted the idea from this story.

424
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,955
And so there was some reporting in in a nineteen sixty five issue of popular mechanics

425
00:37:09,654 --> 00:37:11,992
about this attempt to raise a

426
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:18,306
freighter that had caps sized with five thousand sheep in the Kuwait harbor

427
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:21,272
and it threatened to contaminate a water purification

428
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:23,903
plant. So he he didn't actually use

429
00:37:24,918 --> 00:37:26,734
ping pong balls. He used poly

430
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:40,086
foam, but he was inspired by the story, and and supposedly when he attempted to patent his idea, it was declined because a preliminary description of the invention had already been published,

431
00:37:40,645 --> 00:37:41,942
referring to this comic.

432
00:37:43,973 --> 00:37:46,111
And yeah, there's been a couple of other

433
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:55,507
reports on on this over the years. So I think it might be giving it too much credits to this, you know, cartoon physics idea, but it it obviously

434
00:37:55,883 --> 00:37:59,053
stood out enough that very invent people

435
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:04,020
and and then very people who who love to feature

436
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,990
catastrophic explosions in their entertaining show

437
00:38:08,728 --> 00:38:12,898
you know, they took the idea and ran with it. So this one

438
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:15,172
really fun story very memorable.

439
00:38:15,924 --> 00:38:22,555
I'm I'm glad to glad to get to cover it. Any other thoughts on this one, Ryan? No. I think I think we've squeezed it dry.

440
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,190
Yeah. Awesome.

441
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:29,190
Alright. Well, thanks for joining me and talking about

442
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,930
creative uses for Ping Pong balls.

443
00:38:32,825 --> 00:38:37,085
I would encourage listeners to reach out if they have any comments.

444
00:38:37,825 --> 00:38:42,774
For for these ten page podcast stories, I'm not going in any particular order.

445
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:50,170
So if if you have one that you'd really like to see feature, you know, give us a suggestion. I'm definitely not gonna cover them all.

446
00:38:50,864 --> 00:38:57,166
So you can reach out on the Facebook page, box Barks or bar Barks at g mail dot com.

447
00:38:57,899 --> 00:38:58,399
