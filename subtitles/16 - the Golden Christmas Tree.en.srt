00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:57,600
Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever, a devoted Ducktales comics span. I am here with the returning guest.

3
00:00:58,134 --> 00:00:58,634
And

4
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:01,350
please introduce yourself returning guests.

5
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:03,667
Hi. My name is Sara Santiago.

6
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:07,035
So once Sarah, thank you for

7
00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:10,028
coming back after a pretty epic

8
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:14,153
adventure story and the old Castle secret. We have

9
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:18,663
a a story that is a little bit less epic

10
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,428
today, I think. Right. But we should have some fun talking about it.

11
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:26,425
Yeah. Thanks for having me back. Yeah. Absolutely.

12
00:01:27,523 --> 00:01:33,155
We are gonna be talking today about the Golden Christmas tree, a pretty unusual

13
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:35,515
Barks adventure story.

14
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:39,555
You know, I think you mentioned to me that you

15
00:01:39,988 --> 00:01:45,093
have a little bit of experience with Christmas tree sales.

16
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:45,930
Right?

17
00:01:46,808 --> 00:01:50,194
I do. I am your resident Christmas three

18
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:51,232
sale

19
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:52,708
apparently.

20
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:57,355
So you you said you worked on Christmas tree lot for a while?

21
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:00,901
I did for a couple of seasons. I think at least

22
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:02,736
two, maybe three.

23
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:07,043
In high school, I worked at a Christmas tree lot in

24
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:08,694
Tempe, Arizona,

25
00:02:09,315 --> 00:02:10,555
selling Christmas trees.

26
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:23,212
And that it was kind of one of my favorite jobs. I I actually miss it. That's awesome. Yeah. I I never expected that you would have any kind of personal connection to this one when I ask you to do it. But

27
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:27,094
Well, I'm sure I'd get a little bit of good conversation in

28
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:27,971
about

29
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:30,420
Christmas trees of many colors.

30
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:31,398
But

31
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,490
But especially gold because again, we're talking about Golden Christmas tree.

32
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,423
And this story was published in october of nineteen

33
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:41,622
forty eight

34
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:45,337
in four color number two hundred and three.

35
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:48,349
Looking at how many times it's been reprinted,

36
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:55,590
including the original. There are seven different publications, a pretty average number of them. And this is one of our shorter

37
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:58,438
adventure length stories. This one

38
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:02,506
clocks in it only a scant twenty pages.

39
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,300
And

40
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:05,178
basically,

41
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:09,662
this one involves Donald And an Nephews facing off

42
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,816
against a Christmas tree hating witch

43
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:18,273
who may or may not be the witch from Snow items and seventh warp.

44
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:21,523
In an epic example of stunt casting,

45
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:23,037
Yeah. They've

46
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,290
they've

47
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,129
commissioned this little tiny comic just for her.

48
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,105
Right. I don't know if this one... So screamed editorial

49
00:03:33,485 --> 00:03:34,625
interference to you,

50
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,045
but that is definitely the case.

51
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:38,125
This. Really.

52
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,480
Yeah. This is one where

53
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,099
Barks

54
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,560
indicated that he had an editor

55
00:03:45,019 --> 00:04:01,483
suggestion. I think he even received a script. For this one when he was... Oh yeah. And so if if it doesn't seem, you know, you've only read a few of these this points so you may not have enough experience to be able to say that there are parts of it that don't seem very

56
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:02,421
Barks.

57
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,560
But

58
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:07,555
I think to a lot of readers, it might not feel very Barks

59
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:18,863
apart from the fact that it's a little bit jarring that the the wicked witch. Appears in this one. It did feel different to me. Not just the the... you know, this

60
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:21,080
what I kept calling casting.

61
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:29,555
But it it seemed like the boys were in parallel and Donald had to save them, which is

62
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:31,328
the opposite of

63
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:37,040
every other example that I've seen so far. Yeah. That's right. It's it's very out of character.

64
00:04:37,514 --> 00:04:47,167
For the boys. You know, I I read a few a bit of commentary on this and a lot of people point out that Barks has to kind of make the nephews much more juvenile

65
00:04:47,666 --> 00:05:08,821
in this one because the way they're usually characterized, they wouldn't really fall into this kind of track and they wouldn't really act this way. That was another question I had. Was the... It... It... So it starts off with them fighting over what color Christmas Tree they want. And I haven't seen them fight in

66
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:14,968
handful of comics that I've read with you. Is that something that they do often?

67
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,106
I would say it's a little bit out of character.

68
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:25,874
I think that you see that kind of characterization much more in the short gag comics, you know, the ten pager that I've

69
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:27,869
alluded to a few times.

70
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:34,425
But but really, Barks is just gonna do what he wants to do with these characters.

71
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,219
Sometimes if he needs them to act more juvenile,

72
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,300
they will. But but, yeah, it it is a little bit out of character.

73
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,139
They will sq

74
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:46,350
in in many of the stories.

75
00:05:47,524 --> 00:05:53,066
I like that fight, you know, in the beginning. It's it's a little bit off putting, but I think if you have brothers Al

76
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,938
it probably seems familiar to

77
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,296
a lot of listeners.

78
00:05:57,715 --> 00:06:06,104
But, yeah, we're we're we already have a lot to say here. So let me let me just go into a little bit. More background Trivia will launch into that story.

79
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:17,699
I I mentioned that, you know, he is known to have been... He he had a little bit of sour attitude about having to do this one because it was a little bit fo on Barks,

80
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:25,751
I don't know explicitly if they told him oh you need to use the wicked witch from snow white.

81
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:26,628
But

82
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:29,833
that is not something that he regularly

83
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,348
does. You know, he doesn't

84
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:32,863
pluck characters

85
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,256
from other Disney properties

86
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:36,772
very often.

87
00:06:37,803 --> 00:06:44,415
It's it's very unusual. Like, there's one story where it uses more and fe who are Mickey Nephews.

88
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:51,375
There's one single mickey mouse comic that he did that was not a Ducktales, but there was no, like, crossover

89
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:52,990
between the ducks and Mickey.

90
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:56,024
That was that was very unusual

91
00:06:56,644 --> 00:06:57,984
to have him do that.

92
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:10,350
He also commented in a letter that he wrote to a fan that he had to make a lot of changes to this one to suit the editor needs and that they even wrote rewrote some of his dialogue

93
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:16,786
near the end of the story, they made it. What he considered very preach and very sap

94
00:07:17,323 --> 00:07:19,457
because this one does have a very, like, moral

95
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:33,214
sac Gladstone that's kind of out of character for for Barks himself. So we can we can take a look at those panels where we get there. I did wanna to mention a few of the titles from around the world. I've been having fun doing these.

96
00:07:33,814 --> 00:07:35,074
So I'll just share

97
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,569
three or four of these. So in in

98
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:47,975
most of the languages, this has been just translated directly it's generally just called the Golden Christmas tree. So in France, it was

99
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,769
and noel

100
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:52,481
in Germany, was their golden

101
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:53,975
bomb,

102
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:56,208
In Mexico is.

103
00:07:59,023 --> 00:07:59,883
I don't usually

104
00:08:00,302 --> 00:08:02,000
see a listing for Mongolia.

105
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:08,087
For whatever reason, this one was published in Mongolia. So I have to say it's called A

106
00:08:08,506 --> 00:08:09,265
Got sewer.

107
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,539
Golden Christmas tree and Mongolia.

108
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:12,719
Nice.

109
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,579
Yeah. Oh and then it was published in yu yugoslavia.

110
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:18,414
The dearly departed

111
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:19,494
Yugoslavia.

112
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:23,394
And I think I think the language would be Serbian

113
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:25,234
and it was called z

114
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:26,769
Nova.

115
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:38,438
So there are some of your versions of the Golden Christmas tree from around the world, the value range. You know, we've been talking about I've been mentioning the value of these comics, it's

116
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:39,436
decreasing

117
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:49,428
steadily as we get further out of the golden age of comics. So at some point I'll probably stop. But this is still fairly valuable and a nine point two edition

118
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:52,600
is two thousand two hundred and fifty dollars.

119
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,112
Well. And

120
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,110
Sarah, did you

121
00:08:57,808 --> 00:09:00,146
have any kind of historical

122
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:04,267
our cultural context that you wanted to talk about

123
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,110
outside of, you know, the story itself before we get into it.

124
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:12,425
So I'll just mention that,

125
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:14,904
you know, the Christmas tree tradition

126
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:16,119
is

127
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:19,474
I think it goes back to something like the sixteenth

128
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:20,313
century

129
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:23,803
and is generally agreed to started in Germany.

130
00:09:24,182 --> 00:09:24,682
And

131
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:26,360
I will mention

132
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:30,255
to give some context to the wicked witch appearing that snow white.

133
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:36,196
Was just a colossal hit for for Disney. Right? It kinda rescued the studio.

134
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:38,370
And at at this point,

135
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:42,165
it's only eleven years old, and they had

136
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:51,220
their first re release ever of the film, which would have been a big event, you know, in another itself was just four years before this story was published

137
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,220
in nineteen forty four.

138
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:01,549
And so the wicked could witch is gonna actually show up in a lot of other Disney media. Gonna karen a lot of other Disney comics,

139
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:08,475
not Carl Barks comics that I'm aware of, but you know, she kind of pops up and, like, burr rabbit tails

140
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:16,078
and little bad wolf from some of the other like big cast of characters from walt Disney's comics and stories.

141
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:19,011
And and I did find that Barks

142
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,106
himself actually submitted some gag

143
00:10:23,337 --> 00:10:25,354
for the production of snow white,

144
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:29,763
hoping that he could work on it, but he didn't ultimately get to work on that one.

145
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:38,374
Let's see what? What do you think is our version of Donald? How do you think we should characterize him in this? Because as you mentioned,

146
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:42,801
the Nephews are a much more, like juvenile version of themselves.

147
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:44,597
Yeah. He seemed

148
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:49,638
put together and determined

149
00:10:50,294 --> 00:10:50,794
Right.

150
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,787
And and and,

151
00:10:53,124 --> 00:11:02,222
you know, not kind of his disorganized self. Yeah. He's pretty level heading this one. And and I mean, he's usually very determined, but it's usually like a much more

152
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,815
branch. Hot headed determination. Exactly.

153
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:11,175
Alright. So I I'm ready to get into it. I look forward to your comments.

154
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:15,285
Ready to talk about the Golden Christmas tree? Red axles.

155
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:21,649
So it opens with the net fuse having kind of a violent brother's arguments

156
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:24,883
while Donald is reading the newspaper

157
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:31,249
They are coming to blows over what color a Christmas tree they'd like to get.

158
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:34,009
And meanwhile Donald is reading in the news

159
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,902
about a witch that's been spotted in the area and is

160
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:41,539
destroying Christmas tree. She is explicitly

161
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:46,430
identified as resembling the one that poisoned snow white, which kind of points to some

162
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,069
interesting universe

163
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,990
implications for the story.

164
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:53,089
Donald dismiss the story is laughable.

165
00:11:53,504 --> 00:12:02,720
And the nephews gradually stop arguing and tell donald, but they have agreed on which color of tree they'd like to get. So we had talked about previously

166
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,820
in our messaging about this that it seemed odd.

167
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,895
That there were all of these

168
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:17,748
choices of colors that they wanted a blue one that they wanted a a a purple one. And and they you know, and

169
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:24,580
none of them were either even consistent on the one that they wanted. So it just cycled through several colors

170
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:31,035
basically the entire rainbow, and and Donald says, oh, does it need to be painted Al like a rainbow.

171
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:32,275
And

172
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:37,284
that was kind of confusing for both of us, because we've never heard of

173
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:38,683
colored

174
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:40,520
christmas trees.

175
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:59,550
Right. And and this guy comes up as you researched the story that lot of people kind of bog at the fact that it's kind of presented as just in every day. Oh, this is one of the choices you make when you go to the Christmas tree lot. Did did your lot have any color choices, Sarah?

176
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:01,382
No. We had

177
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:03,336
christmas tree color.

178
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:05,890
I have heard of

179
00:13:06,706 --> 00:13:07,206
some

180
00:13:08,197 --> 00:13:09,255
lots that will...

181
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:26,745
What's called flock, the Christmas tree, which is, like spray, kind of a a white ish foam on it to make it look like there's snow on it. And they'll do that for you at the lot. You know, that if that's a thing that you you choose or, you know, if you get a fake tree that it'll come that way.

182
00:13:27,637 --> 00:13:40,472
So it it was at least interesting that that was a thing... A decision you made at the lot and then you picked out a tree and and in the comic you they seemed to just... Oh, okay. We'll we'll paint it purple now. Right. But

183
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:45,000
Christmas trees only came in and they're not cheryl green color.

184
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,560
Try. Vanilla

185
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,700
as it what?

186
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,280
Vanilla color.

187
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,426
Yeah. I I always... Even as a kid, I thought this was weird,

188
00:13:54,144 --> 00:14:00,405
the way it presented it, because you know, as a kid you you do think about Christmas trees a lot. And I remember being super excited every year.

189
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:14,124
And from what I can tell, I think there have been times where you could buy Christmas trees of different colors, but I don't think in my race research, at least. It doesn't look like there was ever an era in America

190
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:20,026
where it was like routine. You know, I think it's a special order thing or you paint it yourself

191
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,558
I know that famously,

192
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:28,650
our former first lady in the states decorated with red Christmas trees a couple years.

193
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:33,317
In which which many people found very off putting. But

194
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:43,151
that's the only time I've ever seen a reference to another color besides this. And it would be with the way that natural things are shaped, especially

195
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:48,754
fur and pine trees. It seems like it would be difficult to get it

196
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:49,593
completely

197
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:50,951
to the color.

198
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:58,360
Yeah. Yeah. I I don't imagine it coming out very nice unless you, like, totally dip and something that's

199
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,920
gotta be

200
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,540
not very good for your health.

201
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:17,049
So I guess, you know, this is really of those situations where this is meant to be about a golden Christmas tree and so this universe has got it needs to have this as an option. And so it does. And, you know, to its credit

202
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:24,597
by by a few pages in, I'm... I'm I'm into it and i'm buying it. Yeah. It it was funny that I was...

203
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:30,395
I could suspend my disbelief for a golden Christmas tree mh but not for a purple one.

204
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,847
Right. Right. Yeah.

205
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:34,306
Alright. So

206
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:47,475
when they come to Donald, they inform him that as you said, they would like a golden Christmas tree and Donald kind of branches and he counts as his pocket change, hoping that it's not gonna be too expensive.

207
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:51,127
And on their way, they're passing stores

208
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:59,733
with the the kind of the old trope. I love seeing this old trope. Right? You you need to hear some news so you walk by the store that sells Tv

209
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:02,250
or radios and they're broadcasting,

210
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:04,646
some setup. And

211
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:09,739
in this case, it's broadcasting stories of the witch terror the town.

212
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,419
And Donald kind of sm

213
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:14,630
you know, dismissing the possibility.

214
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:21,785
And when the Nephew asked about it, he stops that this is just a racket to get people to buy more christmas trees.

215
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:30,751
And so they they get to the tree lot and sure enough they encounter trees in all colors and Donald

216
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,782
immediately gets a bad case of sticker shock.

217
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:54,624
So from my experience in the late nineties working at a Christmas very lot. I would actually say those are pretty accurate prices, you know, the the blue ones are fifteen forty eight red ones are twenty ninety eight. And then they have old rows, which I thought was really funny given how popular

218
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:56,624
rose gold is.

219
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:02,514
Right now. And and then strawberry pink. Those are twenty six fifty.

220
00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:09,360
And those seems like totally normal Christmas tree prices for what I'm used to, obviously, in the late nineties,

221
00:17:10,178 --> 00:17:12,596
you know, our our bottom of the line

222
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:21,090
I think it was either Douglas for Western ba where we started about sixteen, if you got one that was like four to five feet,

223
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:23,722
And then I looked up the

224
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:25,560
inflation calculator

225
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:27,358
and those

226
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:30,115
fifteen ninety eight or fifteen

227
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:36,883
those fifteen forty eight ones would be about today's equivalent of a hundred and sixty

228
00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:38,082
two dollars.

229
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,405
And I tried a couple of different inflation calculators because that just seemed

230
00:17:44,823 --> 00:17:47,018
way too off. Way just wild.

231
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:48,116
And

232
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:53,836
Yeah. One fifty eight to one sixty two was was the range I got. So we definitely

233
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,770
understand why Donald was blanc.

234
00:17:56,264 --> 00:17:59,119
And, yeah, I remember vividly in the late nineties,

235
00:17:59,816 --> 00:18:02,033
slapping a tree home just a couple days

236
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:05,325
before Christmas that I got for, like, fifteen dollars.

237
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:13,790
Because it was so close to Christmas. So so, yeah, these prices are are pretty high. And and so on the next page,

238
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:14,943
Donald

239
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:19,311
gets off. We get we get a gag about needing smelling salts.

240
00:18:20,947 --> 00:18:21,447
He

241
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:28,387
he gets off that good line about... you know, do you have smelling salts for when I hear the price for a gold tree.

242
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:31,775
And we do see a can in the background

243
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:38,248
behind him of the spray paint that must be coating these trees. And so

244
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:39,946
the Ducktales

245
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:41,838
we cut to the Ducktales

246
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:45,129
walking home with a very sad green

247
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:47,082
tree and Donald is

248
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:51,443
despair at the cost of a golden one. And the kids

249
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:56,371
they sit on the curb to have a good cry. Oh, I think it was forty. Right?

250
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:06,298
It was forty dollars which in today's money would be about four hundred thirty two. Wow. Yeah. So I I understand why Donald

251
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,070
couldn't lead with that.

252
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:14,410
So the kids sit on the curb to have a good cry. And from behind fence, we can

253
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:18,335
spot that the witch. Is spying on them because we

254
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:23,162
we get her thought balloon which states that she needs their tears for her potion.

255
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,215
And when she comes over the fence,

256
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:36,497
she appears as a kindly old lady who consoles them and tells them that she can direct them to a genuine golden tree. I think I I think my

257
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,566
calculations were for the nineties.

258
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:46,041
Back to when I was working there. Let me... Yeah. That makes sense. Calculate.

259
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:50,747
Yeah. Close enough. The twenty twenty one would be the

260
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,080
fifteen dollars

261
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,280
would be

262
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,400
one seventy right now, so I did do it for the nineteen nineties.

263
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:57,780
Right.

264
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:05,710
But that gives us a pretty good idea. Yeah. Okay. So a quick correction that I wanna make. Mh. Is that the

265
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,010
inflationary figures that I gave for nineteen forties Christmas tree,

266
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:18,665
and then what it would be in today's money was actually, I did a calculation based on when I would have been selling such a christmas tree in the nineteen nineties.

267
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:20,405
They would obviously be

268
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:21,785
quite a bit more today.

269
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:34,695
Right. Yeah. No worries. Cumulative of inflation apparently from nineteen forty eight to today is one thousand thirty five point one percent Yeah. So yikes. Absolutely.

270
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:35,935
Alright.

271
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:38,595
So on the next page,

272
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:46,030
the lady indicates that the genuine Golden tree grows on the highest crowd of mount demon tooth.

273
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:52,756
This is the first time that Barks is gonna reference that. That's Al landmark and Ducktales that he's gonna use a few times.

274
00:20:53,688 --> 00:21:00,483
And and the boys cheer up and they head immediately towards the mountain as you pointed out, you know, they're being very cr.

275
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:02,453
And unlike their usual

276
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:04,891
characterization here. And then

277
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,048
the the lady immediately

278
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:09,425
turns very creepy looking.

279
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,980
And transforms into the witch.

280
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,120
She grabs her broom and races ahead of an nephews u's.

281
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:26,022
And on the mountain, the boys encounter Barks for trail and then they do a double take on seeing a sign that indicates the tree is on the right word path. So I'm

282
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,476
not ex knowing what to expect.

283
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:36,172
Was actually kind of like, oh, that which is really adorable. It's just an old lady Mh. And she's

284
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:38,622
got cute little glasses.

285
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,500
And

286
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:45,247
she just looks like she's a very sweet one. It didn't occur to me that, like, her being

287
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,615
you know, humanoid, human

288
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,667
might be a giveaway.

289
00:21:50,783 --> 00:21:53,715
It didn't occur to me that she would transform into

290
00:21:54,132 --> 00:21:56,205
the wicked witch but she did.

291
00:21:56,585 --> 00:21:57,965
How often humans...

292
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:02,525
Like, human humans is used. So I think I think she's

293
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:06,216
drawn as one of the human like cakes, actually.

294
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:12,073
Okay. Because that nose I read it as, like, the the Barks sort of p,

295
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:18,272
And and Barb has kind of a well that he goes to. Right? Most of the human like characters

296
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,925
are done as dogs in these stories.

297
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:25,136
With kind of like, pigs and and various birds,

298
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:26,674
ducks and

299
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,290
gander and other birds being the next most common.

300
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:31,444
So

301
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:37,810
I think she's supposed to look like one of the pigs not a true human. The the pink... In that

302
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:47,190
one where she's kind of transforming back to her normal self. I can see I can see pig resemblance, but Yeah. She just looked like i a typical cute cra.

303
00:22:47,924 --> 00:22:53,687
Yeah. I could see for that. I could see why you thought she looked human like. And isn't isn't that a little transitional

304
00:22:54,224 --> 00:22:55,442
panel where she's

305
00:22:55,819 --> 00:23:01,816
got the witches kind of expressive, but she still looks like the the kindly lady is not very unsettling.

306
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:03,433
Yeah.

307
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:04,648
Yeah. It is.

308
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:14,426
Alright. And and I remember reading this for the first time being like, wow, this is so weird that the witch is here, because that's clearly the witch from Snow white.

309
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:19,965
Right. And and on the next page, that witch from Snow white it is transforming

310
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:20,842
back

311
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,152
from the sign that she has turned into.

312
00:23:25,345 --> 00:23:25,845
And

313
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:38,134
Donald meanwhile realizes that the boys aren't home yet. So he goes off to search and he encounters their footprint and follows those and then he sees some point to chew footprints

314
00:23:38,473 --> 00:23:41,370
such as might be worn by a witch

315
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:43,599
not that he believes in witches.

316
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:44,578
And

317
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:52,257
then when Donald sees that the footprints seemed to include Barks where a broom has taken off he panic and

318
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:57,230
and then he calls out the police who immediately cast a very wide net.

319
00:23:58,322 --> 00:24:06,616
Donald takes a moment to stop and consider what which is likely destination would be, and he thinks about mountain Demon too, so he sets off.

320
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:19,872
Meanwhile, on mountain demon tooth, the Nephews encounter a chasm them, and they again do a double take as they see a log that's bridging the span that wasn't there before. And on the next page,

321
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:28,318
the nephews used crossed the log and they advance to the summit of the mountain where they instantly find the golden Christmas tree right next to a cabin.

322
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:36,125
This is one of those moments where it should probably seem like they got to it too easily. Right? But the tree poof out of it existence

323
00:24:36,465 --> 00:24:37,845
just as they approach

324
00:24:38,305 --> 00:24:40,485
and the which is behind them

325
00:24:41,585 --> 00:24:42,085
testing

326
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:50,180
and looking on. Yeah. And she's she's there her in her normal self instead of in the cute granny lady

327
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:50,800
self.

328
00:24:51,493 --> 00:25:06,412
Right. So I I wonder if they're starting to get suspicious at that point. Yeah. We don't even see, like, her take a Al triumphant moment to Tackle that she fooled them or or anything like that. That's not what. Yeah. Dory is interested in.

329
00:25:07,384 --> 00:25:10,760
I I... It's not interested in in in kind of

330
00:25:11,258 --> 00:25:13,875
falls and and Barks and and

331
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:17,850
failing a few times before they get to their goal.

332
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:26,985
Yeah. Because the journey of mount demon to, seems like it should be much more fraught but, you know, the witch is kind of just advanced to the long.

333
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:31,945
I think that the energy of the story is really working towards

334
00:25:33,218 --> 00:25:36,568
Donald kind of siege of the cabin that's coming up.

335
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:37,445
Mh.

336
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:42,625
Alright. So on the next page, we transition back to Donald, who is In hot pursuit

337
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:45,380
but he gets stalled at that chasm.

338
00:25:46,037 --> 00:25:56,180
Meanwhile, in which is cabin cottage or whatever, she is cage. He be doing Lily. And encouraging them to work up a good cry as she grabs

339
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,980
an array of witches

340
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,920
ingredients to mix up a potion.

341
00:26:00,454 --> 00:26:01,631
Kind of a fun little

342
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:11,055
panel showing some of the the neat little ingredients. Do you mind telling us what some of those fun ingredients are, Sarah? So I thought the ingredients were really cute.

343
00:26:11,393 --> 00:26:13,847
There's some gould rule Mh

344
00:26:14,544 --> 00:26:15,483
of tears.

345
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:16,934
Hate.

346
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:33,085
That one I had a question about, is there, like, love min? Or is there some some kind of cultural reference that I'm missing or just like, oh, these mint are for hate or hate. Yeah. I don't I don't know. Because it does sound like it should be referencing something, but

347
00:26:33,704 --> 00:26:39,438
no. It's just pretty stark hate. And she has the typical witch is called ran over a fire

348
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,926
and a a skull that seems to be a container of some sort.

349
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:44,764
Right.

350
00:26:45,182 --> 00:26:49,234
Although with eye holes, I don't know how great of a container

351
00:26:49,812 --> 00:26:50,251
is.

352
00:26:50,824 --> 00:26:56,269
I bet it's for measuring. Mh. Mh. Alright. And so on the next page, we learn...

353
00:26:57,006 --> 00:27:03,747
On the next page, we learn that the witches evil plan is to destroy all the Christmas trees on Earth

354
00:27:04,246 --> 00:27:06,105
thus apparently destroying happiness.

355
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:15,798
And back at the chasm, Donald uses the old snowball trick. He rolls the snowball down to span the gap and he he goes onward.

356
00:27:16,555 --> 00:27:24,605
And the witch is just in the process of getting tears from the boys. I did like the little demons

357
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:27,196
that didn't look like they were part of the

358
00:27:27,572 --> 00:27:28,285
of her

359
00:27:28,743 --> 00:27:33,687
con in the cauldron. They just looked like they were having a leisure swim. This is what we do.

360
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:36,778
We're helping stir this how relaxing

361
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,945
Yeah. I I agree i like that pan Al lot. And

362
00:27:41,404 --> 00:27:46,593
so the witch gets startled by a knock on the door and she spies Donald through the people.

363
00:27:47,092 --> 00:27:50,828
She thinks fast and she turns into a bombshell

364
00:27:51,446 --> 00:27:58,939
female duck. One of the writings I read about this suggested that she might be intended to look like the pin up girl,

365
00:27:59,316 --> 00:28:00,254
Betty Gray.

366
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:06,339
But Donald is not distracted by her. I I I liked that. Right? It's a cliche

367
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:12,187
to have the hero get distracted by by a beauty and

368
00:28:12,846 --> 00:28:24,416
she tells him that she can point him in the direction of the witch, but he has to help her with her knit. And so she spins Ducktales of knowing where the witch is by the smell of her terrible potion,

369
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:27,186
at which point Donald sniff the air in the cottage.

370
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,538
I thought that was a clever

371
00:28:30,396 --> 00:28:30,896
ru

372
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:31,735
to

373
00:28:32,074 --> 00:28:32,693
kind of

374
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:38,025
hap bind his hands right. He's gotta hold his hands together, so she can

375
00:28:38,725 --> 00:28:40,625
unwind this skiing and

376
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:43,785
wrap it around his hands. That's kind of a normal

377
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:46,116
thing that you do with yarn

378
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:51,542
when you're working with it, and and it kind of... It mobilize his hands

379
00:28:52,335 --> 00:28:52,835
to

380
00:28:53,135 --> 00:29:02,929
make him less of a threat. I thought that was really clever. Yeah. I agree. That that was a neat little sequence, and I feel like this would have looked probably a lot more natural,

381
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:05,566
you know, back in the late forties

382
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:13,695
that this is kind of one of the ideas of femininity is that you're always doing the knit And and, you know, i I think

383
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:19,915
this wouldn't maybe play the same way today. Right? Mh. It's it's... The knit is not as common.

384
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:22,184
The those of us that work with

385
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,375
craft would know. But knit and crochet and such are not as common as they

386
00:29:27,955 --> 00:29:32,211
used to be. Right. And so Donald realizes that this

387
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:33,569
bombshell

388
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:44,580
duck has a foul smelling cauldron her south. But it's too late. She has his wrists bound in that yarn, and she transforms back into the witch.

389
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:46,853
But donald is too quick.

390
00:29:47,272 --> 00:29:49,171
He freaks out he escapes,

391
00:29:49,629 --> 00:30:02,425
but then he kinda stops himself. He realizes that even if he's a afraid, you can abandon on this nephews and he asked go back. And so on the next page, we get a sequence of Donald trying to break in and the witch

392
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:03,583
defending.

393
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:16,120
It's it's very imaginative. You know, he uses a log as a battering ram. She transforms into a wood grinding machine I like the the little side gag of her

394
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:25,867
turning the pulp of the wood into a a newspaper that says which foil house breaker that's that's probably my favorite sequence in this.

395
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:29,377
Yeah. It you know, it threw me back to

396
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:31,625
the twenty eleven

397
00:30:31,962 --> 00:30:34,416
green lantern movie that was

398
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,602
so disappointing. U. You know, the green lantern

399
00:30:39,155 --> 00:30:40,453
power was that he could

400
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,291
turn into anything,

401
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,968
right? And

402
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:45,566
problem solve

403
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,619
that way. And

404
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:50,176
this little twenty one page comic,

405
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,731
the problem solving that the... Which floyd turning into

406
00:30:55,165 --> 00:30:57,065
a log to cross a chasm

407
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:10,893
a a wood grinder with a newspaper printer at the end. And then on the next page, a little machine that has three little gravity arms to grab each of the voice that was just infinitely more impressive than

408
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:13,578
full budget, Hollywood blockbuster

409
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:15,770
from ten years ago.

410
00:31:16,147 --> 00:31:16,785
That's awesome.

411
00:31:17,263 --> 00:31:23,320
Yeah. I would agree. I I think to me that this is kind of the strongest part of this.

412
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:34,515
You know, otherwise, not too remarkable story is these, like transformation sequences. They're the most entertaining thing in it. They're and they're so creative and so clever. Yeah. Definitely.

413
00:31:34,855 --> 00:31:37,250
Alright. So on the next page,

414
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:40,087
the witch turns her attention back to an Nephews

415
00:31:40,626 --> 00:31:50,095
only to realize that they have escaped and they're in the process of being about to tip her potion as she angrily turns into that duck catching machine

416
00:31:50,395 --> 00:31:54,955
that you commented on. And I like that it basically seems to have exactly one purpose.

417
00:31:55,489 --> 00:31:57,665
Right? Because if you can transform into anything,

418
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:04,863
why why limit yourself to anything, but exactly the thing that you need. Yeah. And

419
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,859
so Donald

420
00:32:07,276 --> 00:32:13,580
despair that the cabin is all shutter up, and she's, you know, hadn't advantage right now. And so on the next page,

421
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,180
the witch attempts again to get the nephews used to cry into the cauldron.

422
00:32:19,695 --> 00:32:26,346
But she gets battered with her own broom by Donald who explains that he came down the Chimney just like Santa Claus.

423
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:33,631
And the witch intends to change into a cat amount to attack them, but she finds that she can't transform.

424
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:43,396
Mark, do you know what a cat amount is? I think it's just a wildcat cat. Isn't that? Let's see what Google says. Yeah. You don't you don't really see the term cat amount.

425
00:32:44,209 --> 00:33:04,218
A wow. Yeah. Google says it's a Cougar. Yeah. So I don't know if that's just a a saying that's out of style. I know I've heard it. A little bit before, but but but it it definitely stands out. Right? And so on the next page, she realizes that the reason she can't transform is because Donald is holding her magic broom.

426
00:33:04,877 --> 00:33:06,815
He directs her at room point

427
00:33:07,314 --> 00:33:08,733
and the Nephews

428
00:33:09,312 --> 00:33:15,105
explain what the potion for. Rather than tipping it Donald decides to

429
00:33:15,405 --> 00:33:17,385
set the cabin on fire

430
00:33:17,805 --> 00:33:18,305
and

431
00:33:18,965 --> 00:33:20,305
the anguish witch

432
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,416
claims that it contains her life's work.

433
00:33:23,976 --> 00:33:26,812
Three thousand years worth of it. You know,

434
00:33:28,785 --> 00:33:34,258
had she been trying to get rid of Christmas trees for three thousand years or just was it like other work?

435
00:33:34,897 --> 00:33:35,397
Because...

436
00:33:37,188 --> 00:33:38,526
There's some acronyms

437
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:39,882
with

438
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:40,880
Christmas

439
00:33:41,696 --> 00:33:42,595
in general.

440
00:33:43,013 --> 00:33:51,370
Yeah. I guess, some of her other evil schemes are going up in smoke. And, you know, there's there's part of me that's like, is this

441
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,567
proportionate, but she did kid kidnapped his nephews.

442
00:33:54,905 --> 00:33:57,762
So, you know, I guess, house bla.

443
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,775
Alright. And so on the next page,

444
00:34:01,155 --> 00:34:02,575
the witch is scheming.

445
00:34:02,995 --> 00:34:15,870
And she determines to act like something is stuck in between her teeth and is able to Donald out of one of the straws of her broom. And that's just enough for her to be able to transform and do a fire ex

446
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,810
to try to put out the blaze.

447
00:34:18,384 --> 00:34:27,725
And at this point, Huey, dewey and Louie can redeem themselves. Right? They get a little smarter. They figure out how she's doing her transformation and they encourage donald.

448
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,100
To use the broom to make a wish to stop her.

449
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:38,409
And instantly the boys roar out of control as he has turned her into a gas camp. And

450
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,884
now he becomes kinda drunk with power.

451
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:50,394
This is a pretty entertaining page, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Again, with the excellent problem solving with trends

452
00:34:51,250 --> 00:35:01,046
transformation. Right? Yeah. I just love it. It really escalate pretty well. And I like Mcdonald's expression when you realizes he's a witch now himself.

453
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:10,004
Alright. And so with his newfound power, he transforms himself into a handsome and tall Ducktales,

454
00:35:10,123 --> 00:35:21,189
you know, intriguing looks a lot like glad stone gander, I think. And and Gladstone is a new character at this point, but he he appeared for the first time just a few months before this.

455
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:32,120
He intends to make some more wishes, but one of the nephews snags the broom and he wishes for that sought after Golden Christmas tree, which poof into existence

456
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:38,304
immediately and is suddenly talking and thanking them for sub doing the evil witch.

457
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:46,202
I had a question about this this the fashion choices for handsome donald. U.

458
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:52,765
Kind of... Yeah. Definitely it... It reminded me of Cla. It did remind me of Gladstone Gander.

459
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:56,793
Who made me think of nineteen

460
00:35:57,331 --> 00:36:00,186
twenties and thirties era fashion.

461
00:36:00,524 --> 00:36:02,915
Would you would you say that's accurate.

462
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:10,876
You know to me it reminds me is it... I'm trying to think of which old hollywood actor, probably from the late thirties.

463
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:14,437
Forties has that kind of like, wavy hair.

464
00:36:15,313 --> 00:36:17,008
Not bog art, but

465
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,773
someone from that era, It's definitely

466
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,328
an interesting

467
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:23,004
version of masculinity

468
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:25,636
that he's imagining. Right? Yeah.

469
00:36:26,013 --> 00:36:33,355
It it the slick hair. It just it reminds me of the song putting on the r. Right? Yes. Yes. Absolutely.

470
00:36:33,814 --> 00:36:40,705
Right. It's very r. There's a story, another Barks story where he wants to Gladstone

471
00:36:40,705 --> 00:36:43,765
is a member of a club called the idle Dandy

472
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,377
and then that's what he looks like to me. Looks dandy

473
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:53,861
in this. Yeah. That one with his eyes closed, it's it's kind of a feminine looking and

474
00:36:55,198 --> 00:36:59,131
contrast to, I think you know, there's a lot of anxiety over masculinity

475
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:01,340
in these. So it is interesting, which

476
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:06,091
kind of pictures for himself in this little throw away sequence. Yeah.

477
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:15,336
Especially if it's kind of dated fashion for that type. If I'm correct on my fashion history. Right. Yeah. I'm not sure. But...

478
00:37:15,715 --> 00:37:16,655
But it's definitely...

479
00:37:16,955 --> 00:37:48,077
It definitely stands out now. And so on the next page, the tree explains that it is the spirit of Christmas. Donald feeling very ashamed of his selfish wish and when he learns this. So he re the broom thinking, you know, at least I've got my my hands some good luck, not realizing that he's gonna trans... He's gonna revert. And and so that this makes him so upset when he changes back he kicks the gas cam and the witch ends up falling to her doom. And the Golden Christmas

480
00:37:48,574 --> 00:37:54,777
explains that Donald has now saved Christmas and ben promptly leaves. And and those

481
00:37:55,251 --> 00:37:57,231
These pages, these panels

482
00:37:57,531 --> 00:38:08,359
feel very rushed. Right? And these are some of these Barks some of those panels that were either redone for him or that Barks was asked to redo because it all feels very.

483
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:13,563
Right? And very, like, oh, let's make up the fact that he's a selfless

484
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:16,595
hero now. Yeah. And then so

485
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:19,161
I just was wondering who

486
00:38:19,737 --> 00:38:31,663
who delivers Christmas trees at night. Yeah. Is they're like, an Uber Christmas tree, Yeah. And your Uber eats. To the last the the the fun gag. I do like this gag at the end where

487
00:38:32,082 --> 00:38:37,666
we see the town's folk kind of pondering, you know, what the the the hero of the du.

488
00:38:38,043 --> 00:38:40,436
And so as we transition to Christmas morning,

489
00:38:40,971 --> 00:38:43,751
Donald is exhausted because he's been up signing

490
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:48,151
delivery receipts all night and shows an Nephews

491
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:54,926
outside eighteen thousand seven hundred and sixty six golden Christmas trees. And as you say, that's

492
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:57,326
that is a very efficient

493
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,539
delivery company in Duck.

494
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:06,472
Anyone who can get that done overnight can do pretty much. On Christmas eve night, no less.

495
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:08,623
Right. On Christmas.

496
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:22,043
I think any one of those is probably a couple hours of effort between the delivery and the painting and and ever. Right. But I have no problem accepting that there's a trade talks that is the embodiment of the spirit of Christmas.

497
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:23,061
Right.

498
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:29,518
And and that was battling against the nemesis of the Fairy tale Princess,

499
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:31,433
snow white before

500
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:37,627
relocating to Mountain D two. That's side of Duck. Right. Right. Yeah. So this this one is a pretty unusual one.

501
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:46,101
What what did you think about it overall, Sarah? I I felt like it was a little bit more simple, a little bit more streamlined

502
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:53,551
I I do kind of like when they can get from a to b without a lot of the

503
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:54,871
falls and failures.

504
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:58,164
That's just kind of my preference.

505
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,433
I like to see people succeed even if it's

506
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:26,032
succeeding in getting up a mountain so that a wicked and which can capture you. Right. Yeah. The the pacing on this one is is weird. And to me, this one, it feels like what it is. Right? Because Barks had these, like, adventure stories and he had many, many more of those ten page storage. And it feels like something in between and it definitely feels like someone was like, it's the Christmas

507
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:29,356
season. Where you've gotta you gotta do a Christmas story

508
00:40:29,934 --> 00:40:36,808
and it feels like something that he had voiced upon him. But but you know what? Later on, he's gonna have another

509
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,696
holiday story with a witch

510
00:40:40,114 --> 00:40:41,532
voiced upon him.

511
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:42,371
But

512
00:40:42,948 --> 00:40:47,296
that one, it's trick treat is what I'm thinking of. He

513
00:40:47,636 --> 00:40:56,509
really like, enjoys is doing that one and and has a blast doing doing that one. Oh, I'll I'll have to bring you back for that one I think you'll

514
00:40:57,045 --> 00:41:06,728
huge think out of that Halloween story. But you know, this one feels like he's going through the motions a little bit. I do really like the, like, invasion of the cabin sequence

515
00:41:07,226 --> 00:41:18,143
overall. That one was fun. You know, this is definitely like a lower tier. Barks story for me. But but I I didn't. I didn't dislike. And it's just not one that I remember very fondly.

516
00:41:18,902 --> 00:41:19,936
Yeah. It seems

517
00:41:20,636 --> 00:41:21,936
it seems kind of

518
00:41:22,836 --> 00:41:31,231
forget in its simplicity but not bad. Yeah. And and I wonder if it had had, like it's a twenty pager I think.

519
00:41:31,771 --> 00:41:36,771
A lot of his best regarded ones are kinda span more like twenty four to thirty two pages.

520
00:41:37,185 --> 00:41:40,197
I wonder if it had a few more pages to develop.

521
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:53,570
I I don't know if it really could have improved on itself that much. It's just so weird, the witch feels so shoot to me and that weird... As I think Barks was correct that the ending is is very moral.

522
00:41:53,948 --> 00:42:02,936
We don't really know how he was going to ended it originally, but apparently, it was a bit more of a cynical ending, and I think the witch met more of a graphic

523
00:42:03,316 --> 00:42:03,516
demise.

524
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:07,391
Well, you know how Disney villains can never actually

525
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:08,751
do anything

526
00:42:09,212 --> 00:42:22,277
worse than fall to their death. Right? Like, they don't ever get stabbed. They don't ever get beat up or shot or anything. They just fall off of cliffs or roofs or... Yeah. They're very good at Mountains

527
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,148
Yeah.

528
00:42:23,587 --> 00:42:46,054
So it seems, you know, it's it's more passive and kind of off screen. Right? Yeah. It clearly has editor or reminded you know, This is Disney, that's we do. So the community feels about the same. You know, they're fairly indifferent to this one. It has a a seven point rating, which is like average. It's good for the six and six

529
00:42:46,393 --> 00:42:55,488
best story. Out of the forty two thousand or so that have been voted upon. So, yeah. Kind of a weird little story. Some of the elements

530
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,532
do pull me out of it, but... But it's still a fun read.

531
00:43:00,069 --> 00:43:09,050
As far as, you know, what's dated, what's our k, you know, I had fun talking about some of those old tropes of walking past the the broadcasts.

532
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:14,173
It feels like some of the gender added tubes are a little bit retro grade,

533
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,844
you know, but but nothing is like overt.

534
00:43:17,381 --> 00:43:23,883
I guess nothing nothing made me cringe in this one. Yeah. You know, I it was it was very

535
00:43:24,422 --> 00:43:24,922
trope,

536
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:26,520
but it wasn't

537
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:27,559
necessarily

538
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:33,243
as cliche shade as others have been or Al dated or as

539
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:39,562
offensive as some stories from that time period could be? Right. Yeah. So way a go.

540
00:43:40,655 --> 00:43:42,354
It was just very average.

541
00:43:42,693 --> 00:43:47,308
And and as far as I'm aware, this is not one that gets referenced

542
00:43:47,647 --> 00:44:04,737
anywhere else. Sparks didn't do an oil painting that I'm aware of. But in search I did find another painter who did one in the bark style that I thought was really cool. Guy named John Ga. So that's worth checking out. And this was never used as, like, the inspiration of a Ducktales

543
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:10,391
episode or anything like that. And and I wouldn't say that there's really any educational value

544
00:44:10,966 --> 00:44:12,876
of notes to this did

545
00:44:13,335 --> 00:44:21,119
did you have a favorite panel that's stuck out to you Sarah, a favorite page or panel, I guess? You know, it wasn't

546
00:44:21,697 --> 00:44:22,197
necessarily

547
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:23,633
a visual

548
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:27,505
thing that stuck out to me, but I really

549
00:44:27,922 --> 00:44:28,422
enjoyed

550
00:44:28,776 --> 00:44:37,510
how the cabin up on the top of the mountain was referred to as a sinister s. Yeah. Yeah. That is fun. And I do like that.

551
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:44,597
I had mentioned that I enjoyed the, you know, the machinery that she turned into as well as the

552
00:44:45,336 --> 00:44:46,475
creepy ingredients.

553
00:44:47,253 --> 00:45:06,557
The pile of Christmas trees at the end was definitely fun. That's certainly meant to be the show list of the panels. But I also really liked how even though she's just like a formed gas cam. There's there's one page where you can really kinda see the witch the which is

554
00:45:06,897 --> 00:45:15,182
despair. As a can of gas. And I I know It's that's some skill to to portray emotions through a gas.

555
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:37,504
Right. It's that second last page, the fourth panel on that one. I thought that was that was funny. Alright. So any any closing thoughts about the Golden Christmas tree? Nope. I did have a question about this this reprint that you sent to me. Yeah. It on that first page, it said published by So and so, blah blah blah in

556
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,936
subsidiary of walt, Disney company,

557
00:45:40,274 --> 00:45:43,780
Bob Blah Bank. Mh. Blah blah blah. Blah blah blah.

558
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,095
Do you have any address changes,

559
00:45:46,552 --> 00:45:50,604
send them to this post office box in Prescott, Arizona.

560
00:45:52,077 --> 00:45:57,256
Do you know when that's about being as how both of us have lived in Arizona

561
00:45:57,637 --> 00:46:01,787
and probably been... You've been a press get right Those definitely.

562
00:46:02,284 --> 00:46:13,044
Yeah. So glad stone or another rainbow or one of the publishers. You know, the this at this point walt Disney themselves have taken Al license back for the publishing,

563
00:46:13,421 --> 00:46:17,621
but the company before and the company after is called Gladstone

564
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:25,713
not to be confused with Gladstone gander. And they were ahead headquartered and and what I thought of at the time as prescott Arizona.

565
00:46:26,307 --> 00:46:26,627
And

566
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:50,081
I would tell my parents, you know, can we go to prescott Arizona someday. I wanna see where my favorite comic book are published. And and I subscribed or bought some back issues at one point. So one of the very first letters that I ever wrote was a dress. To to prescott it Arizona as it's properly called. Yeah. I'm sure it's some non office building there. But

567
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:56,562
in my eight year old mind, Prescott Arizona is the magical place that Disney comics came from. Alright.

568
00:46:57,415 --> 00:47:07,189
Thank you very much, Sarah for joining me. And I will see you back next time I think when we get to talk about race to the south seas.

569
00:47:08,485 --> 00:47:09,344
If any listeners

570
00:47:09,962 --> 00:47:10,981
