Awesome. Thank you guys. So much for joining me. I really appreciate you guys making time for

10
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:31,214
both of you letting your kids no doubt like, your walls or probably just covered with markers right now. I'll send you a bill.

11
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:39,279
We're gonna be talking about a Carl Barks classic today. We're be talking about land of the p Inducks.

12
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:41,897
And you guys are both definitely

13
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:48,305
Barks newbie right, Ryan, I've had you on for quite a few of these episodes

14
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:49,863
and...

15
00:01:50,322 --> 00:02:03,217
You're you're a big comic book fan. In general. Yeah. I probably gotten you to read the in the double digits of these at this point or or something close to it. And any thoughts on Barks and and the Ducktales story so far.

16
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:08,551
Yeah. I mean, it's... I think it's largely what I expected, kind of some

17
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:10,523
adventure

18
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:14,770
and exploring the world. I mean, I'm I'm kinda curious, you know, you like,

19
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:16,467
I would

20
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:31,995
I would probably rant about these all through high school while you were generally reading comics like x men. I guess, kinda of my question would be did is your expectation of what these comments would be like, kind of match your first impressions?

21
00:02:32,355 --> 00:03:02,353
No. I remember. I remember... And I can't remember any specific examples. But I remember, like, the duck cartoon show going pretty big for kids shows at the time and having some kind of major swatch buck adventures or, like, Indiana Jones, kind of adventures or whatever and payroll and and and that sort of thing. I feel like the tone of the comics is pretty consistent with you know, a lot of the, you know, Disney shorts and and other things that I remember from from when I was a kid right on. And and sue, I had you on,

22
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:18,694
I think around this time last year, you did a a pretty notable donald Inducks story called land of the tote poles. So Think it's gonna be interesting to kinda compare, you know, Barks stream and a native Americans in that one versus this one. Do you have any kind of initial thoughts

23
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:20,814
how they compared to each other.

24
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:27,694
I feel like that this one is... He was using... He was using the Inducks as as the like, antagonists

25
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:44,185
In the other and the other one, and I don't feel like they're an antagonist diagnostic forced in this in this comic. I feel like they're... I don't know. Maybe c protagonists because they're they're not... They're not men. They're not, like, gonna roast him over the fire or whatever they we're gonna do in the last one I can't remember.

26
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:53,620
And and he made them... He made them little even though there are no big news in North America. And I and I I have to assume that that was on purpose.

27
00:03:54,075 --> 00:04:06,710
So that they wouldn't be men? I don't know. Yeah. That's a really good point. That's something that people will will kinda of remark on about Barks big, you know, adventures where the Inducks will kind of stumble into a lost

28
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:07,750
civilization

29
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,986
is is that in a lot of their stories, you know, the Inducks are smaller than a lot of the characters

30
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:17,987
and and that's some of the men. So So Barks when he wants them to

31
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:23,655
sometimes he'll kind of turn the tables and they'll have the little creatures that the Ducktales

32
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:36,764
discover, be much smaller than them. So that they are a kind of the menace. And, you know, we see that in in this one, we saw it in the mystery of the swamp, the the earlier sort of telling of this story

33
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:41,491
very famously and, like, laminate brown. Terri and the fermi.

34
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:56,590
There there a number of stories where he's gonna do this. And so you're you're not like a common book fan in general. Right? No. I don't read a lot of comments. I read a lot of stories, but not a lot of come. I want that Ryan Sc Al me and that you suck at me.

35
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:08,305
Right. Awesome. But but you're a big reader otherwise. Are you by chance familiar with with Long fellow and the Hi alaska, the Famous I lot the story. No.

36
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:22,670
That's okay. There's... I I would say it's not very relevant today, but it is kind of a it's a semi classic of American literature or or or poetry. That that's pretty important to this one. So

37
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:27,972
I could tell they were referencing something, and I'm like, I don't know that one. So... Yeah. I

38
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:34,451
two different times in the story. I noticed Yeah. And and we'll we'll definitely talk about Hi

39
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:49,854
because that was really important. It's it's one of those things I'm really fascinated by stuff from Aries different era of American pop culture that was really big and then kind of just fell off the face of the art. Right? And like, Hi

40
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:55,714
was just huge in though like, a big part of the early twentieth century

41
00:05:56,091 --> 00:06:06,823
kind of in the way that, like, just wild west shows and less, you know, we're really popular from, like, say, the twenties through the sixties and then and then just basically utterly

42
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:07,742
disappear.

43
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:31,267
And and I don't... Alright. So a a disclaimer is is pretty important, right, for this one. So I'm I'm gonna lay out my cards a little bit. I I have a deep emotional attachment to this story. I really like this one. I I think it's a very good good very well whole Barks story, but it's definitely a big time capsule. Right? There there a lot of attitudes and

44
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:47,395
a lot of terminology towards native Americans that we definitely wouldn't use today. They're they were very run of the mail at the at the time in nineteen fifty seven when Barks wrote this, you know, they were very expected. The some of the terminology...

45
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:55,112
You know, they're they're gonna use the he's gonna use... He's gonna have the docs use the the r word that that is used

46
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:58,141
to describe Indians a few times

47
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:02,875
you know, and and and we won't be using that. It's the one that the Washington

48
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,370
baseball team football team but the Washington

49
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,130
football team goes for.

50
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,090
That the Washington

51
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:19,255
football team used to be called. They also... I mean, they use the term pig me when is kind of like a marginal word as far as, like, whether it's a pe,

52
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:33,081
And and I think the general style guide says that, like, if you're using it to refer to, like, the actual people in Central and Southern Africa, then it's acceptable, but, like, if you're using it to demonstrate people,

53
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:43,175
there's a lot of people who aren't comfortable with that. So I I mean, I'm gonna use that term because it's in the title. The land of the ping, but I'm not gonna use it a whole lot.

54
00:07:43,574 --> 00:08:06,853
Savage is another of those words that is like, big majority of nowadays and we'll kinda use that sparingly, I think. So just just know that if we if we say anything like that, we're using it descriptive in reference to the story. But you guys can basically get your own comfort level. Right? So the the story that we're talking about today, end of the P Inducks

55
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:10,309
is one that was first published

56
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:17,194
in April nineteen fifty seven, at least that was a cover date. And we're up to Scrooge number eighteen.

57
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:19,030
This one has been

58
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:25,273
reprinted to a decent number of times that ten in the United States And it's a relatively

59
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:30,267
long Barks story for for this era. It's it's twenty seven pages.

60
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:37,759
It's not up to, like, the thirty two pages that some of these earlier ones were. But it's on the longer side. It's it's quite dense.

61
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:47,745
I will say, I did not count the pages, but hearing you, say it was twenty seven is kind of surprising to me. I actually thought it was probably thirty thirty five pages.

62
00:08:48,539 --> 00:09:06,319
So this one felt kind of long to you. Did it did feel long and like didn't drag to you? A little bit. I think I think the pacing was a little slow, but that's not that's that's something I expect from from this era? I I know modern stories and modern comics can't get away with leisure pacing

63
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:14,669
anymore. And so I think it just feels slow because we're used to a faster pace market. Yeah. That's interesting. So I mentioned...

64
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:17,181
I mentioned the song of High.

65
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:25,126
That one, that one is really important to to understanding this story. Henry W long fellow as a poets

66
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:39,439
in... And and in eighteen fifty five. He put out this like, epic poem, the tail of High loss thought, the song of Hi, which was a very sympathetic tale of Native Americans, and it kind of matched up all of these

67
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:51,875
native legends that he he learned about, you know, directly from native. So you said. And and the weird thing about it, the notable thing is that he wrote it in Tropes archaic pent.

68
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,115
Do you guys...

69
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:54,835
That is the stun.

70
00:09:55,215 --> 00:10:07,743
Okay it it is. It was very much a stunned, and and he did it because it was supposed to kind of mimic Indian Native of American chanting or song. Right, the kind of stereotype

71
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:13,137
of the chance. And, apparently, he was a big admire of the Ka,

72
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:16,270
the the very famous finish

73
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,890
epic poem that is, like the fit the national Story of Finland.

74
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,070
And you of you guys heard about the Ka?

75
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,358
No. I have not heard of this. Well, you you are not good things because everything

76
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,273
knows the Ka.

77
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:32,907
I don't even know what you would compare it to

78
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:45,363
to for for another country. It is like, the finish. I and I'm mentioning it because down the rug, Don Rose is gonna do a big light story where he to the entire country of Finland, which famously

79
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,520
likes

80
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:57,980
the dot com more per capita than just about anyone else. So is about, like, the the founding of the country? Is it, like a the origin myth? I mean, it's... It it goes back.

81
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:06,285
Very far. But I I think I... It's been a while since I read anything either about the poem or or Roses tail of C.

82
00:11:07,158 --> 00:11:09,853
I'm I'm I'm showing my ignorance

83
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:22,836
of anything beyond really the title and the fact that they used that that type meter. But but apparently, that was a more common, like, that's more appropriate and finish because it matches the language.

84
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:34,028
And he was like widely der divided. Right? This poem was mocked. When it came out. They're all these scathing reviews And then today, we're like, well, this is, like really...

85
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:35,984
It's very little.

86
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,790
It's it's very, like noble savage trope

87
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:47,372
today. So... But it had this, like, sweet spot this golden age. And and in the late thirties, Disney released this Cartoon

88
00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:48,544
called

89
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:57,150
Little ohio Watson. Does that ring a bell for either of you? Oh, that does ring a bell. Yeah. Yeah. Well let let me just I'm gonna show you...

90
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,670
I'll I'll share just really quickly Al image because

91
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,470
if if you grew up in the eighties, this was kind of still Ryan

92
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:07,957
something that you would have expected

93
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:12,437
to know. It would have been run. I don't know if that looks familiar. Oh, yeah.

94
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:41,175
Yeah. So this animated short was really, really big. It became big in, like, Disney comments because they adapted the Disney common. So so these comments were running for a while before Barks, you know, at least a decade before barb put out this story. So that the high lock the stories really did inspire this and and it was really big and pop culture, and weirdly the Europeans loved the high. Stories as well into the, like, two thousands.

95
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:44,820
I think it's the problem with the Indian, like, stories,

96
00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:46,397
and pop culture

97
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:49,703
Either they're very, like, wild west, cowboys and,

98
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:52,616
very directly racist tropes.

99
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:56,404
Or they treat Inducks as, like characters.

100
00:12:56,822 --> 00:13:03,350
Right? Not as real people. Yeah. I I know I know... I mean, I knew growing up in the Us that that

101
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:06,519
European had a fascination with the natives

102
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:18,879
because they don't really have native. They are the natives in Europe. You know what I mean? Yeah. And so having having an ancient culture that that you happen upon, you know, in fairly recent history and and and everything is,

103
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:30,690
you know, kind of exciting to them. Right. Right. And and we're not a immune to that. Right? Because, like, we have tons of that this this like, Noble Indian trope. Which is what Barks is really gonna lean into.

104
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,114
In this one. It's it's a different kind of...

105
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:43,099
It it's a different sort of problematic treatment. Like, on it face. Yeah. It looks like he's being much kinder to to the natives.

106
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:51,698
You know. This story compared to, like, land the tote bulls But, like, are they even real people in this that they're they're really not? No. He's totally

107
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:52,857
like, in

108
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:58,784
them. They're just they're... And part of that is because they're little. You know what I mean? It's easier. It's easier to...

109
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:05,875
They're they're not real people. They're they're fun little characters. And when we were kids, like, the biggest movies were last of the Mo

110
00:14:06,214 --> 00:14:08,975
and dances with wolves. And right now,

111
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,250
avatar the way of water is making a million dollars.

112
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,810
Guys

113
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,590
they're not native Americans. They're aliens Barks. It has nothing to do with native Americans.

114
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:30,774
I did see it. I took... I took my my daughter. I took me Al a see it over winter break. And and we had a good time, you know? Because it's some in press spec and three d.

115
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:35,359
But as you say, Avatar is all about this, like, native peoples

116
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:59,515
connected to the Lands stroke and And like, if you don't read what modern natives have to say about this on its face, it might seem okay. This is very noble to is a very positive stereotype, but let's sue, you said the word in infant. That's the word that was on the tip of my brain. It doesn't go into kind of the complex city of either ancient Indian life or modern Indian life.

117
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:00,715
It's very

118
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:16,435
simplistic. Yes. Native were like probably more in touch with the land and in their environment, but, like, we don't really recognize how how they were managing it actively it. It really does a disservice to just turn them into these characters.

119
00:15:17,175 --> 00:15:26,892
So so that's some of the caveats, and that's some of the things that, like, make it... That that makes it hard for me to revisit this story in the same way that I enjoyed it as an I year. Right?

120
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:32,392
But but I do think that there is a lot to really like about this story

121
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:35,122
and it and it really has to do with Barks

122
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:37,116
characterization of Scrooge

123
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:54,345
and some of his moral complexity in this one that's really fascinated. Barb got really at at some point, I mean, I'm gonna say it was in about nineteen fifty seven. At some point, he turned very up ecological minded in a way that is surprising.

124
00:15:54,998 --> 00:16:01,564
To me, you know, for a man, he he was fifty six years old at this point. He was living in San Justin,

125
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:02,700
California,

126
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:12,348
where he had kind of, like, gone out to to have his own pocket with the... With clean air that didn't, you know, bother his didn't bother his asthma.

127
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:14,905
But I think he kind of felt...

128
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:21,953
Ryan, you can probably relate to this Al as someone who grew up in California with me. He felt civilization encroaching

129
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:34,940
the pollution was, like, the environmental movement was really getting going in the late fifties. And it's really interesting. This is the first story where he really leans into this kind of message of conservation. Yeah.

130
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,540
A lot of what you just said is depicted in the very first frame.

131
00:16:39,234 --> 00:16:46,185
Yeah. Yeah, he's he's shouting in a real estate man. And then in the background, you can see just just smokes stacks.

132
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:48,218
Buff

133
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,296
who knows what into the air

134
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:56,225
across the whole horizon. And and the real estate man has... Even has an Al next to him that says

135
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:58,862
Shaq and San jack, nine thousand

136
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:02,179
c. I don't know. Maybe that's the currency in Duck...

137
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:07,066
It's funny that San sent gets gets called out in the first frame.

138
00:17:07,523 --> 00:17:12,228
Yeah. Yeah. He he gets a kick out of putting occasional references to his hometown.

139
00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:21,075
In here. And and... Yeah, like, it's... And this is before the clean... The, you know, the all the laws that came about in the late sixties

140
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:44,045
for for a period of time, like, American pollution was really bad too. So it's something we're always dealing with, but but it's actually gotten a lot better Yeah. I think Clean air act is nineteen seventy two. I wanna say... Yeah. Yeah. You're right. Later part of them. Barks back there in the early seventies. That's right. So, you know, yeah, fifty sixties, it would have been that it's peak, you know, where you can

141
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:53,654
light your local river on fire, light your tap water on fire. Right. Yeah. The C Guy, I guess wouldn't have been too far away from where from where this took place.

142
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:56,387
And and again, I mentioned that he

143
00:17:56,939 --> 00:18:04,871
ecological mine that's something that's really interested in me. Interested me about Barks because, like he's he's very economically

144
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,785
conservative comes out in a lot of these stories.

145
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:09,725
But he's a bit of a hippie

146
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:10,965
and is later

147
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:12,285
in his later...

148
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:21,271
That's probably a simplification But, like, his last several stories are gonna be these junior chat stories that are that are Scrooge

149
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,260
against pollution and have the

150
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:32,055
how Scrooge cast Al kind of a villain. So it's just gonna be really interesting to see kind of the contrast between Scrooge,

151
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:36,325
as the person who like brought about all this environmental

152
00:18:36,704 --> 00:18:37,204
degradation

153
00:18:37,543 --> 00:18:38,342
to Ducktales

154
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:45,642
than than wanting to scape it. And and I find this to be a very interesting morally complex story,

155
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:58,364
especially with the great running gag. Of of him just never being able to get it off his mine. He can't turn off the the exploitation lens. He just he's like, Oh, I could make money off of this and enough of this something.

156
00:18:59,081 --> 00:18:59,480
Right.

157
00:18:59,998 --> 00:19:07,060
And and for me, that bit is is is Riot. I love it. I I as I was researching some people kind of were like,

158
00:19:07,840 --> 00:20:12,705
this running gag gets played a little bit into the ground. So I'm curious is to let you guys think of it, but I but I'm I'm there for it the whole way through. I liked it. I I didn't think it got old because it's so in character, like Right. I I don't know. If he had tried to do that with another character, but it's it's screwed. He has a money pig. He's got a whole doll where he dies Inducks money. Of course, he can't turn it off. Right. Right. Yeah. No. I think I think it's a great... I think it's a great character b. One of Barks good quotes about this one was Well, first off, so he noted that the Ducktales docks themselves were always pee in comparison with the villains. In order of them to become a menace. They had to come up against somebody's smaller. And then his kind of, like, reason behind this story, he said clean air, clean water, clean environment. We think of those things as part of our birth birthright. They once were a long ago before we overrun them with our brand of civilization now would be a air so polluted that we have to grind it before it will filter through our gas masks water saw drinkable that is safer to die of thirst.

159
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:46,505
Environment so liter that we cannot see the ground and ground so positive with chemical spills that eat through the soul of our shoes and quiet who knows what that is anymore. So we dream that somewhere in the boom knobs, we can find a place that is still Al clean as nature intended but if we find such a place, would be safe to move in. Uncle Scrooge tries and this tail of the oxygen belt and finds that his kind and our kind are mighty darned unavailable I I mean, that that in and of itself is pretty poetic. So I think that was from some of his correspondence

160
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:52,603
with Jeffrey Blu and the age it's a it's a great selection of this story. So you guys let's...

161
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,577
Before we get into the story

162
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:55,905
itself, let's

163
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:59,492
take a moment to hand to my international

164
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:00,608
listeners.

165
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:09,832
I like to check in on how these stories get titled around the world. Sometimes it's really interesting because, like, story titles don't work in other languages.

166
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:18,505
And then sometimes they just kinda straight up translate salmon. And that's mostly the case here. You will see that most of the stories

167
00:21:19,002 --> 00:21:26,061
it's just land of the Hidden Inducks or land of the North Indian But but here and there, it's it's a little bit different. So

168
00:21:26,678 --> 00:21:32,242
sue do you wanna kick us off? Sure. Okay. In Brazil, both Inducks non.

169
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:33,910
The run Inducks.

170
00:21:34,348 --> 00:21:39,845
Yeah. So slight variation on the theme. What did you... Which one did you wanna cover, Ryan? I'll do it good.

171
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:45,044
Big In the land of the Pink Inducks.

172
00:21:45,602 --> 00:21:50,224
Yep. Very nice And that leaves me with the the tricky one, which is Danish.

173
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,374
So in Denmark, this was a

174
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:54,867
Inducks.

175
00:21:56,103 --> 00:22:00,785
It's var in the Indiana land. In the land of the dwarf Inducks.

176
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,362
That's

177
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,330
that was the mouthful. Alright. So let's see.

178
00:22:06,944 --> 00:22:15,376
I think I'm ready to dive into this one And then I guess I'll know This is one definitely one of the earlier Scrooge

179
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:26,914
adventures. That I ever read. I think I had this at eighty nine. It was probably among the first twenty or thirty of these stories. And and Ryan, you had alluded to the opening of this one.

180
00:22:27,332 --> 00:22:42,403
I I usually say that a story has a strong opening because he's usually very good about opening his stories with a a great representation of the characters. But I think this one is especially strong because it it just... There is so much messaging

181
00:22:43,115 --> 00:22:50,055
loaded into this first panel of him approaching really w Scrooge is w at Sidewalk

182
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:52,495
sam, the real estate man

183
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,570
And and he is complaining about wanting to leave Inducks

184
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,110
with its smog and noise

185
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:16,195
that he wants a home far out in the wild. And as you say, Ryan, we see all these smokes stacks in the background and and sign up Sam himself is one of these like characters that Barks will pull out occasionally where he's just this bit character who only appears

186
00:23:16,534 --> 00:23:17,433
for a page

187
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:21,941
and and change. But to me is very memorable. He's this, like

188
00:23:22,518 --> 00:23:28,700
very well designed Shady real estate guy who's sitting in an unusually low share

189
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:36,165
with up with a. He's got this weird just position where he's like dress very fancy, but he's, like, operating off Al, like,

190
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:37,465
storefront

191
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:45,616
in in the way that a real estate agent definitely would not jumping on a cigar. To me, he looks like W c fields.

192
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:50,351
And you guys have any thoughts about sidewalk Sam himself? I think

193
00:23:51,063 --> 00:24:00,110
I think, you know, he's just... He's just in a Al a low chair on the sidewalk in front of his shop there. And he just has like notices, paper notices,

194
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:08,524
mailed up or pinned or something to the outside of the building, and Scrooge just walks up and and buys this huge property from him on the sidewalk

195
00:24:10,378 --> 00:24:15,427
in Ducktales, and I think I think it kind of is meant to... I think it helps accent

196
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:30,565
one of the themes of the story of just kind of how preposterous it is that two rich white dudes in some distant lands can can pull out a map and, like, draw a square and be like you own this now, and I need it now.

197
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:47,800
They've they've never been there. They... You know, they have connection to the land. They have no answer ancestry through there. They don't speak the language of the people who live there. They just draw line and they go This is this is this is who owns it now. We have decided the ownership of this, and it's like, who are you?

198
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:53,035
It reminds me, it reminds me of, like, you know, the Shady guy on the streets in New York selling

199
00:24:53,611 --> 00:25:02,623
boot like Dvds. Watches. Yeah. Yes. It's like This is not mine, but I'm selling it to you. Sort of deal. Yeah. That's that's what get from sidewalks.

200
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,715
Maybe in the guy who sells the Brooklyn bridge to you.

201
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:15,825
And, yeah, that's that's especially true, Ryan. This is a great supporting of the the theme itself of the story this this

202
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:26,918
on its face of it, like, this is kind of the this is the dis of some of the problems of monitoring capitalism. Right? This ownership of land this this distraction of everything

203
00:25:27,455 --> 00:25:33,360
of value. And and, boy, I love that second panel where Sam is kind of leaning over.

204
00:25:34,055 --> 00:25:36,115
And and his his cigar,

205
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:46,759
the smokes stack in the background, it almost looks like it's coming out from his cigar. It's an neat little touch and he, Just physician. And he he casually

206
00:25:47,376 --> 00:25:56,125
sells Scrooge a plot of of a thousand lakes that he said are in the region north of Lakes superior.

207
00:25:56,843 --> 00:25:59,830
So so we're just just north, I guess, if of

208
00:26:00,247 --> 00:26:02,182
Minnesota into Southern Canada

209
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:17,915
in a part that is was pretty wild and and still is pretty wild. Famously called land end of a thousand late There's a there's a funny little bit where Scrooge says he'll Sam is referenced to how many acres and Scrooge says he'll take a thousand, but he means a thousand lakes.

210
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:19,467
And so

211
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:49,485
on on the next page, as screws draws out the deal with Sam, he gets a a rei reassurance from him. So do you wanna tell us about the the assurance that he gets from him. Oh, yeah. No. He's he's trying to make sure there's no people. There's nobody there, not even the Inducks and sidewalk sam is very confident. That's right. You'll have the whole place to yourself, which, you know, we we know from the title that's not the case. So that's gonna be a phone's price frame him later. Right. Right. And and and it's ridiculous. Right? He

212
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:52,725
sidewalk sam can say whatever Huey, wants. And so

213
00:26:53,505 --> 00:27:01,684
we get this neat little sequence of Scrooge kind of pondering how excited he is to leave the smoke and smog of duck.

214
00:27:02,835 --> 00:27:11,686
But there's a real contradiction there. He's he says I'm through with it. Even though I am the guy that started all of those smelly

215
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:12,225
industry.

216
00:27:13,118 --> 00:27:17,845
And and boy, that's a stark thing to say, right? To want to

217
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:25,136
to want to develop all of this stuff and then when it's too much, Scrooge is not considering, like, cleaning it up.

218
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:31,156
Or dis dismantling it. He he just wants to leave it. Yeah. He's he's still making money from it. Certainly.

219
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:38,030
Right. You wanna impact that. And so he's coming to you. We we see him grab donald than the nephews.

220
00:27:38,584 --> 00:27:42,154
Who are... They're an interesting role in this, because they're largely

221
00:27:42,531 --> 00:28:10,783
comp and what he's doing here. Right? He's gonna take them along to look for a a good location to bring him, and I think he allude to moving his money in there. They they they board a neat looking sea plain and he talks about how he brought plenty of equipment for having fun, hunting and fishing. And and sue what is Scrooge is definition of hunting and efficient. I hello. I love that you something he's something gold, silver, nickel copper, what else? Would you want?

222
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:27,980
Right. Right. So it's just it's just mining equipment. It's a great character beat. It's a great guy, and he is gonna go back to that well quite a bit. And and so we transition pretty quickly to this land of a thousand lakes. I really like the landscape

223
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,794
that's that

224
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:37,346
straws in this story guys. I think it's really beautiful. The the wilderness and the animals are all drawn in a really neat way.

225
00:28:38,477 --> 00:28:44,278
The docs land in in a hooks shape or new near a Home shape hook shaped Lake

226
00:28:44,774 --> 00:28:49,122
that kind of is the guy for where his plot of land is And basically

227
00:28:49,501 --> 00:28:51,080
throughout the next pages

228
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:57,486
as they're exploring the property, we're gonna have this kind of like running theme

229
00:28:57,825 --> 00:29:08,202
running gag going on that we've mentioned a little bit, but Ryan, do you wanna tell us what's basically gonna be happening during this stan. Oh, as he's looking at the natural beauty, he is

230
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,439
imagining all of the

231
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:12,930
resources that he can extract out of it. He can

232
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:23,904
turn the timber and paper. He he sees a moose and he wants to sell some move mistakes back in the in the duck oh in the New York Barks. Right right. So like everything

233
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:38,063
here. Everything that he sees is just g for his industry. And and he cannot help himself. Did you wants the model the? Model the air. Yeah. Yes. He even references

234
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:41,514
bottle the air and selling it

235
00:29:42,332 --> 00:29:43,211
back Inducks.

236
00:29:43,611 --> 00:29:45,349
It it is pretty.

237
00:29:45,728 --> 00:30:06,273
It's it's a little bit over the top. It's pretty funny. Yeah. So... And and then we get the Inducks kind of, like, talking about how, you know, it's fortunate that there's nobody that lives there. So they're they're gonna leave all of that stuff. They're playing, their camp. The whole time they're gonna be leaving it unattended And they see this bra moose

238
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,665
at some point. And

239
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:09,981
their...

240
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:13,345
The reader is gonna get this kind of ominous

241
00:30:13,885 --> 00:30:22,957
view of the moose that the Inducks don't get. So do you wanna tell us about that moose? Yeah. No. I really really loved this like visual

242
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:35,098
for foreshadowing and kind of like, they're just talking about how there's nobody around, but on the other backside side of the moose, the move is built up on a platform with a little ladder up to it. It looks like a little spy hole and

243
00:30:35,797 --> 00:30:38,810
I like... I I liked it. That it was funny. Right.

244
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:44,010
Exactly. It's our... It's our. First hints that there are in fact humans here.

245
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:56,175
But but they must be fairly small and and it Al echoes an early gag and mystery of the swamp, Ryan that very weird story with the measles

246
00:30:56,593 --> 00:31:01,940
where we got a similar view of an alligator that has little nasal fee good fee. Oh, yes.

247
00:31:02,952 --> 00:31:22,191
Running running beneath it. So this was his... I think this was the first time that he did this type of story remake Most people would say that this one is much much stronger that he kinda refined this story and that it's better than the mystery of the small. I myself love mystery of the swamp because it's just so weird,

248
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,946
but I I can't help but agree that this this is just generally a better story

249
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,817
overall. So, the the whole way Scrooge

250
00:31:31,216 --> 00:31:31,716
cannot

251
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:39,005
shut up about the the kind of resource extraction that he would love to do. And and we see the nephews.

252
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:40,085
He be doing

253
00:31:40,385 --> 00:31:52,823
kind of spa. I I hope on the Scrooge will leave this country clean and free for the animals and birds. He alone can decide that, you know, because he has that deed from Sidewalk sam.

254
00:31:54,035 --> 00:31:57,815
And and we get to their campsite site, and this is a direct

255
00:31:58,635 --> 00:32:03,710
redo of where how they camp when they were in the gl in mystery of the swamp

256
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,450
They don't secure anything Scrooge

257
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,230
is seeing like platinum

258
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:14,245
and so forth. And and when they wake up in the morning, Ryan, do you wanna tell us what they find.

259
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:28,100
All their stuff has been rec up. Everything's all, you know, their supplies and stove and everything have been thrown into the the hooks shaped like, around them. And as they're looking around to try and figure out Al some tracks or something, maybe an animal did this,

260
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,811
Scrooge is just checking out the minerals in the ground to to see if there's any valuable minerals.

261
00:32:34,547 --> 00:32:36,442
Right. Right. You even as

262
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:43,660
even as he's supposed to be kind of investigating for what's been going on. He can't help himself.

263
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:57,936
It's interesting to think, right? Like, did was Scrooge always like this? Did his, like, hunt for wealth kind of like, per preferred him into this. Don Rose is gonna do some stories later on and especially in his life and times of Scrooge.

264
00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:01,604
Like, young Scrooge stories where he kind of references

265
00:33:01,943 --> 00:33:07,531
that that change in Scrooge and show screws tiny for the days when you could look at something.

266
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:19,108
As a beautiful natural feature instead of like, resource extraction. You guys, I love the the very well timed Joke. That they have with the moose

267
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:32,386
where where they're puzzling over onto the next page here, they're puzzling over you know, who could have taken this? What could have happened because raiders would come by canoe and Canoe don't make tracks

268
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:42,662
And and then we cut immediately to their canoe floating away, and an nephew who says ours does, I I really like that. I I think that's very funny.

269
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:59,781
And and when they go to check it, thinking that they've figured out the mystery, they realized, oh, it's just... It's just a dogg on wandering moose But, of course, the reader knows that most likely, it is the... It is the hidden little characters that are stealing it away and disguise.

270
00:34:00,235 --> 00:34:02,215
And and the docs get their first

271
00:34:02,595 --> 00:34:03,095
direct

272
00:34:03,515 --> 00:34:13,098
intuition of of who is men them. Sued do you wanna tell us when they approach a a little visual sign. Yeah. They've got a little tree there, and it's got

273
00:34:13,436 --> 00:34:24,800
an arrow tied to the tree and the error was pointing to a branch that is just holding an egg and I think I think the the nephews do they... Do they pull up their, like, little wood both?

274
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:25,896
Oh, this means.

275
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:36,644
Go back where you came from. Right. It's it's a pretty obvious. It's it's a bla siren of a sign. Right? I don't know that anyone would really need to interpret that way.

276
00:34:36,984 --> 00:34:40,321
But it then it feels very clever to me. And I like...

277
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:48,417
I guess it's worth noting too that a lot of the stuff that is like, native in this or Indian and this really is Inducks.

278
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:51,228
Right? He's gonna use... He's gonna kinda

279
00:34:51,725 --> 00:34:54,153
all these Indian tropes the way that every

280
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:10,801
everyone did throughout the entirety of the nineteen fifties. And so, yeah, It's a sign that says go back where you came from and and sp is outraged, and he's gonna let out with a no savages can do this to me on my land. I'll start charging them rent.

281
00:35:11,973 --> 00:35:14,107
So so screws is is pretty

282
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:16,439
throughout most of this story.

283
00:35:17,276 --> 00:35:20,527
He... I mean, he's used the villain of this story

284
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,739
very arguably.

285
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:23,113
Yeah. Definitely. Yeah.

286
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:28,040
No question. And and we get this this funny little gag

287
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:37,313
where Donald, you know, he he's like, hey, this egg might be years old. I'm gonna inspect it to make sure it's fresh. And then the very predictable thing happens,

288
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:43,078
tiny little arrow fires through the egg in a perfect bit of comment tied, timing,

289
00:35:43,736 --> 00:35:47,211
sp it on him, and he says it was today's egg thank goodness.

290
00:35:48,305 --> 00:35:58,891
It's it's cute. It's predictable but I liked it. Yeah. I thought it was cool. I thought it was a Clever Donald to think of, you know, is this something someone left twenty years ago, or or is this a message for us?

291
00:35:59,711 --> 00:36:06,099
Right. And and so the next a couple of pages are devoted to this sequence that is going to...

292
00:36:06,756 --> 00:36:10,906
It's gonna gradually hint at the size of the Inducks. Right?

293
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:16,487
And and it's going to be, like, it's gonna kind of show us that they are men,

294
00:36:17,224 --> 00:36:22,245
but that their defense right as screws approaches them, he gets a volume of arrows

295
00:36:22,622 --> 00:36:28,041
filling his top hat, which is pretty funny. We we get a moment where the this feels

296
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:39,796
extremely awkward in two thousand twenty three, you know, as he walks back to the canoe, yelling Al then he he says I'll be back later and he calls him that our word renegade

297
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:45,039
that's an illegal defiance of a landlord. Again, a lot a lot of listeners

298
00:36:45,897 --> 00:36:56,606
are are probably listening in Europe where the more haven't, like turned as quickly but Like, we've we've been grappling with the use of that word for the last couple of decades. The last decades

299
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:58,986
in the United States,

300
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,060
and

301
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:04,927
it is just... It is now seen as a

302
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:05,964
Al ethnic

303
00:37:06,342 --> 00:37:21,505
slur and is not used anymore, but it would have been in very common use in nineteen fifty seven. And and the whole point of this sequence besides showing them as defensive as again, hint to how small they are because we see their tiny little arrows.

304
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,546
We see eventually, we see.

305
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:33,606
Again, it is Indian, so we've got we're required to have the little single feather. All in the where feathers Barks, all of them...

306
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:34,446
Yeah.

307
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:35,798
Exactly.

308
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:56,401
And and we see them unusually close together. The debts suppose that they must be running through the tall grass but but then they... As Donald fires off the shot to to flush them out. They see them moving unusually fast. This is a bit that doesn't work as well as it would if it were animated. You know? Yeah.

309
00:37:57,201 --> 00:38:09,921
And and then we get the reveal. Right, and it is supposed to be a little bit of a reveal where they they'd say, oh, don't tell me. H me Inducks. Right? I've read if had some kind of new species or whatever, like, the

310
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:11,401
Or, you know,

311
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:21,186
the measles or whoever, he likes to kind of create these new races or whatever and, like you know, These are these just kind of a native American Hobbits or something that is good.

312
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:27,461
Yeah. I think that's a good way of describing them. That's that's what they their Native American

313
00:38:27,881 --> 00:38:31,461
habits effect. I think I think it's interesting that they're

314
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:39,513
essentially humans, they're essentially pink squishy humans like us. Right. That have some kind of a doc or some kind of vague

315
00:38:39,852 --> 00:38:40,672
dog looking

316
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:41,551
person

317
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:49,961
or whatever, like, all of the occupancy of of Ducktales Right. Yeah. That's true. And and some of his earlier comics, he would

318
00:38:50,301 --> 00:38:59,645
use more human characters. And then later on, he would only make sort of these other weird races be humans. So, do you wanna describe the Kiwi guys

319
00:39:00,222 --> 00:39:05,165
for us and if you have any thoughts about them? Sure. Yeah. They're all very small, obviously.

320
00:39:05,902 --> 00:39:09,732
They're all wearing feathers as we've noted all In have more better.

321
00:39:11,105 --> 00:39:13,882
They've got, like, little tiny spears and

322
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:15,779
instead of horses, they have rapid.

323
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:17,078
Think it's

324
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:18,157
delightful.

325
00:39:19,308 --> 00:39:22,279
But, yeah. They're just... They're just very small. They have a large noses.

326
00:39:23,453 --> 00:39:26,703
Very. Yeah. Very large noses, noses is

327
00:39:27,496 --> 00:39:30,356
forty percent of their face I would say. But, yeah, that's

328
00:39:31,216 --> 00:39:34,531
leather of kind. Yeah. Yeah. They have... They'll have fringe

329
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:37,131
leather or clothing and mo.

330
00:39:37,551 --> 00:39:39,131
And in the background, I can see

331
00:39:39,831 --> 00:39:42,751
some tote poles like Pacific Northwest tribes would make.

332
00:39:43,804 --> 00:40:11,787
Right. Yeah. Do when I learned a a good bit about tote poles from doing land of the tote poles. And and as you say, that is that is a Pacific Northwest thing. Not we we definitely have some mis mismatch here. Looks like are those wig ones, I guess? Oh, yeah. Or or or would that be a mini long house? I'm not sure, but sound. But at at least it's not a great plains tip p. Yeah. Yeah. Those those tote poles came a long way to Like superior that probably.

333
00:40:13,237 --> 00:40:19,715
Yeah. And and again, he's gonna cast to the native the the little kiwi guys as they're called as very

334
00:40:20,132 --> 00:40:30,782
sympathetic. We're supposed to identify with them. They're very determined They're very brave. We see them in this in this panic So I have a question. I I wanted to know your thoughts.

335
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:33,014
They they shoot a million arrows

336
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,662
over these two pages at the docks.

337
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:50,620
But they do not actually shoot the Ducktales with an arrow. Do you think that's on purpose? Do you think they're just trying to, like, warn off the Ducktales? Or do you think it's just plot armor and our heroes never get hurt. Do you think do you think these are, you know, precision warning shots or

338
00:40:51,435 --> 00:40:52,272
clumsy shots?

339
00:40:53,483 --> 00:41:05,482
For business. You know, I I think that's a great question. I think I I think... I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, I think we've definitely got plotted armor here. Throughout. But but yeah, I think the kiwi guys are so noble

340
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:13,756
Right? They don't actually want to hurt them. They given them ample worn and, you know, they're given them this sign and tried to convince them to leave.

341
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:16,156
So I I think these are precision,

342
00:41:16,496 --> 00:41:18,376
get the heck out of here. Volumes.

343
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:22,411
I I I tend to agree with you there because the only

344
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:33,530
all the Ducktales wearing hats, but the only dog who has arrows in his hat is the bad guy. Right Like the Nephews and donald, they don't have arrows that their had. They're not the ones shouting

345
00:41:33,948 --> 00:41:34,427
seventies.

346
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:43,636
It's like have in their. They're not being shot at. It's just screwed. Yeah. They're they're very responsive to the, like, true actual

347
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:44,412
threat.

348
00:41:45,147 --> 00:41:45,647
What

349
00:41:45,986 --> 00:41:46,746
it is something.

350
00:41:47,706 --> 00:42:07,510
And and that panel with all of the Pb guys screen, that's a really cool panel. I I really like that. This is where we first encounter the kiwi guys cadence, their speech. This is something that Barks really this is unusual. Right? Because again, he did write there all of their dialogue was written

351
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:08,749
in this...

352
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:10,681
What did I say called

353
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,358
it is written in t

354
00:42:13,777 --> 00:42:14,277
hand.

355
00:42:14,976 --> 00:42:18,073
Does anyone know how to read T pen?

356
00:42:18,587 --> 00:42:19,567
Heaven's know.

357
00:42:20,947 --> 00:42:25,307
So I of course, well before researching this story.

358
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:26,760
Knew how to read

359
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:28,658
And of.

360
00:42:29,277 --> 00:42:29,777
Obviously.

361
00:42:30,236 --> 00:42:40,852
Clearly, I I did not practice this last night or any Basically, you are putting the stress on the first syllable. Right? In in in English,

362
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,547
we we have I I Al.

363
00:42:43,401 --> 00:42:46,973
Stress where we would... We would stress

364
00:42:47,630 --> 00:43:00,847
the the second syllable. So... And then you're you're doing it like every other. So so his... The the says that the chief is telling them go kiwi does from your village, flee, the mighty war, like strangers.

365
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:05,476
But it would be go kiwi guys from Your village.

366
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:14,967
Fleas mighty wore war likes. Stranger, something like that. I'm sure I'm not doing it very well, but it's that's it's got... It's definitely got this rhythm

367
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:25,760
The way you see it, it does make you wanna read it this way. So even if it... It's kind of imminent ridiculous that that Long fellow is doing this goofy

368
00:43:26,257 --> 00:43:26,757
stereotype

369
00:43:27,294 --> 00:43:27,574
thing.

370
00:43:28,132 --> 00:43:31,025
It is still really notable, and I think really interesting.

371
00:43:31,482 --> 00:43:47,590
And and definitely very poetic. In the way that Barks was was going for and Long fell was originally going for. Let's see. I have a quote about him and and doing this. He said, I came up with having the pin talk in the language of Long fellows song of Hi

372
00:43:48,326 --> 00:44:20,642
about the eighth grade I had to read and recite in school. Thought it was a very tires way of telling the story back then, but the meter lands itself very well to the conversations of the ping when they talk about what they're going to do. It gives the story a special flavor. The dialogue took longer to write than normal if it practically had to be timed with with a metro or no, I've come up with the gist of what they wanna to say, then try to figure out a way to express it in long fellows meter. So I think that's really interesting I think that's a very cool and successful part of the story. I imagine

373
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:22,715
trying to write and

374
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:24,522
also helps

375
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:25,599
the

376
00:44:25,936 --> 00:44:27,432
not sound as...

377
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:34,980
What again. What's the what's the word that I'm looking for? The land of the total pulls they found very... They use stupid. They just have

378
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:38,133
right. Right. It they use very pigeon

379
00:44:38,751 --> 00:44:40,227
English and we got a lot.

380
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,732
And and sometimes they will like, they definitely use the kind of in infant

381
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:50,022
pronouns in this, They're gonna say Right. We instead of I,

382
00:44:50,755 --> 00:44:56,677
But you're right. It does give them... It it it it makes them seem more special, definitely

383
00:44:57,293 --> 00:45:00,440
But but, again, more like a carrot or more like a hobbit

384
00:45:00,818 --> 00:45:08,756
than and a real human. And so, you know, as screwed approach is them fleeing because he wants to kind of like have a landlord

385
00:45:09,255 --> 00:45:10,314
conversation with them.

386
00:45:10,853 --> 00:45:14,469
A stray arrow from a rear guard slips down his

387
00:45:14,848 --> 00:45:15,748
his rightful

388
00:45:16,382 --> 00:45:23,462
destroying it. It's a very cool couple of panels. And and the Inducks have to flee temporarily and they're pondering what they're gonna do.

389
00:45:24,277 --> 00:45:29,777
And screws says I could go back to that land and get my money back because of that guarantee

390
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:31,677
of nobody living here.

391
00:45:32,331 --> 00:45:34,747
But he says I'm kind of taken with the possibilities.

392
00:45:35,484 --> 00:45:37,142
Ryan, do you wanna read his line

393
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,693
that's on on the sixth panel of this page in the Ka canoe besides

394
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:46,996
Besides if I could tame those little savages, they make the best dogg on pipeline cleaners than ever.

395
00:45:48,273 --> 00:45:48,353
Yeah.

396
00:45:49,151 --> 00:45:55,174
It's seen a a a dome of match gas that he knew he could tap. And you gotta... You gotta pipe that to the

397
00:45:55,512 --> 00:45:56,012
refineries

398
00:45:56,469 --> 00:46:01,416
Right. Right. And and we're not highlighting every Scrooge moments of

399
00:46:01,994 --> 00:46:08,947
noting, but you guys feel free to cut in as I skip over them because they're... They're interesting and it and it gives us a flavor.

400
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:17,246
How often they are. He does have also as he's saying this, you can see his face. He's still... He still has, like, sit on him from his exploding shotgun,

401
00:46:17,624 --> 00:46:20,057
but he has this, like, villainous a smile

402
00:46:21,357 --> 00:46:22,417
that's kind of men

403
00:46:23,397 --> 00:46:23,897
and,

404
00:46:25,037 --> 00:46:27,537
his nephews are ain't really shouting and him down.

405
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:28,412
Yeah...

406
00:46:29,532 --> 00:46:32,552
This is definitely a story. You know, I I did the great

407
00:46:32,972 --> 00:46:42,666
second richest dot is first experience meeting Flint heart, Glen, just a few episodes ago. And and the neat thing about that is you can see

408
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:49,587
long is like, is do or in this And the only thing that it Scrooge screws from descending into, like, kind of villain

409
00:46:49,966 --> 00:47:11,687
is that his nephews are around keep him in chat. So I I think they're kind of an underrated part of his character. But but if that's a pretty awful thing to say, Right? Tame them to exploit him as pipeline planners And then this this so, this is gonna be a pretty weird part of the story. I wonder if this gave you pause, the Ducktales plan,

410
00:47:12,425 --> 00:47:13,724
which is to capture.

411
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:26,332
You know, on even one of the, like, very sympathetic nephews says, we want we could capture one of little guys to get their message across to them to to them, you know, give them, like, say that they come peacefully.

412
00:47:26,632 --> 00:47:27,027
I just

413
00:47:27,647 --> 00:47:49,508
that part was weird to me. I was like, these guys have been the voice of res, and now they want to kid up somebody to tell them don't be afraid of us, that just seems like some seriously mixed messaging you guys right. And then they do can connect them they don't try to talk to them. And all they just run And I'm like, what? Where was your plan of of making this guy your in best?

414
00:47:50,164 --> 00:48:04,015
Right. I heard that. I imagine they were they were gonna get to it, but they certainly aren't in a hurry. Ryan t, do you remember this story beat from mystery of a swamp at all? And he's been a year the kid map?

415
00:48:04,434 --> 00:48:05,853
Yeah. They can have to.

416
00:48:06,711 --> 00:48:12,357
Do you remember he he... They they build this make shift cage for how many swell up. Oh, yeah.

417
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:15,849
Very weirdly. It's it's a it's one of the odd

418
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:17,782
moments in all of our stories.

419
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,374
They didn't tell his

420
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:20,867
at that point. Yes.

421
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:29,317
I I... That's the only explanation is that he really felt like okay. Once he realized because he he had a comment here

422
00:48:29,974 --> 00:49:01,627
where he he claims that he didn't realize at first that he was kind of retailing this story. He said, I realized that I I... I realized that the plot line was similar, all oh, I began coming up with the idea of me the out in the brush and brass. I suddenly realized that I was duplicating a plot line I had used years ago, the the and mystery of the swamp. This that gave me pause for a while, But I realized that only the plot was similar all other elements were breaking new route. Besides the fit were more believable,

423
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:08,604
and interesting than the diesel. So so I went ahead with the story and let the guides fall they might

424
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:36,352
and I mean, in a way that's right because the measles were so out there. But I I don't think that he's entirely right there because I think he he ended up following this story be maybe a little bit too closely, and it just... It doesn't fit. Yeah. But there's also in in the next frame, Scrooge says that's the ticket. Tell them I'll be easy on the rent, and I'll let them have one whole lake fish on out of the thousand lakes that he has bought. And and then if you say, they'll love you uncle groups.

425
00:49:37,088 --> 00:49:50,810
Right. It's it's it's very sarcastic from the nephews, but I feel like they could be protesting a little bit harder. I feel like they're very passive throughout this whole story. Because Scrooge is really this, like, smog cloud of impending doom.

426
00:49:51,961 --> 00:49:53,938
I mean. He he is absolutely

427
00:49:54,515 --> 00:50:04,205
going to destroy the Kiwi guys way of life. Yeah. And and so we get this neat moment here where we cut to the Kiwi guys and we see what they're up to, and they are

428
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:06,197
celebrating that they have routed

429
00:50:06,654 --> 00:50:18,947
the pale docs as they as they call them. So these characters are definitely coded as white men, right? Despite being docks. The these are... We know that they are white people. And they are literally white.

430
00:50:19,247 --> 00:50:19,327
Yes.

431
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:25,427
I I really like their cute. We we kiwi we guys with our... With our arrows

432
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,160
still the thunder

433
00:50:27,498 --> 00:50:28,596
in its boo.

434
00:50:29,772 --> 00:50:34,357
No idea what Google is supposed to be, but I love it. So

435
00:50:34,857 --> 00:50:49,723
So they they... That the the chief cha them not to celebrate too early because the dots may come back to and uncheck the kiwi guys. Gosh, I love their dialogue And the Ducktales approach them to the sound of distant

436
00:50:50,036 --> 00:50:55,244
Tom Toms. Again, it's all very indian ish later that that evening.

437
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:05,003
And we see a moment where they porta. This is that's definitely a a word that I learned from these Comments. They ported their canoe over from one, lake, to another.

438
00:51:05,935 --> 00:51:07,929
To kind of enact their plan.

439
00:51:08,368 --> 00:51:10,064
And they see them chanting

440
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:13,653
what their plan is. But would anyone like to

441
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,221
can ham up there

442
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,219
they're yeah their monologue.

443
00:51:18,598 --> 00:51:25,427
I'm on it. We must trick the pale deck warriors, we must bring them to our council. There to test their good intentions

444
00:51:25,847 --> 00:51:27,407
and to ask what they are planning,

445
00:51:27,927 --> 00:51:29,707
Al that was great, Ryan. Wonderful.

446
00:51:30,047 --> 00:51:37,142
Thank you. I I hope by the way that now that I really highlighted this for modern listeners that you go back and try and, like,

447
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:48,873
maybe even read it aloud. It's it's kind of fun. It's neat to know that there is, like, a very specific rhythm that is supposed to have. Oh... It is interesting that they view the the Ducktales as warriors.

448
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:56,037
U. Like they had one weapon which is gone now, and it's just like an old man, a middle aged man, and some children.

449
00:51:57,257 --> 00:52:07,123
And that's the that's the army that's come to page, you know. Yeah. Right. Right. The the kiwi guys are giving the docs a lot of credit throughout this story. It's kind of that like

450
00:52:07,676 --> 00:52:12,971
it's that little trope about. Can they prove their worth and then we'll allow them to

451
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:16,387
to be in their kind of superior position.

452
00:52:17,161 --> 00:52:22,342
And we get... We get a an awkward scalp reference to... Again, it's all Indian,

453
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:23,342
Donald

454
00:52:23,776 --> 00:52:27,069
sneaks up and says are your scalp on tight

455
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:29,402
another of those very winds moments.

456
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,357
And and day,

457
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:54,681
the kiwi guys reveal what the big, like, deed that the have to do. Sue, do you wanna do you wanna tell us about the the a d that they have to do. Oh, they've got a... They've got a fish for the king sturgeon, which is they're like... He's there... He's their big bad in the lake. And so that's... It if the docs can can catch this fish, this giant King sturgeon, then then that proves that they're were. Right.

458
00:52:55,536 --> 00:52:56,036
Exactly.

459
00:52:56,774 --> 00:53:03,841
And then we get the little sequence the awkward sequence where they they g onto to the little scout that has

460
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:10,184
wise gone to look for the dots suspecting them speaking about, But but not wisely

461
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:27,170
chose unlikely not to bring a companion along with him. Well, I I sure love his thought balloon as he... I mean, it's it's very like, it's it's very common condescending because he uses the word the pronoun and me instead of eye. But

462
00:53:27,586 --> 00:53:41,143
sue, would you... Would you like take a crack at reading his internal thoughts as he says me here not by. Me you're not but whispering pine trees. Hear the lapping of the waters. Here the cricket making squeaky and the woo hoo of the outlet.

463
00:53:42,714 --> 00:53:43,214
So

464
00:53:43,926 --> 00:53:47,263
they're extremely poetic. They're very dim.

465
00:53:47,881 --> 00:53:55,823
And everything they do and say is very cute even when they're being threatening It's all super kinda condescending. But it... To me, it sure is

466
00:53:56,161 --> 00:54:00,723
it's very entertaining. Also, I I feel like a lot of I mean, you know,

467
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:16,940
what am I... What am I trying to think of? Like, if if you look at, like, any kind of physical conflict like this, for... That's aimed at this age group, Like, you know, how how does Ga mail talk maybe with the Sm or or whoever the care Barks fight?

468
00:54:18,075 --> 00:54:18,973
You know what I mean?

469
00:54:19,749 --> 00:54:21,166
It's always going to be

470
00:54:21,822 --> 00:54:25,526
kind of cute. Because you don't want to give little tiny kids nightmares.

471
00:54:26,661 --> 00:54:28,675
Right. Right. He was know this.

472
00:54:29,292 --> 00:54:45,543
Exactly. He he was writing this under sort of the Disney code. Western Publishing, you know, had very stringent guidelines about what you could do. So this is a way of making it interesting. And and so, you know, the next sequence months deals with the the capture and the aftermath of the capture.

473
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:52,102
This is this is pretty neat. They they get back to their sea plain and they find that it's been sunk.

474
00:54:53,475 --> 00:55:00,062
I really like that panel. It shows all this wildlife life kind of squat on the half some c plain.

475
00:55:00,402 --> 00:55:06,182
And and they're very... That now they're very distraught because as Donald says those little Tom

476
00:55:07,817 --> 00:55:11,557
oh geez. We'll we'll be here in a few minutes like buzzing hornets.

477
00:55:11,897 --> 00:55:14,137
That's a completely original slur as far as I know.

478
00:55:14,857 --> 00:55:21,972
Yeah. I know. It's it's definitely a slur, but we can we can say it doesn't have a long legacy.

479
00:55:23,765 --> 00:55:33,010
I I mean, it's it's a it's a it is not a nice thing to say. Right? This is just how that gets catherine throughout. And again, we I think it's interesting

480
00:55:33,348 --> 00:55:40,753
the... Like, again, this is this is whole. I'm like, where are they going with this plan? They're gonna get on their sea plain. Where are they taking this guy

481
00:55:41,146 --> 00:55:41,646
I.

482
00:55:42,263 --> 00:55:44,439
This doesn't seem like they're plan at all.

483
00:55:44,857 --> 00:55:48,470
Right. Right. This is like this is, like taking poc

484
00:55:48,927 --> 00:55:59,582
fax to to England, I guess. To like. But what they're gonna do, show him the great smokes stacks of duck to try to, like, turn him around. I I know. It's it's a little.

485
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:02,416
We won't do this to your land.

486
00:56:03,314 --> 00:56:07,221
Right. So so they basically have to flee on cattle.

487
00:56:07,638 --> 00:56:16,917
And we get this this this sequence is both very neat, but it's also very, like, trophy. Right? We we see the that the little kiwi got

488
00:56:17,732 --> 00:56:26,232
talking to the animals as he passes them. I really like the little conversation with the fish using little like bubble,

489
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:34,080
little conversation with the the little baby wildcat cats. I just like how

490
00:56:35,178 --> 00:56:35,932
they're like

491
00:56:36,511 --> 00:56:41,726
dismiss of him like, oh, look at him pretending to talk to the. The little the little war makes

492
00:56:42,305 --> 00:56:45,003
believe he's talking to animals. He's sure a hard.

493
00:56:45,517 --> 00:56:51,037
And I just love. I just love that, like, they're completely just dismissive and then that's actually what was happening.

494
00:56:51,637 --> 00:56:51,917
Right.

495
00:56:52,651 --> 00:56:59,562
Right. And it's weird for the the the Nephews to be dismissive that way because they're usually, like, more open minded than that.

496
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:04,831
But the little... The little kiwi we got that convince is a wildcat cat to

497
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:08,147
free him and then take his place as they're porting

498
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:10,482
the canoe between lakes.

499
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:17,362
And and then we get this neat little sequence where the wildcat cat attacks them causing them to

500
00:57:18,276 --> 00:57:21,013
go overboard and syncing their canoe,

501
00:57:21,432 --> 00:57:24,848
which has them really Inducks pickle because they hear

502
00:57:25,202 --> 00:57:26,722
we got a pretty unfortunate, like,

503
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:32,462
of, I think, the sound of war whoop as as Donald has just

504
00:57:33,536 --> 00:57:38,032
Again, coined another slur, the little... Oh there was Al nephews a little war.

505
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:47,375
What is the what is the voice scouts to analog the voice belong to? Which. Yeah. When when I was... When I was a with chuck, I actually got the canoe merit badge,

506
00:57:48,214 --> 00:58:02,972
and you you can't make a canoe do that. It doesn't... It doesn't sink like that like the titanic. If you can fill it entirely with water so that that is just like a a bathtub of water to the top. And it will just hover a couple feet below the water.

507
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:09,032
So the water level in the will match the water level outside the ka canoe, but it'll still be there. You can actually keep pedal it.

508
00:58:09,806 --> 00:58:15,240
If you're strong enough, it takes a lot of work because now you're pedal your own weight and then five hundred pounds of water.

509
00:58:16,398 --> 00:58:21,517
But you can do. That's a great fact. That's why that's why why I've got guests on. That's awesome.

510
00:58:22,195 --> 00:58:25,817
I guess, I guess we need to presume that the the wildcat cat

511
00:58:26,317 --> 00:58:26,817
maybe

512
00:58:27,196 --> 00:58:30,857
tore it up to this clause or that Barks just didn't know.

513
00:58:32,036 --> 00:58:38,479
Actually, actually kinda... He does have some quote somewhere I read where he... He was never a boy scout,

514
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:45,350
but that he was very... Like, he had admired them and then, you know, the wood shots were kinda way of regretting that you didn't get to be one.

515
00:58:46,505 --> 00:58:56,506
So this this is another of those echoes from mystery of the swamp where the dots are gonna hide and some tall reads and they're gonna use them to conceal themselves,

516
00:58:57,281 --> 00:58:59,734
breathe through the the, like, weeds

517
00:59:00,445 --> 00:59:05,014
It's neat. It's it's a fun little little thing that is ultimately gonna be

518
00:59:05,551 --> 00:59:06,051
unsuccessful.

519
00:59:07,401 --> 00:59:54,382
And and I feel like they should know that it's gonna be unsuccessful. Soon what you want... This is the part. This is the part where I'm like, this whole scene from the reads to the flying out of the water when the fish is, like, poke him in the box. I feel like this is what slowed down the pacing. Because we don't get anything new here. Like we already know they can talk to the animals. You're in a lake with fish. Like you already saw him talking to the fish. It should not be a surprise that you are not going to be able to hide here. And it kind of... It kind of just goes. And and I feel like it's a really long build up for the for the gag when they get helped in the bus. That was very funny. But I feel like I feel like you could have done with like one or two panels to set that up. Instead they've got, like, a page and a half here. And I think that's what slowed down the pacing for me. I was like, there's nothing

520
00:59:54,722 --> 01:00:02,462
new here. This is just a very long build up to the visual gag. Sure. Yeah. I think that's reasonable. It it is... It could have been largely

521
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,952
taken out. I mean, it's it's a fun little bit. We see these ga.

522
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:21,072
I think their guard. They're actually wetting They're like noses on some underwater rocks to, like, quote sharpen them. But you're right. It's it's a weird plot hole because the Ducktales literally see them. Talking to fish.

523
01:00:21,449 --> 01:00:38,025
So it feels like that's the moment to be like, okay. The jig is up, we we need to come clean to, like, maybe buy some honeywell goodwill but, you know, it's a poke in the butt gag, and it is comic for kids. So Yeah. No. I enjoyed the poke in the buck. Don't get me wrong. I'm saying the build was too long. Right.

524
01:00:38,784 --> 01:00:47,452
Right. And the docs definitely do have it coming. I will say. Oh, for sure. Oh, boy. I I like I can't read every little bit of the Kiwi guys

525
01:00:48,112 --> 01:01:00,958
dialogue, but I sure do like the... This one where where the chief says me have heard from Ga Pipe fish heard from Needle knows, the Pic rail. Wait, they say, and soon the pale ups will jump

526
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:04,483
will jump three high from the Ducktales.

527
01:01:05,179 --> 01:01:07,513
And and sure enough they do

528
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:09,786
and and they have a

529
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:13,757
confrontation here. And and basically the point of the

530
01:01:14,097 --> 01:01:18,037
confrontation, Well what do you think Ryan? What's the whole point of this confrontation?

531
01:01:19,151 --> 01:01:23,167
Basically, they're arguing about ownership because the the chief is saying,

532
01:01:23,786 --> 01:01:32,006
you know, we've caught them. We're gonna bring them to our counsel and ask them why they're probably through our waters. Scrooge says your water's your sq on my land and the chief is saying

533
01:01:32,424 --> 01:01:37,980
by what token can be approved that you own these lakes and forests Scrooge screws has this paper from San the Real estate, ma'am.

534
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:42,264
Yeah. I can take you to his office. It was sidewalk sandy estate.

535
01:01:42,856 --> 01:01:47,392
That that is a wonderful panel. Right? Because Scrooge has this, like, triumph

536
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:50,508
look on his face as though he has made,

537
01:01:50,927 --> 01:02:16,292
you know, check made. I I can tell you and and the Nephew is like, in in the back looks very s in because he knows that it's in in the face. He kinda knows the deal. Right? And and they're surrounded biology these peaceful with one creatures because we've got this noble connected to the land trope going on here. But he knows what a ridiculous thing it is to tell these native Americans about land ownership

538
01:02:16,629 --> 01:02:22,257
according to a piece of. Yeah. Let me explain to you what the county recorder is. You see there's the

539
01:02:24,517 --> 01:02:27,897
Right. And there's even that there's even... I noticed in this panel, there's

540
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,189
kiwi got that has Al like a chip

541
01:02:31,567 --> 01:02:34,224
just sitting on it on his head as part of the council.

542
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:49,617
Right. One go the proceedings. I didn't catch that on the first read. Right. And and you could be kind and read it as oh, the Pb guys are just so connected to nature they commune with the for us or you could be like, oh, the Pb guys might as well be animals of the forest.

543
01:02:50,276 --> 01:02:53,374
Either way, it's it's definitely trophy and in,

544
01:02:54,032 --> 01:02:56,664
but it but it's it's an it's a very cool scene

545
01:02:57,042 --> 01:02:57,441
admittedly.

546
01:02:59,078 --> 01:03:02,052
And and Scrooge, you know, he really is below.

547
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:10,042
He's saying I intense to save this land and myself from being sm by factories and so forth.

548
01:03:10,499 --> 01:03:15,084
I love his little connecting look. On the next page. Where it kinda puts his hands

549
01:03:15,423 --> 01:03:17,561
together, and he has this kind dreamy

550
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:18,400
hu

551
01:03:19,018 --> 01:03:21,412
look on his faith on his face.

552
01:03:22,112 --> 01:03:22,612
And

553
01:03:23,472 --> 01:03:37,067
the Nephews are all smiling at all the animals around and chi him, but that very in a very subdued way. Because it's the kiwi guys that have to counter him. And and a couple of the regular kiwi guys, they they speak simultaneous

554
01:03:37,781 --> 01:03:39,837
saying that their words are slim,

555
01:03:40,933 --> 01:03:47,394
and they they resolve that the duct need to prove their worth by having their greatest warrior

556
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:49,948
attach the great king

557
01:03:50,366 --> 01:03:51,665
sturgeon And

558
01:03:52,123 --> 01:03:55,631
and that... That's gonna take us to the sturgeon

559
01:03:56,248 --> 01:03:56,748
sequence.

560
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:00,796
So what do you what did you guys think about this version sequence ones?

561
01:04:02,407 --> 01:04:04,505
I like... I like how one of the f nephews

562
01:04:04,923 --> 01:04:09,338
is saying that the sturgeon is the the villain of the the pc because. So and I'm like

563
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:11,391
Nice try hon.

564
01:04:13,048 --> 01:04:16,104
Right. Maybe yesterday. He was... He was there.

565
01:04:17,617 --> 01:04:36,549
I I really like the sequence. It... Maybe it drags on a little bit. But I don't know. It it plays out pretty cool. It plays out in a pretty neat manner. We've got Donald kind of sitting around moaning because, of course, he's got kinda have. He's not the old man. He's not a he's not a literal child. So he's kinda capture the

566
01:04:37,525 --> 01:04:38,663
the king surgeon

567
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:44,898
and and we see this nice little bit of for shadowing Ryan Tell us about the fore foreshadowing about the search sturgeon

568
01:04:45,274 --> 01:04:45,633
size.

569
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:47,089
Well, they...

570
01:04:47,465 --> 01:04:56,897
The tribe sends some couple canoe out to lower the kiwi got into the Cove, and then we just get a tail that kind of crosses through the the middle of the the canoe.

571
01:04:57,789 --> 01:05:04,109
And and there is a painting, a famous painting called Mo dip by Rockwell

572
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:04,946
kent

573
01:05:05,283 --> 01:05:09,437
that this, like, panel is supposed to be echoing.

574
01:05:09,857 --> 01:05:15,330
Right. Now. It's pretty cool. Here. I'll I'll show it to you guys. Really quickly. Maybe be tech

575
01:05:16,469 --> 01:05:16,969
kent.

576
01:05:17,388 --> 01:05:24,373
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I thought that was... That was a neat little illusion that I would never have known about if I didn't, like actively

577
01:05:25,468 --> 01:05:26,624
research this story.

578
01:05:27,102 --> 01:05:28,001
Alright. So

579
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:31,487
very reluctant and donald gets pushed out to do this.

580
01:05:32,221 --> 01:05:38,234
And he's gonna use a pumpkin as bait because of the size of that king surgeon

581
01:05:38,653 --> 01:05:44,392
and he's gonna try to do this from sure with a grapple hook that they conveniently have and

582
01:05:44,849 --> 01:05:46,026
it's also worth noting

583
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:49,089
Scrooge just still kind of in Al play mode.

584
01:05:49,687 --> 01:05:52,980
As soon as the canoe are destroyed, Scrooge tells donald,

585
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:55,312
go land that oversized min.

586
01:05:56,447 --> 01:05:57,287
Yeah. Exactly.

587
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,287
This is not a big deal. Just go catch the little fish.

588
01:06:01,767 --> 01:06:01,847
Right.

589
01:06:02,727 --> 01:06:14,207
Right. And I And this sturgeon is like enormous. Have you guys ever seen a sturgeon in real life? No. No. They're terrifying on fishing trip ones, I saw one like surface

590
01:06:14,905 --> 01:06:23,892
right next to where I was I was very unsuccessfully fishing. And I just blocked that. It must have been five or six feet. And it looked pre.

591
01:06:24,512 --> 01:06:44,772
And and you know what, if you think about the Ducktales scale, the very biggest of surgeons, that this is only a little bit of an exaggeration kind a. Because they don't get this big in general, but they they can get pretty darn big. And this is a really neat fight... It's visually, I think, pretty exciting for a comment book. I we can't really do a justice

592
01:06:45,352 --> 01:06:52,907
in the comment books, So I'm not really gonna try to. But you know, donald braces himself against the tree and it gets ripped out

593
01:06:53,807 --> 01:07:09,947
and and the surgeon is pulling him around as he's as he's clinging to the tree, even jumping through the tree stock, like the tree trunk like a stock of Al. And and the whole time, this is Sc is not showing a ton of concern.

594
01:07:10,347 --> 01:07:20,730
Is he? You guys wanna tell me about what Scrooge is up to? He's finding he's finding Rare earth minerals roles. He's got some lithium and some making it up and some...

595
01:07:21,546 --> 01:07:29,245
What I don't don't remember what he calls them all, but Huey, it like Donald Donald is, like screaming for his life and screws is just, like in the sand

596
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:38,792
trying trying to exploit the land some more Yeah. It's not it's not a very... It doesn't paint a very good picture of screws here.

597
01:07:39,872 --> 01:07:40,652
Boy rare

598
01:07:41,152 --> 01:07:41,972
are pretty

599
01:07:42,606 --> 01:07:48,978
hot commodity these days. Right? Like the these are these are in the news quite a bit. These are gonna be

600
01:07:49,531 --> 01:07:52,939
a lot of our future words are gonna be fought over rare Earth minerals

601
01:07:53,754 --> 01:08:02,252
and they make up c accept some pretty funny names as you say there's a couple of real ones in there, and then he's just kind of... This this apparently is incredibly

602
01:08:02,671 --> 01:08:15,606
rich land and we've got this funny gag here where this very much Scrooge his character. He is so good at identifying this stuff that he's able to, like, pile it around, like a a little kid playing with play,

603
01:08:15,943 --> 01:08:16,443
maybe.

604
01:08:16,819 --> 01:08:22,780
And and the Nephews user panicking is Donald is swimming for his life, and they they yell at him

605
01:08:23,292 --> 01:08:31,442
and he's just... He's... He might as well be trans by these minerals. And so it is up to the junior shocks.

606
01:08:31,935 --> 01:08:33,392
To save them. And

607
01:08:33,808 --> 01:08:37,176
junior would check Bailey, do you want to tell us about

608
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:38,827
about how they do it?

609
01:08:39,721 --> 01:08:40,821
So they

610
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,916
decide they they should be able to do something with all those repair earth.

611
01:08:44,796 --> 01:08:47,392
So they check their manual on on rare earth.

612
01:08:49,365 --> 01:08:49,865
And

613
01:08:50,524 --> 01:08:53,381
so they look for recipes under magic of...

614
01:08:53,881 --> 01:08:56,818
That that's a weird little moment. Right? It's very scientific

615
01:08:57,572 --> 01:09:16,469
I I noticed that the word balloon is a little bit bigger. I wonder if Barks was like maybe he just... He didn't get around to imagine it might have even been It might have been a placeholder holder word or something that he never kinda got around. We never fixed... That makes a lot more sense than... Yeah. Look under your man. Right. He's like okay.

616
01:09:17,388 --> 01:09:22,582
Some something something would check magic. I'll think of something and And there private here.

617
01:09:24,433 --> 01:09:27,104
Right. Right. Circuit trying here. Yeah.

618
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:28,939
So Tell us what they end up with.

619
01:09:29,697 --> 01:09:32,368
So they they make the most powerful pill ever rolled.

620
01:09:33,022 --> 01:09:36,198
Oxide of str bo. Do guys know what referencing

621
01:09:36,657 --> 01:09:37,336
Str bo?

622
01:09:37,975 --> 01:09:39,714
Str bo is he from Ben,

623
01:09:40,387 --> 01:09:43,688
Yeah. In in in Disney's version of Pin,

624
01:09:44,787 --> 01:09:48,008
it's not in the original Italian one, but they name him strong.

625
01:09:48,523 --> 01:10:02,104
Which is also like a meat and cheese filled, Italian American pastry. Those are the only two things that I knew it from. And Again, res researching. I I learned that there is a pretty famous Italian volcano that is named str.

626
01:10:02,562 --> 01:10:07,545
So Oh, wow. That makes sense. Yeah. And then we continue. Then they

627
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:08,701
throw it into

628
01:10:09,477 --> 01:10:13,605
the fish open mouth as it's about to swallow donald. It is already swallowed

629
01:10:14,036 --> 01:10:22,351
the tree that Donald used as Al. And the Donald was surfing for a while out in the... Out in the lake. And now Donald, it's Donald final moments.

630
01:10:23,342 --> 01:10:26,494
And he's getting swallowed and the fish sw them both together. Right.

631
01:10:27,292 --> 01:10:29,468
Yeah. He even says as he

632
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:42,750
as he Barks into the into the fish mouth. I'm bush to move over, Jonah. Here I come Yeah. I I really like this. It's very car ish right? The the giant monster

633
01:10:43,129 --> 01:10:45,227
forwarded by eating a a spicy,

634
01:10:46,005 --> 01:10:46,505
but

635
01:10:46,884 --> 01:10:55,535
but that is funny. It worked for me. I love... I love seeing that they sturgeon and out of water. That's interesting to note that they didn't kill it. We see a little

636
01:10:56,112 --> 01:10:57,250
sn z's

637
01:10:57,923 --> 01:11:00,103
above the fish as donald in.

638
01:11:01,202 --> 01:11:03,182
Another and another little moment

639
01:11:03,883 --> 01:11:06,863
sue Scrooge can't help, but exploits

640
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:08,037
but think

641
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:09,677
taste oil.

642
01:11:10,337 --> 01:11:11,357
Twice as a pint.

643
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:37,842
Right. And the kiwi guys are loading. They're celebrating the duct for having a van pushed the surgeon and. I guess he won't last very long out of the water like that, a sleep or not. Does it have disease in in the version of the story that you guys reading? Okay. Yeah. No. I'm trying can't through to see to see... Like, I I just assumed they were gonna eat him, but But no. We don't get any... Never appears again. He never appears again. No. Yeah.

644
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:40,862
That's it for the great king's surgeon and

645
01:11:41,337 --> 01:11:43,593
probably been alive for a couple of centuries.

646
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:49,259
Alright. And and so now we've got our last big sequence of the story.

647
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:51,031
And another

648
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:51,950
very

649
01:11:52,609 --> 01:11:53,109
indian

650
01:11:53,487 --> 01:11:56,304
moment as the kiwi guys prepare

651
01:11:56,683 --> 01:12:02,211
to Gonna say this with a big sigh. They they get ready to smoke them Indian style.

652
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:04,807
Right? They're they're using that Indian pigeon.

653
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:20,215
So that this is like, this is one of the things that all white people knew about Inducks and in this sierra is that they're... They always smoked piece five some And native Americans did use piece pipes, but it varied by culture varied by tribe.

654
01:12:20,952 --> 01:12:26,414
This is naturally gonna be very Ducktales. But... But it was done in great ceremony, and

655
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:34,246
I I have no doubt that there's a lot of elements of this that he gets wrong here, but I'm not in the no enough.

656
01:12:34,865 --> 01:12:41,518
So so yeah, they're gonna have a piece type ceremony as the kiwi guys sit down to listen to quotes

657
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:43,848
there... His

658
01:12:44,264 --> 01:12:50,677
Scrooge many plans and wishes, and they will listen to his big ambition And

659
01:12:51,057 --> 01:13:04,912
is one of you wanna tell me what Scrooge hopes are is very contradictory for hopes here. He says my hopes are to keep these Legs clean an air pure on the forest screen, which, you know, it's a little hard to swallow.

660
01:13:05,449 --> 01:13:11,985
I won't add factories or sm at least I think I can keep myself from doing that at for a while, I hope.

661
01:13:12,442 --> 01:13:32,688
So so every bit of signaling here, you guys is is that Scrooge is not gonna be able to... I mean, he is outright telling us. See he might as well be, like, elbow the reader. Like I'm Scrooge Mick dot. I'm I'm definitely going to exploit this land. And so... And so I think what the kiwi guys have done here is justified

662
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:38,032
because the the other thing that's hard swallow is is the peace pipe. Right?

663
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:44,014
He immediately choke because because one of the kiwi guys has poisoned him.

664
01:13:45,226 --> 01:13:54,839
Uncle Scrooge kind of plop over looking very sick and the dumps say that they needed to rush him to the nearest doctor. And,

665
01:13:55,614 --> 01:14:09,640
Ryan, do you wanna... Do you wanna tell about the the chief Huey, guys moment of confusion there? He didn't think that pale Inducks uncle visa week fit pipes smoke ruin him, and the other guy says, min now me sprinkle tobacco hinge of oxide of str bo,

666
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,810
Me points at the little the little pile that

667
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:21,931
that the boys made from all the rare elements. Right. And and he breaks the fourth wall a little bit. He wink clearly at the reader. I think that that

668
01:14:22,269 --> 01:14:26,719
little kiwi guy is coded as being a which doctor. Right? Because he's got little

669
01:14:27,072 --> 01:14:27,572
Yeah.

670
01:14:28,393 --> 01:14:37,448
Or I guess his code is being a medicine, man. But but to me, that's kind of almost which doctor coding. So again, It's it's very Indian ish.

671
01:14:38,168 --> 01:14:41,468
And then our our very final little cap sequence.

672
01:14:41,968 --> 01:14:48,923
I guess this is a little bit of abrupt. Right? In in the mystery of the swamp, the denise get rid of

673
01:14:49,263 --> 01:14:51,323
donald than the boys by giving them

674
01:14:51,718 --> 01:14:55,266
some food that's been spiked with what they call for jet juice.

675
01:14:56,222 --> 01:14:58,176
Gives the docs completing amnesia.

676
01:14:58,575 --> 01:15:03,263
And and in a way, screws just chooses here to forget about it.

677
01:15:04,143 --> 01:15:16,931
Soon you wanna tell us about him him waking up days later? Yeah. He he wakes up and his what's that wonderful smell and he sticks his nose out into the smog and just like, breathe it in and says this is like honey

678
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:18,743
compared to the that pipe

679
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:43,447
you know, and like, well what about the land? Like, what are you gonna do with it? And you he's decided he doesn't want it anymore if it means he has to smoke those piece pipes. With the Indian. So you'll just give it back to the land back to them. Right. So he's basically renown his claim. He might as well be forgetting the Pb guys and that gets to live in peace. With... I guess no king surgeon around to

680
01:15:43,784 --> 01:15:46,575
them. So that that's it. That's land of the Pin

681
01:15:47,134 --> 01:15:47,333
You guys.

682
01:15:48,147 --> 01:15:51,463
What are your thoughts about this story overall? Ryan?

683
01:15:52,942 --> 01:15:55,799
Like sue, I was also bracing myself or something

684
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:58,090
much more offensive.

685
01:15:59,186 --> 01:15:59,686
And

686
01:16:00,343 --> 01:16:09,408
I thought, you know, the environmental message was pretty good. Like, it was It was nice that the guy who wanted to exploit the land for its resources was not the hero of the story.

687
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:10,208
And

688
01:16:10,628 --> 01:16:17,451
and that the people who lived there got to keep living there and and, you know, keep their way of life. And I thought the highlight was probably

689
01:16:17,908 --> 01:16:25,368
donald versus the fish. I thought that was kind of an epic action set piece that would be cool to see Al animation or something.

690
01:16:25,908 --> 01:16:27,028
Yeah. Yeah. I agree.

691
01:16:27,988 --> 01:16:32,383
Yeah. Well said, I think that it it is a surprisingly

692
01:16:32,763 --> 01:16:33,263
progressive

693
01:16:33,643 --> 01:16:35,943
message, at least from Al ecological

694
01:16:36,403 --> 01:16:57,213
standpoint for nineteen fifty seven from someone who is clearly an ardent capitalist like Carl Barks having having created the character of Uncle Group. He he definitely contains multi. Right? Because he is a big proponent of capitalism apart from, like, inventing Scrooge mick doc a lot of his correspondence does, like, make that explicit.

695
01:16:57,906 --> 01:17:04,987
But but he's also very, very ecological minded. What about used to? What did you think of this? I think I think the...

696
01:17:05,683 --> 01:17:08,750
Maybe maybe Barks six flooring that

697
01:17:09,525 --> 01:17:14,290
that kind of push and pull between the exploit capitalism and the

698
01:17:14,906 --> 01:17:15,406
ecological

699
01:17:15,957 --> 01:17:23,682
you know, the the clear benefits you get from preserving the land and having to breathe and stuff. I think there was a really interesting probably

700
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:45,740
exploration for him because he he goes back and forth and back and forth on it. And and Scrooge never learns anything. He never learned the lesson. He's still like he he just... He just got poisoned and went home. You know what I mean? Like, I feel like that might have been Barks kind of like giving up on a on a way to reconcile those two things. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

701
01:17:46,260 --> 01:18:11,934
No. I I I don't think you should second guess yourself. There. I think that's a really... Like Scrooge is he's he's old and and he... We we see that he's not gonna change his ways. Right? We can tell from all that rare not side of sp william and and every other panel being him taken only by the resources. So, like, it's true. I think Scrooge is, like, too long gone in this story. He's he's pretty much corrupted

702
01:18:12,273 --> 01:18:22,727
as far as this goes, and it's really up to the P guys to to take their own agents see I I like it a lot. I think it's... I... This story doesn't hold up in a lot of ways, obviously.

703
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:27,808
But but it's it's not means spirited about it. Right? It's more of a time capsule

704
01:18:28,308 --> 01:18:29,489
and anything else.

705
01:18:30,588 --> 01:18:33,208
It is... It isn't it is a really

706
01:18:33,588 --> 01:18:34,088
neat

707
01:18:34,468 --> 01:18:36,883
exploration as you say sue of these this like,

708
01:18:37,681 --> 01:18:40,137
pushing and paul this, like, capitalism

709
01:18:40,635 --> 01:19:02,114
versus land preservation And and he's just written too much Scrooge mick dot. To really come down on the side of ecology, even if we are meant to, like, relate to the Huey, guys behind them very noble. They they just have to do it over here. At the end of the story, we... We're going back to dump. Right? We're buying our comment books.

710
01:19:03,086 --> 01:19:07,537
We're enjoying the fruits of those rare earth minerals throughout the rest of the fifties

711
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:08,854
and the sixties,

712
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:12,919
and and that's there's just nothing to be done for it.

713
01:19:14,036 --> 01:19:21,615
So, like, the story has its problems, but this this is well, like, this is very well regarded by Barks stands. This is certainly

714
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:28,282
among the more famous stories. And and I think there's too much great about it to kind of discount So

715
01:19:28,739 --> 01:19:36,074
we we've talked kind of extensively about, you know, what what is dated and archaic about it. It generally does not hold up very well.

716
01:19:37,524 --> 01:19:44,460
This is not something where he did one of... I'm not aware of him doing any of his famous oil paintings or lift the grass for this one.

717
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:56,635
I think they're put in some cool. Subject matters from this, like the the sturgeon fight, you know, is was pretty neat. And again, you know, this this would been too problematic to adapt think into a duck

718
01:19:57,412 --> 01:19:59,070
story It definitely

719
01:19:59,807 --> 01:20:04,771
has... The the kiwi guys have been used again by other creators, you know,

720
01:20:05,648 --> 01:20:15,654
Almost never did sequel to his stories even if he did, like, kind of revisit them. So Don Rosa did a direct sequel to this one called war of the When

721
01:20:16,152 --> 01:20:17,729
are more of the win to go

722
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:22,933
where Scrooge ends up saving the Huey, guys. From

723
01:20:23,432 --> 01:20:24,811
a much more villainous

724
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:27,488
developer in that one. Mh

725
01:20:27,827 --> 01:20:32,697
I haven't read that one in a good decade. I'm looking forward to revisiting it in my

726
01:20:34,195 --> 01:20:35,973
upcoming don rosa focused

727
01:20:36,592 --> 01:20:45,888
podcast, but that'll be quite some time from now Can I tell you guys that I spinning off to Rosa remarks in a couple of months? No. That's a huge reveal.

728
01:20:46,346 --> 01:20:54,079
Yes. Yes. It's It is a pretty big deal. I'm gonna start doing these bim monthly. Doing these by monthly and doing rosa or Barks.

729
01:20:55,052 --> 01:20:57,963
Bim as well. So, yeah, they they did word of the.

730
01:20:58,761 --> 01:21:04,365
There was another duct creator that did kind of a weird pre story that has the Pb guys

731
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:08,698
and a character from a Golden Helmet from hundreds of years

732
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:13,178
before. Alright. And then if we check on the community,

733
01:21:13,493 --> 01:21:22,019
and how they feel about it on Inducks, the site that fans used to find out information about and and vote on the stories

734
01:21:22,398 --> 01:21:37,526
This one does very well. It's clearly very well regarded by the community. It gets a seven point nine out of ten, which is good for rank fifty seven out of all forty two thousand some Disney comic stories. So definitely well regard. Let's see.

735
01:21:37,965 --> 01:21:48,429
Before we wrap things up. Do you guys have any final thoughts or are there any, like, panels that you really that really stood out to you that you'd like to highlight as one of your favorites?

736
01:21:49,202 --> 01:21:55,530
I was gonna point out. I like the one where the the tree that Mcdonald's has wrapped his cord around

737
01:21:55,908 --> 01:21:57,845
finally rips out of the little

738
01:21:58,398 --> 01:22:02,095
that he's on, and and he just... Is in the air mid air

739
01:22:03,193 --> 01:22:16,695
getting pulled out into the lake by the by the fish. It's a good action shot. He's kind of standing on the tree and and bracing against it with the rope. It's... He looks like an action hero. Yeah. No. I I I like this one too. I think all the physical

740
01:22:17,368 --> 01:22:27,760
I think that it holds up really well. I really also like the shot of the pumpkin on the Grappling hook. That's just sailing through the air as is his bait... This fish that's so big. He's bay.

741
01:22:28,837 --> 01:22:29,337
Pumpkin.

742
01:22:29,754 --> 01:22:29,834
Yeah.

743
01:22:30,631 --> 01:22:33,005
You guys highlighted some panels from the

744
01:22:33,382 --> 01:22:52,747
the surge and fight and and it is as you mentioned ryan. It's a great action piece. It's very well, John. It's very strong. I like the one where the surgeon is crunching the tree. He looks terrifying that. And then there's a lot of great panels here. There's some obvious ones like the big splash panel, the pb guys fleeing.

745
01:22:53,246 --> 01:22:59,039
The the one of the, like Airs moves, the false moose is is very ominous and terrifying.

746
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:03,980
But like every little side of Scrooge kind of catching

747
01:23:04,436 --> 01:23:13,524
himself, right, as he realizes that he's back to... He's he's back on his he's back on his stuff. He he can't help himself. And he he guilt

748
01:23:13,981 --> 01:23:23,108
realizing that is great. I think this one has an unusual number. Of really great panels and it's got a lot of strong art. So so you guys...

749
01:23:23,485 --> 01:23:27,869
This was a really cool story to talk about. Again, it's very deep.

750
01:23:28,289 --> 01:23:30,968
There's a lot of layers to it for a kid's comic, I think.

751
01:23:31,928 --> 01:23:36,963
And I appreciate it. It's also one that, you know, really needs a little bit of processing.

752
01:23:37,538 --> 01:23:45,705
Thank you so much for joining me to process this one. As always listeners can reach out share comments and

753
01:23:46,122 --> 01:23:53,717
follow along, you know, I've got some fun blog type thoughts about these stories that I post on Facebook and some on

754
01:23:54,275 --> 01:24:23,823
Instagram, we're Al Barks remarks on the socials and join us again next week as we cover a pretty exciting Donald Duck adventure called for Forbidden Valley. Can you send us homes sue by reading the final panel of the story, please. Oh, okay. I don't want it. If holding, it hidden piece means I've got to smoke with those kiwi guys. I'll gladly, get it back to the indians. Awesome. Thank you guys so much. Yeah. No problem.
