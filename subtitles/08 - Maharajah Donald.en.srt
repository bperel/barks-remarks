Hello. I'm Mark Sever marino a grown man who enjoys donald dot comics,

00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:59,252
and I am joined again by a couple of other grown men.

4
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:03,247
Why don't we go with Ryan first? I'm Ryan Bailey.

5
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:07,610
I read a lot of comics, but usually with more explosions than this.

6
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:16,718
And Eric, i'm Eric hurley. I read a fair of comics with Yeah. Just five of comments. The average number of explosions.

7
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:18,154
Yeah. Excellent.

8
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:19,232
So

9
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:25,456
today for Barks Remarks, we get to talk about a pretty famous story called

10
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:27,214
Raja Donald.

11
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:30,650
I'm gonna go right into the background of this one.

12
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:42,881
This is a comic that was published in early nineteen forty seven. I don't have the exact month for this one because again, this is kind of a weird printing.

13
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,526
It was published in March of comics,

14
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:51,268
episode number four. And March of Comics was one of those

15
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:52,544
giveaway titles

16
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:54,060
that was published

17
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:55,576
made for

18
00:01:55,929 --> 00:02:02,565
stores and retailers to put their own name on the comic and and give them away to to the kiddo.

19
00:02:02,902 --> 00:02:03,402
And

20
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:04,894
So consequently,

21
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:19,322
this one is pretty rare these days because while they printed just tons and tons of copies by by the nature of the comic, parents threw them away. Kids got tired of them. So this one's pretty pretty valuable. Pretty rare.

22
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:20,318
It is

23
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:22,352
twenty eight pages

24
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:25,334
it has been reprinted quite a few times,

25
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,062
including by Gladstone comics for

26
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:36,930
free comic book day in in two thousand and three, which, they they did that deliberately because it was originally

27
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:40,215
published as a freebie delay. And

28
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:49,585
so a brief synopsis of this one. This one involves Huey, Louie trading their way up from Donald started stella a pencil

29
00:02:50,082 --> 00:03:06,058
all the way to a steam ticket to India. Donald the common the ticket and upon arriving in India, with the nephew s away becomes Mah raja for a day and immediately gets embroiled in local palace in tree regarding rivalry between two kingdoms,

30
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:20,939
prime tiger hunting real estate and very strange custom involving a sacred mobile element So this is Mah raja Donald. Al little bit of background trivia. I talked about how this one was

31
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:31,643
giveaway similar to Donald Du Adam Bomb. I I noted two when I was looking up earlier printing that the coloring for this one

32
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:33,201
had the character

33
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,120
skin

34
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:37,729
being lighten considerably on a lot of the reprint

35
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:42,937
I think the the Indian character skin was originally printed as brown,

36
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:49,920
and the sensors probably wanted to avoid an controversy with that one and that that wouldn't have been something that Carl Marx

37
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:51,398
really had much

38
00:03:52,576 --> 00:04:02,469
much say in. I mentioned that this one's very rare because of the nature sure of it's publishing. I I read somewhere that only, like, twenty one to fifty copies are known to exist.

39
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:14,529
And didn't find great information on its value, but I did see a very fine condition auction that had valued at four thousand five hundred dollar. So you guys this one had...

40
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:37,423
This opens with an old trope that I just love. And I remember seeing this in a lot of other, like, kids literature and kids media growing up, the the trade up. You know, the the the big barter, if you will. Had you guys... Did you guys remember seeing this in anything else because this was something that I saw a lot of how about you guys?

41
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:38,382
I

42
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:44,896
I have never heard of it as like a a kid game or anything like that, but I do remember in

43
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:50,189
two thousand, the one red paper guy, who got pretty famous as you try

44
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:58,688
something else and he traded that for something else. I mean I looked him up heated did fourteen trades and went from a paper clip to a house in in Canada.

45
00:04:59,166 --> 00:04:59,666
And

46
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:02,777
and so I thought oh, that's cool. But this is like

47
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:15,061
fifty years before that. I looked it up and that guy was from... It was from two thousand five to thousand six. That's I totally forgot about. Guy. You just brought that back for me. Cool. How about you, Eric. The other one

48
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,499
for all those

49
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:30,774
is the classic office episode where they have garage sale and the dwight his whole goal is to trade up. And he goes say like some pencil pen or something eat. Ends up trading it up to

50
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:32,974
everybody else and he gets the telescope

51
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:37,254
yeah it's the best item there and then, of course, some classic fashion

52
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:42,339
jim place trained on traits and magic beans. We see quotes

53
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:45,784
for the telescope, and it's it's a great episode

54
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:59,933
but it as that whole training up a training up concept and Dwight explains the you're beginning. So that's right. I'd forgotten about that. Too. Does he actually start with a a pen or a pencil? A terribly starts with, but nice.

55
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:07,610
Alright. So a little bit of the background, you guys know that I I really like to talk about the historical context

56
00:06:08,387 --> 00:06:09,585
that these came out of.

57
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:10,779
And

58
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:15,053
this one is, like especially fascinating to me because

59
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:20,584
Barks created a story in August of nineteen forty six.

60
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:21,464
And

61
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,804
again, it was published in nineteen forty seven.

62
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:27,555
I don't know exactly the

63
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:34,461
the month just because it was published for the giveaway. But nineteen forty seven is a very

64
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:35,514
significant

65
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:36,392
date

66
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,207
in India.

67
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:44,989
Do you guys happen to know or when a hazard to guess about nineteen forty seven in India? It's

68
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,866
out the brits. That that is Indian

69
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:52,794
independence. Yes. So to me, it's crazy that this

70
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:55,270
kind of came out right as everything

71
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:56,109
was

72
00:06:56,447 --> 00:07:04,108
was going on in India. The the I read that the Indian independence movement and hated been building for a long time, obviously,

73
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,340
but this is when it culminated in nineteen forty seven. The partition

74
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:16,995
happened in forty seven. And so the interesting thing is India before the partition and before

75
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:17,935
independence,

76
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,570
had... I looked at up about five hundred and eighty four prince

77
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,470
states or also called native states.

78
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:36,239
Which were not fully and formally part of British India. So you you really did have Al these little

79
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:37,077
relatively

80
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:38,516
tiny kingdoms

81
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:42,684
that were mostly autonomous. And then basically after the brits

82
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:44,723
partition India.

83
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:48,558
Everyone kind of fell in line all of the states either

84
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:52,884
decided to become part of India or Pakistan

85
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:55,795
or we're basically concord and we're annexed

86
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:56,850
by one early.

87
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:03,586
So I I found it really interesting that obviously, this is a like, out there story as far as...

88
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:11,258
I don't think it is really trying to understand Indian deal geopolitics or anything like that. But

89
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:16,601
it's crazy to think of India basically having these little kingdoms.

90
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:20,344
And then I'm curious, do you guys know anything about, like, the term,

91
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:24,124
Once again. No. So Mah,

92
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:27,524
I mean, obviously, from context, it's a ruler

93
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:28,739
in India.

94
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,059
I I did a little bit of a dive into it, Mah har literally means great prints

95
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:42,305
from Sand script. So the mah part means great and raj eyes like king or a prince. So I'm Al a really exalted

96
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:46,906
can. And and I learned that it comes from Pro ind European,

97
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:51,590
the same root word as the English word much, Behind much.

98
00:08:52,243 --> 00:09:04,001
So I thought that was interesting. And then it you know, Carl Barks really liked using Mah har raj does in his stories. He had to he a bunch of them and in different gag stories. So

99
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:06,154
anyway, some interesting stuff

100
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:16,062
notable appearance in this one, we don't really have any ongoing characters apart from the depths will make additional appearances. We have... I'd say the mah

101
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,498
Pup pad

102
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:18,630
is the most

103
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:20,306
notable character.

104
00:09:20,963 --> 00:09:21,663
And then

105
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,811
I wanted this episode I wanted to kind start to acknowledge

106
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:27,542
the different versions

107
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:39,100
of the Ducktales that we get in some of these. Because I think Donald stands out in this one is this is a pretty, like selfish version of Donald. It's very opposition between him and the nephews

108
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,000
for a lot of the story.

109
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:42,595
He's not really

110
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:52,440
concerned about them for a lot of it except in as much as it affects him. And I think that's pretty different. From some of the other ones we've read where they've been

111
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:56,825
less in conflict with each other. You guys have any

112
00:09:57,441 --> 00:09:57,755
thoughts

113
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:00,515
before I go into

114
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:02,215
the plot summary.

115
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,815
No. No. Not yet. Alright. Well good.

116
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:08,126
And as always, if you have any

117
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:13,534
thoughts in between parts of this sequence, feel free to interject. So

118
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:26,296
this story opens up with Donald asking an nephews used to clean out the garage. He promises to give them some of the junk that he doesn't want. But he ultimately lets them down by giving them a stub of a pencil.

119
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:35,315
And the kids decide to see what they can make of the pencil by trading it up. And, you know, at this point, we get that classic kid empowerment

120
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:44,441
trading sequence that we were already talking about and they managed to par their pencil stud into a ball string, a knife, silver belt buckle,

121
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:57,866
eventually into a camera. And then finally a pearl that some kids dads sent him from the south seas. And I figured that that kid is definitely in for a pad when he gets home.

122
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:22,060
Oh, oh, yes. Yes is. Hey. I have one question here. Shoot. And and that is if they cleaned out the garage, and they got everything you didn't want and all the gal was a pencil. Because they just order the garage or is he just giving the busy work because he didn't wanna deal with them. Yeah. I wonder what cleaning it means because they kinda pile up side. Yeah. Yeah sweep out... You gotta sweep out the black widows windows at some point, you know.

123
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,091
Let's that's point get the dust out a little bit. Yeah. That's right. Alright. So

124
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:33,677
the kids take the pearl to jeweler to get it assessed. And they're they encounter tight

125
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,930
who sees the pearl and decides that he needs it to complete his wife's necklace.

126
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:51,105
But the nephews are really in it for the trading. So they tell him that they're only gonna trade for it, and he offers them the steam ticket to India that he was about to use to seek out a pearl.

127
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:54,411
They take it home and they show it off to Donald.

128
00:11:54,748 --> 00:12:00,010
And he points out that it's passage for only one, so he common Barks the tick.

129
00:12:00,623 --> 00:12:03,476
That's a very generous way of phrasing that.

130
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:06,746
Yeah. Eric move.

131
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:09,596
Yeah. He's he's a pretty big jerk.

132
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:13,946
Through most of this story, I'd say. And and I read

133
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:15,443
a Barks

134
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:22,662
a letter in researching this. It wasn't simply about this one, But I read about a letter that he sent to some

135
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:25,652
lady who had written into the comics publisher

136
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:26,489
complaining

137
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:28,059
about how

138
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:29,813
Donald was

139
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:36,553
or he told his nephews to shut up or something like that. And he kinda roasted her and

140
00:12:37,384 --> 00:12:43,945
said that, you know, these this was how Donald and the kids have gotten more popular than mickey mouse

141
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,946
in their cartoon shorts. In the late forties

142
00:12:48,323 --> 00:12:55,813
and current fifties. So I think really, some of some of that conflict is just timing keeping with the cartoons.

143
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:02,660
So anyway, on the day that Donald is to set sail he makes it clear that the nephews need to stay at their grandma

144
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:07,048
and they asked if they can send him off with some bond voyage baskets.

145
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:15,516
And so aboard the ship, Donald gets settled into his cabin, any he eyeballs the lavish fruit baskets f and nephews

146
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:20,657
have sent, which have some very suspiciously plate stray fruits and pineapples.

147
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:29,344
He poke one of the pineapples with a Pin and figures out that indeed, the nephews have s away. I like

148
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:31,301
their the consistent

149
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,299
ingenuity that they have

150
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,635
of making the best of this situation.

151
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:38,187
Regardless of how much

152
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:42,143
donald uses there labor and steals from them.

153
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:56,607
Yeah. And they don't really seem to to put off when he deals deals with them like that. I really liked as a kid, I really liked just the look of those fake fruit baskets. I thought they look awesome.

154
00:13:57,046 --> 00:14:10,355
And in a lot of her it is. Yeah. Alright. So Donald Ponder what he's gonna do about the nephew s away. And while he's doing that, the ticket purse arrives and nephew have to hide back in their bass.

155
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:12,985
And while donald

156
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:19,902
distracted the first decides. He's been swipe a pineapple because, you know, Donald obviously got a lot and he won't miss it.

157
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,133
So he

158
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:25,326
he inadvertently catches one of the nephews.

159
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:28,600
And I I really like the

160
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:30,476
the panel where

161
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:35,121
he reacts to lifting the nephew up by his pineapple

162
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:41,964
and the nephew is, like, silently praying that he's not not caught. I i know Cool. Alright.

163
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:50,968
I didn't catch that. I didn't catch that's pretty he was doing. I love I love the idea. I'm just, like, please don't notice that there is a dot hanging from this time.

164
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:53,645
Yeah. And

165
00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:59,572
so the purse accuses Donald of harbor s, but Donald just

166
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:00,851
completely dis

167
00:15:01,229 --> 00:15:04,686
his nephews. Claiming he's never seen the his life. And

168
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,409
So as for result, Huey, doing Louis have to work

169
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:15,243
during the entire voyage for their passage, and they're not gonna be allowed to shore because they don't have any passports.

170
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,238
I don't know how long

171
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:24,600
steam ship passage to India lasts, but I've gotta imagine there's a pretty long voyage. Yeah. We got...

172
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:32,815
We actually got a city in this one. I've I've I think in past podcast, I've mentioned Duck as where they're coming from. Just my memory of

173
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,435
eighties Ducktales.

174
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:35,775
Mh.

175
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:45,299
But in this one, they actually named Burbank Barks. Yeah. That's right. True Yeah. And Carl Barks will use Burbank as their

176
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,591
hometown quite a few times.

177
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:51,974
I don't know at what point he starts to refer to buck to

178
00:15:52,312 --> 00:16:00,055
because he does, but I think it might be around when he does the uncle Scrooge adventures, and then it just gets rep into it.

179
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,950
But... yeah. I mean, Barks,

180
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,450
he, you know, he was part of Disney animation. So

181
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,957
I know we spent a lot of time there. And made sense that Burbank Barks would be on his mind.

182
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:14,213
Alright. So

183
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,366
as Donald is getting ready to dis

184
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,973
ship. He realizes that the nephews have swiped his passport

185
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:24,845
and in the process of chasing him, chasing...

186
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:30,251
Oh, yes. His think then they take his passport too? Yes. I.

187
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,369
He's not gonna be allowed to

188
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,247
to leave. And

189
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:38,335
they encounter while they're you know, in Chase, they encounter

190
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:42,242
an Indian man who offers to secure their passports

191
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:49,273
in return for a small favor. And, you know, this guy just ooze with suspicion.

192
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,983
He's clearing his throats suspiciously,

193
00:16:52,918 --> 00:17:04,361
basically every time he speaks. But he assures Donald that, you know, there's not gonna be anything dangerous about the task. And he asks that the Ducktales join him at his Palace in his kingdom.

194
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:35,224
And when they're really skeptical, he asks the captain to introduce him, and the cap and announces him as the Raja of Abdullah. I I love the tit tat that these deputies have with the. You know, he's like their ticket, they still wait thinking they're gonna stick him with the bill. He says no you're not. You're gonna work for. I don't know you. Maybe step working and and the, well, we're gonna take take it, so it's the stereo aspect of the relationship well not being enemies is

195
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:38,221
fantastic of just such honestly

196
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:40,355
such a family relationship.

197
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:55,265
I mean, I can't tell you how many times me and my brother to go like, yeah. Screw you. Well we ask for you too? Dang. Okay. I i'll do this. And it just continues on and onward so eventually somehow has to stop, but that that this right here covers it very well and nature that kind of relationship.

198
00:17:55,603 --> 00:18:00,627
Yeah. There's a lot of s escalation here, you know? And I think if you wanted to read into it...

199
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:03,101
I don't know, he's their uncle,

200
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:05,155
maybe they're coming terms.

201
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:18,010
We we've acknowledged that there's not really a a ton of continuity here but I do find it interesting that in some of the stories, this is the kind of relationship that they've got this very conflicted

202
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:18,928
relationship.

203
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,167
Alright. So

204
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:21,899
the docs are

205
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:23,313
encounter the

206
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:24,669
Al.

207
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:26,086
And

208
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:39,705
I didn't look it up, but I... I'm pretty sure that the Palace has basically styled after for the Taj Mahal. Do you guys know? Did you guys do that strike? He was... I would assume that's just what they... That's what people know. That's what they're gonna go with.

209
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:44,807
It... I can see it being influenced by the Taj mahal. It doesn't look particularly

210
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:50,935
like i good like this in my opinion Well, it's definitely supposed to look very, very lavish.

211
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:53,815
Yep. So the the ducks

212
00:18:54,235 --> 00:18:58,187
they they go in and they ponder what their task might be.

213
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:00,182
And then we see the mah

214
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:15,173
con kind Sneak between one of his men talking about Donald. Being perfect for the task he has in mind based on his size, so we're getting some hint of it. We're getting a hint that he's being completely set up. So the Ducktales tour the mah

215
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,123
Palace, including his j rooms,

216
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,120
which

217
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:24,085
he notes that he fills by loan gold to neighboring kingdom,

218
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:26,825
and then he accepts repayment and diamonds.

219
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:29,685
He shows them the borders of his kingdom,

220
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:40,505
and it's especially the nearby kingdom of boom pay. And he despair that they have the finest tiger hunting land but he notes that he'll own it someday.

221
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:51,720
And he reveals that he holds their mortgage and that by custom they have to make a payment every year in diamonds or in land. But he seems to leave out some detail. And so the Ducktales enjoy

222
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,286
luxurious nights And then the next morning, they dress in fine indian

223
00:19:57,744 --> 00:19:58,244
clothes.

224
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:14,648
I did also notice on this page, he mentions the first or two times in this issue, if days you could only see me now and I have not seen days you mentioned in any previous issue. Yeah. That's a good point. Daisy appears a lot in the in the ten page comics

225
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:19,497
that were large actually not gonna be talking about.

226
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:31,337
I don't think she appears in very many of the adventures stories. There's only one of them that I can think of offhand, but maybe we'll we'll come more. But, yeah. Usually,

227
00:20:31,876 --> 00:20:34,130
usually she's the subject of ten pager.

228
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,070
March even han her is the main character and some of the ten pager.

229
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,110
Alright. So the next morning they learned from another

230
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:42,283
suspiciously

231
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,043
coughing attendant that they are to meet the mah raja in his elephant yard.

232
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:51,626
And there they learned their going be riding an old sacred elephant

233
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:55,098
across the river into the capital city of Bum,

234
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,254
where they're going to find, quote

235
00:20:57,592 --> 00:21:07,316
hospitality different. From anything you expect. So Donald has has qualms. This one's kinda unique. Right? Because it's Donald to seems to have

236
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:09,948
some inkling that something's not right

237
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:20,644
instead of an nephews use. But the kids encourage him to take mah up on it. And so they they get on the elephant. And as they get across the river,

238
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:31,520
Donald Reassure him self that, you know, when he reaches the other side of the river riverbank, he can always turn back. He doesn't like the look of things. But then we cut the mah raja and he's waiting

239
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:48,231
he's aiming a big artillery gun at them and they realized that, you know, they're in for it, and they have no choice but to continue on. So I I I noticed when he when he said that you'll find the hospitality different from anything you'd ever expect struck me as

240
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:55,224
just a variation on the in all movies and Tv shows where there's some shady guy and

241
00:21:55,561 --> 00:22:00,860
he's like Can just do this thing for me. And you'll get exactly what's coming to you.

242
00:22:02,631 --> 00:22:06,194
Like oh, that's great. It's money. Right? You're gonna give me money. Yeah.

243
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,931
It says that to me, I'm gonna be like, oh, oh, you're going to kill me.

244
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:12,328
Like, no. No. No. I'm just saying.

245
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,846
You're going to you deserve

246
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:19,215
They clearly need to watch more classic television.

247
00:22:19,914 --> 00:22:20,414
Exactly.

248
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:22,771
Alright. So

249
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:42,865
they they continue to ride the elephant but, of course, they don't have any choice. And and route, we see that they're definitely passing through some of that prime tiger hunting land because they have to fend off a tiger attack, which the nephews do very briefly. While Donald stays hidden,

250
00:22:43,285 --> 00:22:49,905
and they point out how lucky he is that they didn't stay at their grandma after Al. And

251
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:53,074
Eventually, they're gonna arrive in the kingdom of.

252
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:59,061
But first, we we kinda do a a preview cut and we see Bump royal tax collector

253
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:02,035
and they're regal compile of the deficit,

254
00:23:03,455 --> 00:23:11,090
talking about the terms of their loan. And and this this is very Barks seeing to me these, like, over the top titles,

255
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,850
and I love it. I love those... I love their

256
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,770
their

257
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,030
their jobs.

258
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:24,402
And so they we we kinda learned that the terms of their loan dictate that if this mobile elephant

259
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:26,090
returns with

260
00:23:26,668 --> 00:23:33,475
someone very small. They may have to surrender more of their tiger land. They haven't learned exactly the details though

261
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:36,845
So the Ducktales arrived and they get greeted

262
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:40,485
with all this like, pom and ceremony,

263
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:41,525
but

264
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:45,397
the men are just sc with the whole time. Wall Greek.

265
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:47,652
Kinda funny. But.

266
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:50,623
How do they write a mortgage this way? You know?

267
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:51,660
Right.

268
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:58,081
I understand it's all a plot device to get Donald in Peril, but

269
00:23:58,499 --> 00:24:02,086
before we... Do you have a person yet but it weighs. You

270
00:24:02,423 --> 00:24:06,232
say out can involved. It's like there's culture, there's an any culture

271
00:24:06,689 --> 00:24:11,749
or supposedly culture i suppose that i no idea how close assistant. Anything they actually

272
00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:13,224
did back then.

273
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:19,517
Or those kingdoms ever everyday. But then tie it into a modern mortgage. If right,

274
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:20,536
hilarious.

275
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:27,921
Yeah. It it's super convoluted. And I think there's a little bit of hand waving about... You know, how how those foreigners

276
00:24:28,753 --> 00:24:29,572
do things

277
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:35,679
because, you know, people travel less for all you know. This could be true. But it's definitely

278
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:37,949
it's definitely a funny set up.

279
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:41,886
Alright. So this is where Donald gets to learn

280
00:24:42,385 --> 00:24:50,885
what's going on. I he he finds out that because he's writing the mobile Ellis and he is now the raja of Bump.

281
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,747
And of course, because he's donald duck, he, you know, swell up with pride immensely

282
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,500
and they lead Donald around his new Kingdom. They show off to him.

283
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:13,548
This is gonna be that second time that he mentions Daisy and the context of Daisy could only see me out. And then we got a great gag shot of him learning that he has a hare of lives

284
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,120
He also

285
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,520
meets his army of three soldiers.

286
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,775
I guess, I guess, fewer soldiers, but then why

287
00:25:21,552 --> 00:25:26,878
And then finally, he gets to sit down to his lunch, which he initially believes to be caviar,

288
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:32,355
but turns out to be Barks shot. And when he asked what's asks what's going on.

289
00:25:32,852 --> 00:25:37,698
He finds out the specifics of this weird convoluted mortgage scheme.

290
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:46,675
But pays mah has to be weighed once every year and if he doesn't weigh as much as a hundred pounds of diamonds,

291
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,190
which by my math is a hundred pounds.

292
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,990
But then bump is loud.

293
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,230
If if he weighs hundred pounds, they're allowed to pay their interest in diamonds

294
00:25:56,664 --> 00:26:00,453
But if not, they get more of their Tiger land fore closed on.

295
00:26:01,171 --> 00:26:09,353
And then Donald further learns that This is not an option. And if he doesn't make the way he's gonna be fed to the royal tigers,

296
00:26:09,852 --> 00:26:13,405
and there's no escape What do you guys think of this

297
00:26:13,945 --> 00:26:16,025
this scheme between gum and?

298
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:27,515
Well, I mean, on the price side, they was specify the quality of the diamonds, Just a hundred pounds. I mean, you can have

299
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:28,325
just

300
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:42,590
s low quality, you know, keep all the license for yourselves, but just go for the the worst possible diamonds you can have. But that's thinking. Yeah. That's true. I don't think the mah really cares about the diamonds

301
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:47,556
judging from how he talked about him how sick of them he is. Alright. So

302
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:57,624
I'm trying to figure out who the bad guy in the story is. Because I'm not sure it's would've tricked four ones that Are gonna feel with the tires. I mean, my instinct is that it's donald.

303
00:26:58,043 --> 00:27:01,714
Yeah. I would say everyone but the nephews probably and story it's the villain.

304
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:03,991
Yeah.

305
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:16,895
That's something that I'm gonna talk about when when I when we reflect on the one because that definitely came to mind. Alright. So Donald Donald calls out to He doing Louie, and he explains what's going on

306
00:27:17,474 --> 00:27:19,371
and that he desperately needs their help.

307
00:27:20,428 --> 00:27:24,720
And so they ponder possible solutions and ultimately, they ask

308
00:27:25,338 --> 00:27:29,730
for a bag of gold dust. To be sent up because, you know, he is the mara raja,

309
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,170
even if he's definitely gonna be fed tigers.

310
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:38,179
And they I think I thought this was very clever. You know, they sift it into his feathers,

311
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:45,038
and they managed to get his weight up to ninety eight pounds. So they just have a couple pounds to make up.

312
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:52,640
Grabs what he thinks is a hose, a water hose, and that mcdonald's drink two pounds of water.

313
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:53,793
Unfortunately,

314
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:56,939
he fails to notice that it's a gas outlet.

315
00:27:57,315 --> 00:27:59,586
And we get a little bit of cartoon logic here.

316
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,300
Because it does not... It does not kill donald,

317
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,460
but rather he is tighter than air

318
00:28:07,775 --> 00:28:11,555
And when the way it arrives, they find him floating mid air.

319
00:28:12,655 --> 00:28:13,395
And the mara

320
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:19,010
Abdullah, he's also there to witness the way in. And he sees him tied to the scales

321
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,630
and ultimately weigh in at sixty pounds less than nothing.

322
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:31,366
So, you know, they're their worst fears of them true. They're gonna lose their tiger lands. And oh, yeah they have to feed

323
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,615
feed their my to the tigers.

324
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:40,610
And then one of the bump money men, he hopes out loud that something awful falls on the.

325
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:50,800
And we get some nice comic timing where Donald deflate in that moment and he lands right on him. And he... You know, probably because

326
00:28:53,054 --> 00:28:56,904
And then I like this sequence where the Al set

327
00:28:57,282 --> 00:28:57,782
announces

328
00:28:58,175 --> 00:28:59,115
to the citizenry,

329
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:03,315
the the imminent feeding of their exalted Raja to the tigers.

330
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:07,135
And they encourage them to rush the box office for tickets.

331
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:18,713
And then the that piece kicked out of the palace so that they don't try to interfere with things. Yeah. That's a great weight loss program and she can just, you know, suck some gas. And just often

332
00:29:19,252 --> 00:29:20,471
waist sixty pounds

333
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:21,989
later than nothing.

334
00:29:22,448 --> 00:29:26,556
Yeah. Hear once you stop sucking the gas down the way comes all back.

335
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,664
Alright. There wins.

336
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:35,984
We get use. They're they're despair, but they don't count have any options

337
00:29:36,962 --> 00:29:42,435
until they stumble upon another stub of pencil and they decide that they're rich.

338
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,110
And so we got a nice book ended trading sequence

339
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,310
where

340
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,730
they're gonna trade up the pencil into something to help their uncle.

341
00:29:52,384 --> 00:29:52,884
And

342
00:29:53,341 --> 00:30:05,350
they they trade first the pencil to an old man, they convince that that he can use it to darken his beard for a good lock charm. And then they trade that a minor bird from a man that they call Pun punjab.

343
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:11,762
And then they trade that to a British colonial list on his way back to England. For his bin,

344
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:28,565
and then we kinda skip ahead like we did the first time. Ultimately, they land at five hundred pounds of cats boot. And they Barks. They parked the card outside the royal tiger pin and start to toss it all in. I I did like this. This was a good

345
00:30:29,185 --> 00:30:32,885
a good, like, both a callback to the beginning and

346
00:30:33,305 --> 00:30:51,227
I could show up their own clever the, you know, the one red Paper clip thing is just a satisfying concept on its own. It's just satisfying to watch it. Yeah. I agree. I really like the the book trading here. Well, as i say normally in these touch stories, it's there's some kind of convoluted goo

347
00:30:51,860 --> 00:31:03,559
the story that just kind of falls on the wayside. But this one, it's actually really good for foreshadowing of this how they do it and the fact that the board basically say, they they don't think there's zero pessimism with a pencil.

348
00:31:04,177 --> 00:31:20,121
Yes. We're doing it. They can say not wanna yeah. We can do that again, like, nope we got this down. We are master traders Al this. Yeah. There there are a lot of good callbacks in this one. Right? Because they they call back the joke about staying at Grandma's house a couple of times.

349
00:31:21,057 --> 00:31:34,360
And that they that Barks goes back to, you know, he sets up Daisy, and then he refers to it again. It's it's good rules of comedy. He's he's really following there. Alright. So in the morning, Donald is forced into

350
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:35,599
the coli

351
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:38,356
where the crowd gonna watch him be

352
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:47,841
But of course, the the tiger's w out and they're just too over fed to even give them a second look. And everyone is just disgusted

353
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:50,807
with their terrible terrible mah.

354
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:56,188
They're so disgusted that the money men asked what it's gonna take to

355
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,118
just get him out of the country. And

356
00:31:59,497 --> 00:32:06,130
Donald, you know, initially doesn't ask enough, buddy he ultimately fin first class Huey, tickets where he doing louie.

357
00:32:06,705 --> 00:32:12,605
And on their voyage back home, they agree that they are all even. And that

358
00:32:13,025 --> 00:32:14,865
is mah raja Donald.

359
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:16,696
Alright. So

360
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:21,421
we're gonna talk about how we felt about this one separately.

361
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:27,722
I'm gonna ask you guys to give your opinion, but I do wanna talk first about kind of the general consensus.

362
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:31,757
As always, we like to check the index

363
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:38,290
website that's tracks user reviews for all disney comic stories. So it gives a good aggregate

364
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,150
idea.

365
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,130
And

366
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,985
this one, you might be surprised

367
00:32:43,365 --> 00:32:45,543
for you or you might not. I don't know.

368
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:57,310
This one is rated very, very highly. This is a very well regarded story of Barks it has a seven point seven out of ten on the index page,

369
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:06,960
which puts it right now at one hundred and sixty four. Out of the almost forty one thousand disney comic stories that are rated.

370
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:10,975
Good enough for the top ninety nine point six.

371
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:12,089
Percentile

372
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:13,887
of all stories.

373
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:17,543
And I think we're eight episodes in now.

374
00:33:18,382 --> 00:33:19,895
And so we've got

375
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:33,070
yeah. This is our ninth story because of of course last one was a two for. And so this is actually the second best regard out of all the stories that we've done by kind of the general fandom

376
00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:35,902
The only one that's higher and it's just by

377
00:33:36,534 --> 00:33:52,421
very small fraction would be terror of the river. Is still our best regarded story that we we've done. So I I find it really interesting that this one is so highly regarded because this one's not really one of my favorites.

378
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:56,775
But I guess, I guess it does fall into some of the classic,

379
00:33:57,355 --> 00:34:02,350
you know, things that people do love about Carl Barks stories, which is some of those

380
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:03,470
adventures

381
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,750
in really far flung places.

382
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:14,585
Some of that kinda happens stands where the the or kind of fish out of water and become embroiled and something bitter.

383
00:34:15,105 --> 00:34:16,245
I personally

384
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:19,619
I do love the trading sequences.

385
00:34:19,998 --> 00:34:21,337
That book that book

386
00:34:21,796 --> 00:34:23,873
this story. I thought they were great.

387
00:34:24,473 --> 00:34:39,884
I remember just loving it as a kid and coming back to that part. On the hold, though, I don't really like how cool donald is to the nephews using this one. And like, most of the peripheral characters and the story are also really un like.

388
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:46,651
I mean, it's it's very za and it's it's a very weird and intriguing like plot device.

389
00:34:46,989 --> 00:35:00,374
So it's definitely interesting. But I remember finding this very off putting as a kid. You know, This was in the collection that I had. They hard bound collection. I think this was the one out of the ten or so stories that I read least.

390
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:09,315
I do still find this one a bit off putting as an adult, and I also have a hard time getting past some of the kind of orient

391
00:35:10,212 --> 00:35:15,541
trapping things of it. Although I do think it doesn't... It... It's not as bad as somewhere

392
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:18,992
of that time in regards to how it it treats

393
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:31,991
South Asia. So that that's my thoughts on this one. Eric, how about you? What did you think of this story? Well, I mean, when you talked about how the depiction... Yeah. This certainly is

394
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:41,651
you know, I seen the eye raising, but he kinda show like, yeah, that was the time there wasn't Al lot of understanding of other cultures and we making a lot of stuff could do need come on

395
00:35:42,588 --> 00:35:45,842
but but still being, you know, that's still being ridiculous

396
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:58,703
as comic should be. But I I obviously... As I read through it, I like I can see what I'm donald on the and the Al the serial aspect of it. I didn't like that coming to terms at the end would you remembered, hey, get my nephews

397
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:14,276
these things and in me and having him say, hey, guys. Hey. We're on it. We'll be work you know, we we we we fight bigger but we're family and we're gonna save you And I thought I thought it was well written just like you take earlier, just the whole beginning the the reoccurring jokes

398
00:36:14,616 --> 00:36:17,291
still kinda to head wrap my head around the hard who legally

399
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:21,571
needed to make a mortgage of pay by diamonds or hydra land,

400
00:36:21,911 --> 00:36:31,329
which I don't think tigers... I'm not minor understanding ky they need a lot more land than that to roam but if it could story it gets the story. So.

401
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,421
I I liked it. I I it didn't have a lot of the jumps of logic of,

402
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:38,941
say the

403
00:36:39,415 --> 00:37:04,056
Scrooge little gobble people that live in the swamp and make you forget. I mean, which are very entertaining, but this seems like a classic, you know, fish out of water, you know, that's out of country story and that's the they way be Barks on. Right on. So we're so we're you to surprised that this one is as well regarded as it is. No. I'm I'm I'm not surprised. I I can see. I certainly see what people would like it and how it how it works out.

404
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:19,718
With its writing and portrayal is it pretty much stick to their portrayal and and some fashion of donald getting screwed and the nephew you saving right on. How about you Ryan? What what were your opinions of this one? There were aspects of it. I liked.

405
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:22,548
None of them had anything to do with the

406
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,320
time in in the other country. So, yeah, I guess just kind of the nephews

407
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:35,754
clever and just kind of the way they handle all the different situations, I thought was really appealing thing donald be awful to them as their only caregiver.

408
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:37,320
I thought was pretty

409
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,280
disheartening.

410
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:53,988
And then... But but most of all, like, the this society, I guess, we'll call them an Indian society, because that's what we're going for here. They're so they're so bizarre. Like, if it didn't have to be indians. And it I think it would have made more sense if it was not if it was like martian

411
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,353
or like some kind of weird magical

412
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,462
society from travels or whatever that doesn't follow any logical

413
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:04,195
rules are in there in their cultural

414
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:08,136
makeup up there because because these guys are so weird.

415
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:15,712
It's so so weird. And, like, at the end, at the end when they're like, what would it take to get you to leave the country? I was like, well

416
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:23,817
he wanted to leave earlier, while I just let him leave earlier, you took him prisoner and then you're going to execute him for not being heavy enough

417
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:27,263
just some innocent guy that some other guy sent over there.

418
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:51,967
Like what I think the execution was, like their consolation prize. Right? Like, we know he's gonna fail us, at least we can have this entertainment of watching and get eaten. But but I agree, it's not really recognizable human being. I mean, it's not even like like, he had committed a crime or something. Like, he was just a guy it was just some guy. Never were able to leave railroad into it. It's too like. Let's kill him

419
00:38:52,423 --> 00:39:01,010
like and like, why did it why so like the tigers. I'm picturing like, the tigers or the Supreme court, and they they are the ones who decide if he lives or dies.

420
00:39:01,685 --> 00:39:08,400
The Tiger so like know, this guy's fine, this guy gets to live and they go okay. Well, we'll we'll buy you some first class tickets back home

421
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:11,034
And does he retain a title?

422
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:16,516
I mean, he's not like easy to coast. Is he... Can you build himself or as me of the corner on her i okay?

423
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:20,144
Yeah. Think that's that's a good point. He

424
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:27,316
I get the feeling that the others all ab indicated because they eaten by Tigers. So is the raja and exile.

425
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:33,970
And if they just wanted to kill him, no other ways to kill him. You know, I mean, they could just get a guy with Al black hood and a big x.

426
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:43,815
These guys these guys have a stadium just for this, though. They... That's true. They're They do They don't have an execution to city They have a Tiger stadium. Right.

427
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:48,555
Well, anyway, I I get your points.

428
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:58,395
It sounds like you... Go ahead. And more thoughts like can't have the Russia for more than a day, like, why not send someone over a week before the way in, and he could, like...

429
00:39:58,775 --> 00:40:14,195
Even if he's gonna die, he can, like, eat some nice meals and you can make a go. Yeah. He can make a go of it and have some, you know, a good a good last run there open whatever have some kind of attempt instead of being like, we're gonna send someone over who obviously doesn't meet the terms. You have, you know,

430
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:17,590
one Al the as the

431
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,270
of

432
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:27,205
rules lawyer this and and, you know, making sure that he's showing up without time. Catch and

433
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:31,365
Let's not just kind the fact that the my of Who do

434
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:34,025
didn't have somebody in mind.

435
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,058
Until he saw him on the boat.

436
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:43,550
That's true. I mean, this was clear happened every year. So you would think Huey, have a backup somebody?

437
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:50,138
Is there no service that you is the on entourage wanna, like oh no tigers for me. Your all

438
00:40:50,677 --> 00:40:54,108
probably gonna be one of them. So it's just the interesting

439
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:56,466
product. But anyway anyway... It's just gonna

440
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:57,664
that.

441
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:04,235
That guy is the the ruler of his country. Right? Is that he's the way who holds the mortgage, and he is personally

442
00:41:04,735 --> 00:41:09,455
going out on a boat from Burbank. To Find the latest guy he can find for that boat.

443
00:41:11,745 --> 00:41:13,203
To sucker into this deal.

444
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,805
And then when, you know, when when they're sailing on there across the river there, he is

445
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:19,204
manning the howard.

446
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:23,080
Very hands on Mah.

447
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:39,541
For sure. Yeah. And, you know, I guess when you got an scheme, you know what you don't wanna trust it to be bought and rock steady. You know, you wanna take take care of it yourself, so it doesn't get screwed up. It's tighter than it's high man. You gotta... Yeah. Make sure you you close the deal. Yeah. Right.

448
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:45,236
Alright. So we've we've talked about the story. We've we've given our reflections

449
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:49,485
Let's see. Not not really a lot of appearances,

450
00:41:49,944 --> 00:41:57,575
You know, there media as popular as this one is Sparks never did that I'm aware Of never did an oil painting based on this one.

451
00:41:58,035 --> 00:42:07,296
I'm not aware of any aspect of this story being referenced and any future stories, although someone couldn't enlighten me. I didn't really find a lot

452
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:16,050
educational about this one kinda like we were getting at the the whole cons truck of the idea of India is very fan.

453
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:25,613
I wouldn't be surprised if Barks didn't use some Natural and geographic reference for some of the buildings, but beyond that, I don't think it really reflects

454
00:42:26,272 --> 00:42:26,772
anything

455
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:31,890
accurate here. About india. Favorite panels, this is always a fun feature.

456
00:42:32,864 --> 00:42:44,335
I had a number of panels I liked there were also this was one though where I noticed, there were a lot of panels that had kinda unfinished art, right, or blank backgrounds in this one. So

457
00:42:44,993 --> 00:42:52,352
I feel like he... I don't know. Maybe he was pressed for time on this one. But at any rate, I did really like the

458
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:53,747
one I mentioned

459
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,440
where the Nephew getting pulled out of the fruit basket.

460
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,360
There's a really cool panel

461
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,160
on the steam ship.

462
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,135
Just

463
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:10,115
has it sailing over where Donald was saying India. Here I come. I thought that was a really nice looking panel.

464
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:27,387
I was also very taken by the the gem room when he's showing off his piles of diamonds. And it struck me that, you know, this is kinda one of the times that Barks is tipping is hat to being very interested in characters that a mass, huge amounts of well. Right

465
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,619
introduce uncle Sp, not too far down the road.

466
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,195
And I did really like the panel that we're we're post to, I think really like where the

467
00:43:38,234 --> 00:43:47,535
Palace is revealed for the first time. But I think my favorite one is when the tit is lung at the scared elephant

468
00:43:48,151 --> 00:43:52,413
after they crossed the river, i the perspective on that one.

469
00:43:53,072 --> 00:43:59,900
I like it as a cool action shot. How about you guys? Any any panels really stand out as a favorite.

470
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:03,099
I like that one the both. The title words the

471
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:05,939
steam going across in India ga

472
00:44:06,454 --> 00:44:15,447
That's should be bigger shot. But then I I also like the one right next to it, which is now I'll like, I'll go my statement just for dinner. You see in the background

473
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:23,605
a lady standing the railing, and it looks like you can tell that the is blowing. So it's actually got some movement going on in the background and it's

474
00:44:24,305 --> 00:44:27,165
maybe the sharpest the yellow here on yellow background.

475
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,925
But it was just nice background scenery

476
00:44:30,425 --> 00:44:30,925
on

477
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,460
the boat ride, and the same one with these

478
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,260
leaving

479
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,460
before the boat when he's meeting

480
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:52,257
synced goodbye a burbank essentially, know, leaving home behind and it's this the distant shore and he's in the silhouette has perspective. I would have loved to seeing these some of these panels on a larger scale a little more finished, but you're saying would been really good. That being said,

481
00:44:52,595 --> 00:44:56,045
the image of the Fan tiger just makes me laugh time.

482
00:44:57,835 --> 00:45:05,009
How you're drilling in. Big belly tongue hanging out, low and like, no. No no. I'm good. I'm inside a funny spot lay down. Yeah.

483
00:45:06,569 --> 00:45:09,749
That you can't... That's some pretty good comedy. Those

484
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:12,009
very fat happy tigers.

485
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:17,911
And and donald the one next to it, but both of the ones that show the tigers, the wealth fed tigers

486
00:45:18,608 --> 00:45:23,399
are pretty fantastic panels with Donald just sweating profusely sleep.

487
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:26,239
How about you ryan any any?

488
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:28,554
Listen is the India here at.

489
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:31,374
I feel like it's kind of reminiscent of

490
00:45:31,754 --> 00:45:34,029
like the Japanese flag and maybe you get that kind

491
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:36,629
really nice blue on the ocean

492
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:43,204
and then and then a really dark orange sun with yellow rays coming out at different angle there,

493
00:45:43,861 --> 00:45:44,799
which is very pretty...

494
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:46,595
One yeah made chuckle,

495
00:45:46,972 --> 00:45:48,948
as I read it was when the...

496
00:45:49,366 --> 00:45:52,799
I don't know if he's a Oh, he's the the ticket taker guide. The person

497
00:45:53,139 --> 00:46:06,165
is in their room, and when he discovers the nephews and says still, I get it, then it says, so that's the setup and he he puts his J hughes finger right in donald Barks space and done like his leaning way back and he's got the finger right on his beak.

498
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:10,359
And it's it's just really great pose but

499
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:15,330
I thought with well frame. Yeah. You're you're absolutely right. That one's hilarious.

500
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:25,036
Very nice. He's got the obligatory sweat bead shooting at the side of his head. It's seems being accused to bring on so it's Oh, and then I did forget

501
00:46:25,454 --> 00:46:25,954
to

502
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:29,388
do... And then in the reflections part. I forgot to

503
00:46:29,766 --> 00:46:33,154
talk about things that might be dated or archaic versus

504
00:46:33,574 --> 00:46:42,244
retro grade. The what stood out to me is dated was it was fun to see some of the old stuff that they traded up, like, the very old style camera.

505
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:51,084
And then the idea of a young kid having a pocket knife to trade, I know that you Youtube both probably were kids who had pocket knives

506
00:46:51,662 --> 00:46:52,162
but

507
00:46:53,576 --> 00:47:15,474
not not a ton of them that age would today. And then just the idea of taking a steam to India course is very very archaic. As far as things that didn't help don't hold up well, you know, we already went into this. Obviously, the depiction of India. I mean, it's kind of a fine line. Right? Like, it's not great. It's not awesome.

508
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:18,666
But on the other hand, at least, he didn't

509
00:47:19,165 --> 00:47:21,743
try to use a car accent

510
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,154
with the character

511
00:47:24,734 --> 00:47:29,034
That is true. He did show... He did show most of them wearing turban

512
00:47:29,454 --> 00:47:36,199
and, you know, that that's a common trope, but but those are my understanding is that those are only weren't by seek people.

513
00:47:36,736 --> 00:47:38,871
And then, you know, we had some of Al very orient

514
00:47:39,248 --> 00:47:42,234
probes like har and and feeding people that.

515
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:44,154
But

516
00:47:44,454 --> 00:47:48,474
but again, on the whole, I I've I've seen worse depictions.

517
00:47:49,054 --> 00:47:53,002
I think that we have pretty much covered

518
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,918
Har Donald.

519
00:47:55,336 --> 00:47:59,244
This one was... I hear have question Mark. Yeah. Certainly. Absolutely.

520
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,561
They never got the gold off of Donald.

521
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:02,440
Hey.

522
00:48:03,018 --> 00:48:06,569
One of the greatest smuggling gag I've ever seen is

523
00:48:07,587 --> 00:48:08,087
discounts

524
00:48:08,466 --> 00:48:09,245
in gold

525
00:48:09,584 --> 00:48:11,243
and glue and

526
00:48:11,702 --> 00:48:16,089
then get around. So I just Mean, I don't know if that i gonna pay rent.

527
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:20,914
Well what. But they never... And they never saying how much, but it has

528
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:23,108
amount. They never have to build those

529
00:48:24,019 --> 00:48:33,192
run around with it. Yeah. I mean, it's it's tap glue, but still that was that was one of my takeaways at this days so came out with from a gold lining in the too.

530
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,149
Oh man.

531
00:48:35,888 --> 00:48:37,706
I you had to go there.

532
00:48:39,138 --> 00:48:44,665
That may be why they look so content lounging on those deck chairs on the way back. Excellent.

533
00:48:45,163 --> 00:48:46,479
Thank you for pointing that out.

534
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:52,575
Alright. So any other final thoughts before we wrap this one up? No. Not

535
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,010
