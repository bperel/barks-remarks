Hello. I'm Mark Sever

4
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:54,307
of Grown man who enjoys donald dot com,

00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:59,213
and I am joined again by a couple of other grown men.

6
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:03,247
Why don't we go with Ryan first? I'm ryan Bailey.

7
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:07,270
I read a lot of Thomas, but usually with more explosions than this.

8
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:09,104
And Eric,

9
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,437
eric currently. I read

10
00:01:11,894 --> 00:01:12,394
Comics

11
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:16,577
with Yeah. Just a about comments. The average number of explosions.

12
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:18,154
Yeah. Excellent.

13
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:19,192
So

14
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:27,174
today for Barks remarks, we get to talk about a pretty famous story called My raja Donald.

15
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:30,650
I'm gonna go right into the background of this one.

16
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:39,915
This is a comment that was published in early nineteen forty seven. I don't have the exact month for this one because

17
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:42,881
again, this is kind of a weird printing.

18
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,486
It was published in March of comics.

19
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:52,505
Episode number four. And March of con was one of those give giveaway titles

20
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:54,060
that was published

21
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:55,536
made for

22
00:01:55,929 --> 00:02:03,362
stores and retailers to put their own name on the comic and and give them away to to the kiddo and

23
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:04,814
So consequently,

24
00:02:05,512 --> 00:02:19,282
this one is pretty rare these these days because while they printed just tons and tons of copies by by the nature of the comic parents through them awake. Kids got tired of them. So this one's pretty pretty valuable pretty rare.

25
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:22,312
It is twenty eight pages

26
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:25,356
It has been reprinted quite a few times

27
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:29,062
including by Gems comics for

28
00:02:29,558 --> 00:02:33,240
free comment but day in i in two thousand and three,

29
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:36,930
which they they did that deliberately because it was originally

30
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:40,174
published as a free vehicle delay. And

31
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:47,855
so a brief synopsis of this one. This one involves hub redoing with trading their way up from Donald

32
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,585
discarded stub a pencil

33
00:02:50,082 --> 00:03:03,527
all the way to a steam ticket to India. Donald the command diaz the ticket and upon arriving in India, with the Nephew going away. Becomes mo raja for a day and immediately gets embroiled in local Al entry

34
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:06,058
regarding a arrival between two kingdoms,

35
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:12,122
prime tiger hunting real estate and very strange custom involving a sacred mobile

36
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:15,271
So this is Mah raja Donald.

37
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:20,939
A little bit of background trivia, I talked about how this one was

38
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:29,114
giveaway similar to Donald Du Adam Bomb. I I noted two when I was looking up earlier printing that

39
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:31,683
the coloring for this one

40
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:33,161
had the characters

41
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,729
skin being light enough considerably and a lot of the reprint

42
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:42,817
I think the the Indian character skin was originally printed as brown.

43
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:49,700
And the sensors probably wanted to avoid an controversy with that. That that wouldn't have been something that Barks

44
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:51,358
really had much

45
00:03:52,576 --> 00:04:02,584
much say in. I mentioned that this one's very rare because of the nature of its publishing. I I read somewhere that only, like, twenty one to fifty copies are known to exist

46
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:12,729
I didn't find great information on value, but I did see a verifying condition auction that had valued at four thousand five hundred dollar. So

47
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:14,489
you guys this one had...

48
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:35,984
This opens with an old trope that I just love and I remember seeing this in a lot of other, like, kids literature and kids media growing up the the trade up. You know, the the the big Barks, if you will. Had you guys... Did you guys remember seeing this in anything else? Because this was something that I saw a lot of

49
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:37,423
about you guys.

50
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:38,382
I

51
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:45,095
I have never heard of it as, like, a a kid game or anything like that, but I do remember in the

52
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:58,688
two thousand, the one red paper clip guy who got pretty famous if he tried or something else and rated that for something else. I mean, I looked him up. He did fourteen trades and went from a paper clip to a house in in Canada.

53
00:04:59,246 --> 00:04:59,746
And

54
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:02,777
and so I thought, oh, that's cool. But this is like

55
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:14,761
a few years before that. I looked it up and that guy was from... It was from two thousand five to you got six. That's. I totally forgot about. Guy. You just brought that back for me. Cool. How about you, Eric? The other one,

56
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,779
for all those office

57
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:30,734
is the classic office of episode where they have garage sale and the white, his whole goal is to trade up. And he goes saved, like some pencil or pen or something and he ends up training it up to

58
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:32,974
everybody else and he gets the telescope.

59
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:37,114
Which is the best item there. And then, of course, in plastic fashion,

60
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:42,278
gym place a crank on and magic beans, we data quotes.

61
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:45,550
For the tele. It's it's a great episode.

62
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:59,853
But it that whole trading up a training up concept and dwight explained to the compared beginning. So that's right. I had forgotten about that too. Does does he actually start with a a pen or a pencil? I can't remember believe he starts with. But nice.

63
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:06,812
Alright. So a little bit of the background, you guys know that I I really like to talk about the historical

64
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:07,889
context

65
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:09,585
that these came out of.

66
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,974
And this one is, like, especially fascinating to me because

67
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:20,324
Barks created this story in August of nineteen forty six.

68
00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:21,544
And,

69
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:24,764
again, it was published in nineteen four forty seven.

70
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:27,555
I don't know exactly the

71
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:34,461
the month just because it was published for the giveaway. But nineteen forty seven is a very

72
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:35,514
significant

73
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:36,352
date

74
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,247
in India.

75
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:47,866
Do you guys happen to know or when a hazard to guess about nineteen forty seven in India? It's may out the bridge, that that is Indian

76
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:52,794
independence. Yes. So to me, it's crazy that this

77
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:56,069
kind of came out right as everything was

78
00:06:56,487 --> 00:07:04,068
was going on in India. The the... I read that the Indian independence moving hated been building for long time, obviously,

79
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:09,340
but this is when it culminated in nineteen forty seven. The partition

80
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:13,794
happened in forty seven. And so the interesting thing is

81
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,995
India before the partition and before

82
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:17,935
independence,

83
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:23,570
had... I looked it up about five hundred and eighty four previously

84
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,470
states were also called native states.

85
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:30,384
Which were not fully and

86
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:37,038
part of British India. So you you really did have all these little relatively

87
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:37,916
tiny

88
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:42,684
that were mostly autonomous. And then basically after the bridge

89
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:44,723
partition India.

90
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:48,558
Everyone kind of fell in line, all of the states either

91
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:52,884
decided to become part of India or Pakistan

92
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:54,399
or we're basically

93
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:55,454
or or Al.

94
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:56,810
By one or.

95
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:03,547
So I I found it really interesting, that obviously, this is a, like, out their story as far as...

96
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,271
I don't think it is really trying to understand Inducks

97
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,258
geopolitics for anything like that. But

98
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:16,561
it's crazy to think of India basically having these little kingdoms.

99
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:21,084
And then I'm curious, do you guys know anything about, like, the term My.

100
00:08:22,744 --> 00:08:27,464
No. So My raja... I mean, obviously, from context, it's a ruler.

101
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,739
In India.

102
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:33,980
I I did a little bit of a dive into it. My raja literally means great prints

103
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:42,305
from Sand schmidt. So the Mo part means great and raja eyes like king or prince. So My har raja is a really exalted

104
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:43,119
king.

105
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:46,747
And and I learned that it comes from pro ind

106
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:51,590
the same root word as the English word much, My behind much.

107
00:08:52,243 --> 00:09:03,164
So I thought that was interesting. And then it, you know, Carl Barks really liked using my raj does in his story He had to... He had a bunch of them and in different gag stories.

108
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:03,979
So,

109
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,114
anyways, some interesting stuff

110
00:09:06,969 --> 00:09:16,341
notable appearances is in this one, we don't really have any ongoing characters apart from the depths will make additional appearances. We have... I'd say the raja

111
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,299
Hoop

112
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:18,630
is the most

113
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:20,266
notable character.

114
00:09:21,003 --> 00:09:21,663
And then

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,771
I wanted this episode I wanted to kinda start to acknowledge

116
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:27,502
the different versions

117
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:39,100
of the Inducks that we get in some of these because I think Donald stands out and this one is this is a pretty like, selfish version of Donald. It's very opposition between him and the nephews

118
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,960
for a lot of the story.

119
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:42,555
He's not really

120
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:52,440
concerned about them for a lot of it except in as much as it affects him. And I think that's pretty different. From some of the other ones we've read where they've been

121
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:53,277
less

122
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:56,825
conflict with each other. Do you guys have any

123
00:09:57,401 --> 00:09:57,755
thoughts

124
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,515
before I go into

125
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:02,255
the plot summary.

126
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,715
No. But not yet. Alright. Well

127
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:08,126
And as always, if you have any

128
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:13,494
thoughts in between parts of this sequence, feel free to interject. So

129
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:18,422
this story opens up with Donald asking the nephews to clean out the garage.

130
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:26,278
He promises to give them some of the junk that he doesn't want. But he ultimately lets them down by giving them a stub of a pencil.

131
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:27,235
And

132
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:35,315
the kids decide to see what they can make of the pencil by trading it up. And, you know, at this point, we get that classic kid empowerment

133
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:44,379
trading sequence that we were already talking about and they inch to par their pencil stub into a ball string, a knife, a silver belt buckle,

134
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:53,451
eventually into a camera, and then finally, a pearl that some kid's dad sent him from the south sips.

135
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,486
And I figured that that kid is definitely in for a pad when he gets home.

136
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:22,060
Oh, oh, yes. Yes is. Hey. I have one question here. Shoot. And and that is if they cleaned out the garage, and they got everything he didn't want and all they miguel was a pencil. Did they just organized the garage? Or is he just giving him a busy work because he didn't wanna deal with them? Yeah. I wonder what cleaning it means because they kinda pile Inducks about outside. Yeah. They're gonna sleep out. You gotta sleep out the black windows at some point, you know?

137
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,175
Let's that's start pulling get the dust out a little bit. Yeah. That's.

138
00:11:27,112 --> 00:11:28,051
Alright. So

139
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:33,895
the kids take the pearl to a jeweler to get an assessed, and they're they encounter type tune.

140
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,890
Who sees the pearl decides that he needs it to complete his wife's net.

141
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:51,145
But the Nephews are really in it for the trading so they tell him that they're only gonna trade for it, and he offers them the steam ship ticket to India that he was about to use to seek out a parole.

142
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:54,331
They take it home and they show it off to Donald

143
00:11:54,748 --> 00:12:00,191
and he points out that it's passage for only one. So he common gears the ticket

144
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,335
that's a very generous way of raising that.

145
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,666
Yeah. Work move.

146
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:09,795
Yeah. He's he's a pretty big jerk.

147
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:13,906
Through most of this story, I'd say. And and I read

148
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:15,443
a Barks

149
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:22,622
a letter in researching this. It wasn't simply about this one. But I read about a letter that he sent to some

150
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:26,449
lady who had written into the comics publisher complaining

151
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:27,939
about how

152
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:29,792
mean donald was,

153
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:36,553
or he told his nephews to shut up or something like that. And he kinda roasted her and

154
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:43,865
so said that, you know, these this was how Donald and the kids had gotten more popular than Mickey mouse

155
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,946
in their Barks shorts. In the late forties

156
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:55,773
and only fifties. So I think really, some of some of that conflict is just kind in keeping with the cartoons.

157
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:02,660
So anyway, on the day that Donald is to set sail, he makes it clear that the nephews need to stay at their grandma

158
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:07,008
and they ask if they can send him off with some von voyage baskets.

159
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:15,516
And so aboard the ship, Donald gets settled into his cabin, any eyeballs the lavish fruit basket that the nephews

160
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:20,476
have sent, which have some very suspiciously placed spray fruits and Al.

161
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:31,301
He poke one of the pineapples with the pin and figures out that indeed the nephews have s away. I like their their the consistent

162
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,299
ingenuity that they have

163
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,635
of making the best of their situation.

164
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,187
Regardless of how much

165
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:41,763
donald uses is there labor and deals from them.

166
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:44,875
Yeah. And they don't really seem to

167
00:13:45,254 --> 00:14:04,502
to put off when he deals deals with them like that. And I really liked as a kid, I really liked just the look of those fake fruit baskets. I thought they looked awesome. And and in Al lot room it is. Yeah. Alright. So Donald Ponder what he's gonna do about the nephew going away.

168
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:10,870
And while he's doing that, the ticket per for arrives and nephews have to hide back in their basket. It's

169
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:12,985
And while donald

170
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:20,562
distracted the purse who decides, he's gonna swipe a pineapple because, you know, Donald obviously got a lot and he won't miss it. But

171
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,093
So he

172
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:25,326
he inadvertently catches one of the nephews.

173
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:28,600
And I I really like the

174
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:35,081
the panel where he reacts to lifting the nephew up by his pineapple

175
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:41,543
and the nephew is, like, silently praying that he's not not caught I thought. You cool. K.

176
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:50,928
I didn't catch that. I didn't i said that's what he was doing. I was I love the idea. Of just like, please don't notice that there is a doc hanging from this time.

177
00:14:52,506 --> 00:14:53,685
Yeah. And

178
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:59,532
so the purse uses Donald of Harbor still away, but Donald just

179
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:04,725
completely dis allows his nephews claiming he's never seen the his life. And

180
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:08,370
So as resolve, Huey, doing Louis have to work

181
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:15,203
during the entire voyage for their passage, and they're not gonna be allowed to show because they don't have any passports.

182
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,199
I don't know how long

183
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:32,815
steam ship passage to India last, but I've gotta imagine as a pretty long voyage. Yeah. We got a... We actually got a city in this one. I've I've I think in past Podcast, I've mentioned Duck as where they're coming from. Just my memory of

184
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:35,435
eighty Ducktales cartoons. Mh.

185
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:38,555
But in this one, they actually named Burbank.

186
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:41,390
Yeah. That's right. True Yeah. And

187
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:45,259
Barks will use Burbank as their

188
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:47,591
hometown quite a few times.

189
00:15:48,349 --> 00:16:00,015
I don't know at what point he starts to refer to about to Inducks because he does. But I think it might be around when he does the uncle sp adventures. And then it just gets ra on into it.

190
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,950
But... Yeah. I mean, Barks,

191
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,450
he, you know, he was part of Disney animation. So

192
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,430
I know you spent a lot of time there.

193
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:12,297
And made sense that Burbank would be on his mind

194
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:14,093
Alright. So

195
00:16:14,711 --> 00:16:17,366
as Donald is getting ready to dis

196
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,933
ship. He realizes that the nephews have swiped his passport

197
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,805
and in the process of chasing him, Chasing.

198
00:16:25,622 --> 00:16:32,369
Oh, yeah. His think then they take his passport too. Yeah. I any know. He's not gonna be allowed to

199
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,167
to leave. And

200
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:38,255
they encounter while they're you know, in Chase, the encounter...

201
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:42,202
An Indian man who offers to secure their passports

202
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:49,252
in return for a small favor. And, you know, this guy just who with suspicion.

203
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,944
He's clearing his throats suspiciously

204
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:59,410
basically every time he speaks. But he assures Donald that, you know, there's not gonna be anything dangerous about the task.

205
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,281
And he asks that the Ducktales join him at his Al in his kingdom.

206
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:11,918
And when they're really skeptical he asks the captain to introduce him and the cap and announces him as the Meh

207
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:30,988
of Ru duo I I'd love the Tit tat that these... That have with her own. You know, he's their ticket, they still away thinking they're gonna stick him with the bill. He says no, you're not, you're gonna work for it. I don't know you. That stopped working and and they well, we're gonna take your think it... So it's the

208
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:34,025
aspect of the relationship Well not being

209
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:38,181
is fantastic of just such honestly

210
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:40,355
such a family relationship.

211
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:55,226
I mean, I can't tell you many times me and my brother gonna like, yeah. We'll screw you. Well we ask for you too. Dang. Okay. I'll do this and it just continues on working going ergonomic until you've eventually some balances Al of stop. But that that this right here covers it very well and nature of that kind of relationship.

212
00:17:55,603 --> 00:18:00,286
Yeah. There's a lot of escalation here. You know? And I think if you wanted to read into it,

213
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:03,061
I don't know. He's there uncle.

214
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:05,176
Maybe they're come to terms

215
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:18,010
we we've acknowledged that there's not really a a ton of continuity here. But I do find it interesting that in some of the stories, this is the kind of relationship that they've got this very conflicted

216
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:18,928
relationship.

217
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,167
Alright. So

218
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:22,657
the Ducktales gonna encounter

219
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:24,930
the mah raja polyps.

220
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:26,126
And

221
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:39,345
I didn't look it up, but I... I'm pretty sure that the palace is basically styled after or the taj hall. Do you guys know? Did you guys do that strike it was... I would assume. That's just what think... That's what people know that's what they're gonna go with.

222
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:44,807
It... I can see it being influenced by the Taj mahal. It doesn't look particularly.

223
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:50,895
Like I good like this in my opinion Well, it's definitely supposed to look very ornate very lavish.

224
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:53,815
Yeah. So the the that's...

225
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:58,147
They they go in and they ponder what their task might be.

226
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:15,173
And then we see the Mah con kinda sneak one of his men talking about Donald being perfect for the task he Al in mind based on his size, so we're getting some hint of it. We're getting a hint that he's being completely set up. So the docs tour the Mah

227
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,789
Al,

228
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:18,022
including his gem rooms,

229
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,120
which

230
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:24,005
he notes that he fills by learning and gold to neighboring kingdom.

231
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:26,805
And then he accepts repayment and diamonds.

232
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:29,605
He shows them the borders of his kingdom,

233
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:38,170
and a especially the nearby kingdom of Boom pay, and he despair that they have the finest Tiger Hunting land

234
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:40,405
but he notes the he'll own it someday.

235
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:51,720
And he reveals that he holds their mortgage and that by custom, they have to make a payment every year in diamonds or in land. But he seems to leave out some detail. And so the decks enjoy

236
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,246
Luxurious night. And then the next morning, they dress and fine indian

237
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:58,164
clothes.

238
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:14,608
I did also notice on this page, he mentions the first of two times in this issue, if days, you could only see me now. And I have not seen days you mentioned in any previous issue. Yeah. That's a good point. Daisy appears a lot in the in the ten page clinics

239
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:15,727
that

240
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:19,417
were large actually not gonna be talking about.

241
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:31,258
I don't think she appears in very many of the adventure stories. There's only one of them that I can think of off offhand, but maybe we'll we'll come more. But, yeah, Usually,

242
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:37,930
usually she's the subject to ten pager for. Marc even had hers as the main character and some of the ten pager.

243
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,110
Alright. So the next morning, they learned from another

244
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,638
suspiciously coughing attendant

245
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:46,963
that they are to meet them on raja in his elephant yard.

246
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:51,626
And they're they learned their gonna be riding Al old sacred elephant

247
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:55,418
across the river into the Capital City of Pay,

248
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,254
where they're gonna find quote

249
00:20:57,592 --> 00:21:00,425
hospitality different. From anything you expect.

250
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:07,276
So Donald has has qualms. This one's kinda unique. Right? Because it's Donald who seems to have

251
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:09,908
some ink inkling that something's is not right

252
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:11,122
instead of an nephews.

253
00:21:11,641 --> 00:21:20,462
But the kids encouraged him to take my raja up on it. And so they they get on the elephant. And as they get across the river,

254
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:31,520
donald reassure him itself that, you know, when he reaches the other side of the River Barks, he can always turn it back. He doesn't like the look of things. But then we cut Mah raja, and he's waiting

255
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:48,231
he's aiming a big artillery gun at them, and they realized that, you know, they're in for it, and they have no choice but to continue on. So I I I noticed when he... When he said that... You'll find the hospitality different from anything. You'd ever expect. Struck me as as

256
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:54,347
just a variation on the... In all movies and Tv v shows where there's some shady guy,

257
00:21:54,804 --> 00:22:00,820
and he's like, and just do this thing for me. And do get exactly what's coming to you.

258
00:22:02,631 --> 00:22:06,034
Like, oh, that's great this money. Right? You're gonna give me money? Yeah.

259
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,551
Says that to me. I'm gonna be like, oh, oh, you're going to kill me.

260
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:12,328
Like, no No. No. I'm just saying.

261
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,846
You're going to get you deserve.

262
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:19,215
They clearly need to watch more classic television.

263
00:22:19,914 --> 00:22:20,414
Exactly.

264
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:22,731
Alright. So

265
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:37,470
they they continue to ride the elephant, but globe of course, they don't have any choice and en root, we see that they're definitely passing through some of that Prime Tiger hunting land because they have to fend off a Tiger attack,

266
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,665
which the nephews do very bravely. While Donald

267
00:22:42,005 --> 00:22:42,825
stays hidden,

268
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:49,785
and they point out how lucky he is that they didn't stay at their grandma after all. And

269
00:22:50,698 --> 00:22:56,885
Eventually, they're gonna arrive in the kingdom of pay, but first, we we kinda do a a preview cut, and we see

270
00:22:57,563 --> 00:22:59,061
Royal tax collector

271
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:01,995
and their regal compile of the deficit,

272
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:11,050
talking about the terms of their loan. And and this this is very Barks Severino to me, these, like, over the top titles,

273
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,810
and I love it. I love those. Al love their

274
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:15,730
their

275
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,130
their jobs

276
00:23:17,603 --> 00:23:22,090
And so they... We we kinda learned that the terms of their loan

277
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,402
dictate that if this mobile elephant

278
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:25,239
returns

279
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:26,090
with

280
00:23:26,668 --> 00:23:33,014
someone very small, they may have to surrendering more of their tiger land. They haven't weren't exactly the details though.

281
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:36,765
So the arrived and they get greeted

282
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:40,445
with all this, like pump and ceremony,

283
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:41,485
but

284
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:45,697
the manager are just sc with the whole time. While they greet them.

285
00:23:46,115 --> 00:23:47,133
Kinda funny

286
00:23:47,671 --> 00:23:50,583
home... How they write a mortgage this way? You know?

287
00:23:51,994 --> 00:23:52,494
It's...

288
00:23:52,912 --> 00:23:58,081
I I understand it's all a plot device to get donald in payroll, but

289
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:01,807
before you have a person yet that it weighs

290
00:24:02,463 --> 00:24:11,710
figured i involved. It's like, there's culture... There's ancient culture here or supposed culture I suppose, that i no idea how close is anything they actually

291
00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:13,184
did back then

292
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:18,380
Or those Inducks did but they tied it into a modern mortgage

293
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:19,538
it's like

294
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:20,536
hilarious.

295
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:27,881
Yeah. It it's super convoluted. And I think there's a little bit of hand waving about you know how how those foreigners

296
00:24:28,713 --> 00:24:29,572
do things.

297
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:35,639
Because, you know, people travel less for all you know, this could be true. But it's definitely...

298
00:24:36,137 --> 00:24:38,090
It's definitely a funny set up.

299
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:41,806
Alright. So this is where Donald gets to learn

300
00:24:42,385 --> 00:24:49,649
what's going on. And he he finds out that because he's writing the mobile ls sent. He is now the Mah

301
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:50,885
of Be.

302
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,747
And, of course, because he's Donald Inducks, he, you know, swell up with pride immensely.

303
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,720
And they donald around his new kingdom,

304
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,680
they show off to him

305
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:09,564
This is gonna be that second time that he mentions Daisy and the context stuff Daisy could only see me now. And then we got a great

306
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:13,468
gag shot of him learning that he has a hair of lives

307
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,080
He also

308
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,520
meets his army of three soldiers.

309
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,775
I guess, I guess, fewer soldiers or than why

310
00:25:21,632 --> 00:25:26,878
and finally, he gets to sit down to his lunch, which he initially believes to be caviar

311
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:32,315
but turns out to be bucks shot. And when he asked what's asks what's going on,

312
00:25:32,812 --> 00:25:36,302
he finds out the specifics of this weird convoluted

313
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:37,618
mortgage scheme

314
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:46,675
But my raja has to be weighed once every year, and if he doesn't weigh as much as a hundred pounds of diamonds,

315
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,150
which by my math is a hundred pounds

316
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,910
But then bump is Al allowed

317
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,050
If you if he weighs hundred her pounds, they're allowed to pay their interest in diamonds.

318
00:25:56,664 --> 00:26:00,453
But if not, they get more of their tiger and for closed on.

319
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:03,560
And then Donald further learns that

320
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:05,598
This is not an option.

321
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:09,313
And if he doesn't make the way, he's gonna be fed to the royal Tigers,

322
00:26:09,852 --> 00:26:13,405
and there's no escape What what do you guys think of this

323
00:26:13,945 --> 00:26:16,745
this scheme between Dump and Poo do?

324
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:27,475
Well, I mean, price side, they'll specify the quality of the diamonds, just a hundred pounds. I mean, you can have

325
00:26:27,812 --> 00:26:28,312
just

326
00:26:29,102 --> 00:26:42,550
s low quality, you know, keep all the nice for yourselves, but just go for the the worst possible things you can have. But That's thinking. Yeah. That's true. I don't think the my raja really cares about the diamonds

327
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:47,556
judging from how we talked about him how sick of them he is. Alright. So

328
00:26:48,172 --> 00:26:57,545
I'm trying figure out who the bad guy the story is. Because I'm not sure if it's would've trick corporate ones that i with the tigers. I mean, my instinct is that it's Donald.

329
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:01,533
I would say everyone, but the nephews probably in the story is the billing?

330
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:03,571
Yeah.

331
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:16,895
That's something that I'm gonna talk about when when I when we reflect on this one because that definitely came in mind. Alright. So, Donald, Donald calls out to He doing Louie, and he explains what's going on

332
00:27:17,474 --> 00:27:19,111
and that he desperately needs their help.

333
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:24,680
And so they ponder possible solutions, and ultimately, they ask

334
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:29,370
for a bag of gold dust. To be sent up because, you know, he is the Modi,

335
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,130
even if he's definitely gonna be fetched tigers.

336
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:38,139
And they... I think I thought this was very clever. You know, they sift it into his feathers.

337
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:44,658
And they managed to get his weight up to ninety eight pounds. So they just have a couple pounds to make up.

338
00:27:45,535 --> 00:27:52,640
He Kiwi grabs what he thinks is a hose, a water hose, and to donald drink two pounds of water.

339
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:53,793
Unfortunately,

340
00:27:54,209 --> 00:27:59,506
he fails to notice that it's a gas outlet left. And we get a little bit of cartoon logic here.

341
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,160
Because it does not... It does not kill donald.

342
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,240
But rather he is been lighter than there,

343
00:28:07,815 --> 00:28:11,455
And when the way arrives, they find him floating mid air.

344
00:28:12,655 --> 00:28:14,315
And the Mah shah Pad,

345
00:28:14,655 --> 00:28:18,970
he's also there to witness the way in and he sees him tied to the scales

346
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,510
and ultimately weigh in Al sixty pounds less than nothing.

347
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:31,366
So, you know, they're they're worst tears of them true. They're gonna lose their tiger land. And oh yeah, they have to feed

348
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,615
feed their aura raja to the tigers.

349
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,410
And then one of the

350
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:41,010
money men, he hopes out loud that something awful falls on the Mont raja.

351
00:28:42,205 --> 00:28:50,505
And we get some nice comic timing Donald def deflate in that moment and and lands right on him. And he... You know, and brought

352
00:28:53,054 --> 00:28:57,782
And then I liked this sequence where the Al set bumper announces

353
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:03,275
to the citizenry Re, the the imminent feeding of their exalted Raja to the tigers.

354
00:29:03,895 --> 00:29:07,055
And they encourage them to rush the box office for tickets.

355
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:18,673
And then the nephews used get kicked out of the palace so that they don't try interfere with things. Yeah. That's a great weight loss program and you could just, you know, suck some gas. And just often

356
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:20,431
weigh sixty pounds

357
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:21,809
later than nothing.

358
00:29:22,408 --> 00:29:26,517
Yeah. Hear once you stop sucking the gas down the way it comes all back.

359
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,624
Alright. So there williams.

360
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:35,904
We not use they're they're despair that they don't have any options

361
00:29:36,882 --> 00:29:42,550
until they stumble upon another stu of pencil and they decide that they're rich

362
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,070
And so we get a nice book ended trading sequence

363
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,310
where

364
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,690
they're gonna trade up the pencil into something to help their uncle.

365
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:52,804
And

366
00:29:53,341 --> 00:30:05,130
they they trade first the pencil to an old man. They convince some that that he can use it to Barks his beard for a good luck charm. And then they trade that for a minor bird from a man that they call P job.

367
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:11,483
And then they trade that to a British colonial list on his way back to England. For his,

368
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:28,565
and then we kinda skip ahead like we did the first time. Ultimately, they land at five hundred pounds of cats move. And they Barks. They parked the card outside the royal tiger Pan and start to toss it all in. I I did like this. This was a good

369
00:30:29,185 --> 00:30:32,925
a good... like, both a callback to the beginning and

370
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:50,588
a good show of their own clever the, you know, the one that paper clip thing is just a satisfying concept on its own. It's just satisfying to watch it. Yeah. I agree. I really like the the book trainings here. Well, As just say normally, in these dutch stories, since there's some kind of convoluted

371
00:30:51,365 --> 00:31:03,559
that's it's a story that just kinda falls on the wayside side. But this one, is actually really good for foreshadowing. Of the how they do it and fact that the board is like, they they don't think there's zero pessimism with a pencil.

372
00:31:04,177 --> 00:31:20,020
Yes. We're doing it. They can seem like oh. Yeah we can do that again, like nope we got this down. We are master trailers Al this. Yeah. There there are a lot of good callbacks in this one. Right? Because they they call back the joke about staying at Grandma's house a couple of times.

373
00:31:21,217 --> 00:31:34,360
That they that Barks goes back to, you know, he sets up daisy, and then he refers to it again. It's it's good rules of comedy. Huey, he's really following there. Alright. So in the morning, Donald is forced into

374
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:35,559
the colosseum

375
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:38,276
where the crowd gonna watch him beat

376
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:44,903
But of course, the the tires w out and they're just too over fed to even give them a second while.

377
00:31:45,663 --> 00:31:47,801
And everyone is just disgusted

378
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:51,166
with their terrible terrible mah raja.

379
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:56,188
They're so disgusted that the money men ask what it's gonna take to

380
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,279
just get him out of the country.

381
00:31:58,658 --> 00:32:02,594
And Donald, you know, initially doesn't ask enough, buddy ultimately

382
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:06,050
first class Huey, tickets for Kiwi doing lily.

383
00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:11,105
And on their voyage back home, they agree that they are all even.

384
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:12,485
And that

385
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,905
is Mar raja Donald.

386
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:16,657
Alright. So

387
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:21,402
we're gonna talk about how we felt about this one. Separately.

388
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:27,682
I'm gonna ask you guys to give your opinion, but I do wanna talk first about kind of the general consensus.

389
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:31,777
As always, we like to check the Inducks

390
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:33,076
website that

391
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:38,290
tracks user reviews for all Disney comic stories. So it gives a good aggregate

392
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:38,950
idea.

393
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,210
And

394
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,985
this one, you might be surprised

395
00:32:43,365 --> 00:32:45,543
for you... Or you might not. I don't know.

396
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:57,090
This one is rated very very highly. This is a very well regarded story of Barks it has a seven point seven out of ten on the end index page.

397
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:06,700
Which puts it right now at one hundred and sixty four. Out of the almost forty one thousand Disney comic stories that are rated.

398
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:11,050
Good enough for the top ninety nine point six

399
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:12,049
percentile

400
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:17,543
of all stories And I think we're eight episodes in now.

401
00:33:18,422 --> 00:33:19,895
And so we've got

402
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:24,659
Yeah. This is our ninth story because of course, last one was a two for.

403
00:33:25,376 --> 00:33:32,929
And so this is actually the second best regard it. Out of all the stories that we've done by kind of the general fandom.

404
00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:52,381
The only one that's higher and it's just by a very small fraction would be tear of the river. Is still our our best regarded story that we've we've done. So I I found it really interesting that this one is so highly regarded because this one's not really one of my favorites.

405
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:56,695
But, I guess, I guess it does fall into some of the classic,

406
00:33:57,355 --> 00:34:02,350
you know, things that people do love about Carl Barks stories, which is some of those

407
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:03,430
adventures

408
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,750
in really far flung places.

409
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:14,585
Some of that kinda happens stands where the the dot or kinda fish out of water and become embroiled and something bigger.

410
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:16,205
I personally,

411
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:18,045
I do love

412
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,619
the trading sequences

413
00:34:19,998 --> 00:34:24,054
that book that book and this story. I thought they were great

414
00:34:24,473 --> 00:34:39,644
I remember just loving it as a kid coming back that part. On the hold though, I don't really like how cool Donald is to the nephews using this one. And like, most of the peripheral characters and the story are also really un

415
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:46,651
I mean, it's it's very za and it's it's a very weird and intriguing like plot device.

416
00:34:46,989 --> 00:35:00,334
So it's definitely interesting, but I remember finding this very off putting as a kid. You know, this was in the collection that I had. I they hard down collection. I think this was the one out of the ten or so stories that I ran the least.

417
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:09,315
I do still find this one a bit off putting as an adult And I also have a hard time getting past some of the kind of orient

418
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:15,480
trapping of it. Although I do think it doesn't... It... It's not as bad as somewhere.

419
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:18,952
Of that time in regards to how it it treats

420
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:23,165
South Asia. So that that's my thoughts on this one.

421
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:31,991
Eric, how about you? What did you think? Of this story? Well, I mean, what you talking about how the depiction... Yeah. That's certainly is

422
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:41,495
you know? I haven't haven't received the eye raising, but you kinda sure i'm like, yeah, that was at the time. It wasn't Al lot understanding of other cultures and we make up a lot of stuff who played what need come on.

423
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:43,128
But

424
00:35:43,546 --> 00:35:45,842
still, you know, that's still being ridiculous

425
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,918
as comment should be

426
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:58,663
but I I as I read through it, I like I can see have a donald of the and the aspect of it. I did like coming to terms at the end, would you remembered, Huey,, get my nephews

427
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:14,235
these things and in me and having him say hey guys save me like, we're on it. We'll do work... You know, we we we we fight figure but we're family and we're gonna save you. And I thought I thought it was well written just like you're saying earlier just the whole beginning the end. The reoccurring jokes

428
00:36:14,616 --> 00:36:17,291
still trying to hit wrap my head around the hard legally

429
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,491
needed to make a mortgage of cable by diamonds or Kaiser land,

430
00:36:21,911 --> 00:36:24,305
which I don't think Tigers.

431
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:31,329
I'm not my understanding tag they need a lot more land than that to roam. But if it fits the historic it's the story. So

432
00:36:31,787 --> 00:36:37,380
Yeah. I I like it. I I... It didn't have a lot of the jumps of logic of

433
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:38,901
say the

434
00:36:39,415 --> 00:36:53,979
Scrooge, little go people that live a bit swamp and make you forget. I mean, which are very entertaining, but this isn't like the classic, you know, fish out of water, you know, that out of country story and after way be back home. Right on. So so were you

435
00:36:54,517 --> 00:37:04,016
surprised that this one is as well regard as it is? No. I'm I'm I'm not surprised. I I can see... I certainly see where people would like it and how it how it works out.

436
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:19,678
With the writing and portrayal is... They pretty much stick to there Ducktales in in some fashion of donald getting screwed and the nephew you saving right on. How about you, Ryan? What what were your opinions of this one? There were aspects of it. I liked.

437
00:37:20,214 --> 00:37:22,548
None of them had anything to do with the

438
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,280
a time in in the other country. So, yeah, I guess just like kind of the nephews

439
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:35,754
clever and just kind of the way they're handle all the different situations. I thought was really appealing Severino donald be awful to them as their only caregiver.

440
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:37,320
Thought was pretty

441
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,280
disheartening.

442
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:53,948
And then... But but most of all, like, the this society, I guess we'll call them an Inducks society because that's what we're going for here. They're so... They're so bizarre. Like it... It didn't have to be indians. And it I think it would've have made more sense if it was not if it was like martian

443
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,313
or or, like, some kind of weird magical

444
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:01,422
society from Travels or whatever that doesn't follow any logical

445
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:04,195
rules are in there in their cultural

446
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:08,136
makeup up there because because these guys are so weird.

447
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:23,636
It's so so weird. And like, at the end, at the end when they're like, what would it take to get you to leave the country? I was like, well what what he wanted to leave earlier while I just let him leave earlier, you took him place, and then you're going to execute him for not being every enough.

448
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,923
Just a innocent guy, but some other guys sent over there.

449
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,819
Like, what think

450
00:38:29,237 --> 00:38:48,022
execution was like their consolation price. Right? Like, we know he's gonna fail us, at least we can have this entertainment or watching and get eaten. But i but I agree. It's not really recognizable human being. I mean, it's not even like... Like, he had committed a crime or something. Like he was just a guy. He was just some guy.

451
00:38:48,638 --> 00:38:49,456
Like be

452
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,586
into it. It's too like. Let's kill him.

453
00:38:52,423 --> 00:39:00,711
Like and like, why did it why... So like the tigers. I'm picturing, like, the tigers are the Supreme Court and they they are the ones who decide if he lives or dies,

454
00:39:01,645 --> 00:39:10,813
if Tiger so, like know, this guy is fine this guy gets to live, and they go, okay. We'll we'll we'll buy you some first class. Tickets it's back home and and so does he retain a title?

455
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:16,476
I mean, he's still like easy to post? Is he... Can you build himself and resume me at the corner my will okay?

456
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:20,144
Yeah that's that's a good point. He

457
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:23,061
I I get the feeling that the others all

458
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,337
because they were eaten by Tiger. So maybe he is the

459
00:39:26,676 --> 00:39:27,236
and exile.

460
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:33,930
And if they just wanted to kill them, they other ways to kill him. You know, I mean, they could just get a guy with Al black hood and a big x.

461
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:40,041
These guys these guys have a stadium just for this though. They... That's sure. That's

462
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,296
they don't have an execution of stadium They a tiger stadium.

463
00:39:43,735 --> 00:39:43,815
Right.

464
00:39:45,305 --> 00:39:48,515
Well, anyway, i I I get your points.

465
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:58,355
It sounds like you... Go ahead. And more thoughts like kids have the Raja for more than a day. Like, why not send someone over a week before the way in and he could like...

466
00:39:58,775 --> 00:40:19,270
Even if he's gonna die, he could like, eat some nice meals, and we can make it go. Yeah. He can make a go of it and have some, you know, a good a good last one there or whatever have some kind of attempts instead of being like, we're gonna send someone over who obviously doesn't meet the terms. You have, you know, i when I this as the as the mirage of of

467
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,170
Ducktales

468
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:27,205
lawyer this and and, you know, making sure that he's showing up without enough time. Gotcha and.

469
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:31,265
Let's not just cut the fact that the macho of hoop do.

470
00:40:32,225 --> 00:40:34,125
Didn't have somebody in mind

471
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,917
until he saw him on the boat.

472
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:43,471
That's true. I mean, that's kinda happens every year. So you would think he'd have a backup somebody.

473
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:46,422
Is there no service that you that

474
00:40:47,121 --> 00:40:47,781
gonna like

475
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,478
no type this for me. You know.

476
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:54,108
He's probably gonna be one of them. So it's just the interesting

477
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:56,186
product. But anyway, this just

478
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:57,624
that.

479
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:04,235
That guy is the the ruler of his country. Right? He that he's the way who holds the mortgage, and he is personally

480
00:41:04,735 --> 00:41:09,455
going out on a boat from Burbank to find the latest guy he can find for that boat.

481
00:41:11,745 --> 00:41:13,203
To sucker into this deal.

482
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:19,564
And then when, you know, when they when they're sailing on there across the river there, he is per manning the house her.

483
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:21,042
It's.

484
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:23,219
Very hands on my raja.

485
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:39,501
Or sure. Yeah. And you know, I guess when you got skiing, you don't wanna you don't wanna trust it to be mop and rock steady. You know? You wanna take take care of it yourself so it doesn't get screwed up. It's kaiser of in it's tiger man you gotta make sure you close the deal. Yeah. Right.

486
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:45,196
Alright. So we've we've talked about the story. We've we've given our reflections

487
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:49,405
Let's see. Not not really a lot of appearances,

488
00:41:49,944 --> 00:41:57,195
you know, their media as popular as this one is Sparks never did that I'm aware of, never didn't oil painting based on this one.

489
00:41:57,995 --> 00:42:07,216
I'm not aware of any aspect of this story being referenced and then future stories, although someone could enlighten me. I didn't really find a lot

490
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:16,011
educational about this one kinda like we were getting at. The the whole cons truck of the idea of India is very fancy.

491
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:25,573
I wouldn't be surprised if Barks didn't use some nash and geographic reference for some of the buildings. But beyond that, I don't think it really reflects

492
00:42:26,272 --> 00:42:26,772
anything

493
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:31,890
accurate here. About India. Favorite panels, this is always a fun feature.

494
00:42:32,825 --> 00:42:35,250
I had a number of panels I liked

495
00:42:35,669 --> 00:42:44,335
There were also... This was one though where I noticed there were a lot of panels that had kinda unfinished art right or blank backgrounds in this one. So

496
00:42:44,953 --> 00:42:52,352
I feel like he... I don't know. Maybe it was pressed for time on this one. But at anyway, I did really like the...

497
00:42:52,848 --> 00:42:53,668
One I mentioned

498
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,400
where the Nephew is getting pulled out of the fruit basket

499
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,280
There's a really cool panel

500
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,600
on the steam.

501
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,120
Just

502
00:43:03,595 --> 00:43:10,150
has it sailing over where Donald is saying India. Here I come. I thought that was a really nice looking panel

503
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:24,795
I was also very taken by the the gem room when he's showing off his piles of diamonds. And it struck me that, you know, this is kinda one of the times that Barks is tipping is hat to being very interested in characters that a mass,

504
00:43:25,132 --> 00:43:26,926
huge amounts of wealth. Right?

505
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,540
They introduce uncle Scrooge,

506
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,580
not too far down the road.

507
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:38,655
And I did really like the panel that we're we're host, I think, really like where the Mah mirage Palace

508
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:47,513
is revealed for the first time. But I think my favorite one is when the tiger is launching at the scared elephant,

509
00:43:48,151 --> 00:43:52,373
after they cross the river. I I like the perspective on that one.

510
00:43:53,032 --> 00:43:59,859
I like it as a cool action shot. How about you guys any any panels really stand out? As a favorite.

511
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,099
I like that one the both. Be title where the

512
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:05,880
S going across and India ga town.

513
00:44:06,454 --> 00:44:15,407
That should be a bigger shot. But then I I also like the one right next to it, which is dial thing I'll go my state room just for dinner. You see in the background

514
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:23,605
Al lady standing of the railing, and it looks like you can tell that the wind window blowing so that got movement going on, in the background Inducks

515
00:44:24,305 --> 00:44:27,145
maybe the the the yellow hair yellow background.

516
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,925
But it was just nice background scenery

517
00:44:30,385 --> 00:44:30,885
on

518
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,420
the boat right? And the same one went these

519
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,220
leaving

520
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,420
before the vote when he's meeting

521
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,840
saying goodbye the burbank, essentially.

522
00:44:39,494 --> 00:44:47,755
Leaving home behind and it's just the distance shore and he's the so silhouette has perspective. I would love to Severino from these panels on a larger scale.

523
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:51,877
A little more finished, like you're saying we've been really good. That being said,

524
00:44:52,595 --> 00:44:53,613
the image of the

525
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:54,868
just makes me laugh.

526
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:01,915
How you're drawing big Valley tongue out blowing and like, no. No.

527
00:45:02,355 --> 00:45:04,890
I'm good. I'm gonna find a funny spot lay down. Yeah.

528
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:09,710
That if you can't... Then that's some pretty good comedy those

529
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:11,969
very fat happy tigers.

530
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:17,871
And and Donald, the one next to it. But both of the ones that show the tigers, the well fed tires

531
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:23,039
are are pretty fantastic. Panel with Donald just sweating profusely.

532
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:31,374
How about you right any any panels on phone? Fur and is the India here at come panel. I Feel like it's kind of reminiscent of,

533
00:45:31,754 --> 00:45:34,029
like, the Japanese flag and maybe. You get that kind

534
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:36,629
really nice blue on the ocean,

535
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:43,204
and then and then a really dark orange sun with yellow rays coming out at different angle there,

536
00:45:43,861 --> 00:45:44,499
which is very pretty.

537
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:46,595
One that kinda made me chuckle

538
00:45:46,972 --> 00:45:48,909
as I read it was when the...

539
00:45:49,366 --> 00:45:52,799
I don't it's a Oh, he's the the ticket taker guide, the push

540
00:45:53,139 --> 00:46:06,165
is in their room. And when he discovers the nephews and says still is, I get it. Then he says, so that's the setup. And he... He points his Jack finger right in Dialed Barks space and done back because leaning way back, and he's got the finger right on his beak.

541
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:10,359
And it's it's just a really great pose, but

542
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:15,290
I thought that was well. Yeah. You're yeah absolutely right. That one's hilarious.

543
00:46:15,627 --> 00:46:24,996
Very nice. We've got the obligatory sweat bead shooting out the side of his head. It it's being accused to bring me off so. Oh, and then I did forget

544
00:46:25,454 --> 00:46:25,954
to

545
00:46:26,413 --> 00:46:29,348
do... But then in the reflections part, I forgot to

546
00:46:29,726 --> 00:46:33,154
talk about things that might be dated or archaic versus

547
00:46:33,574 --> 00:46:34,074
retro.

548
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:42,244
The what stood out to me is dated was it was fun to see some of the old stuff that they traded up, like the very old style camera.

549
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:48,912
And then the idea of a young kid having a pocket knife to trade I know that you... Youtube too, both probably

550
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:51,084
were kids who had pocket knives

551
00:46:51,622 --> 00:46:52,122
But

552
00:46:53,576 --> 00:46:56,486
not not a ton of them that age would today.

553
00:46:57,124 --> 00:47:15,434
And then just the idea of taking a steam to India. Course is very very archaic. As far as things that didn't help don't hold up well, you know, we we already went into this. Obviously, the depiction of India I mean, it's kind of a fine line. Right? Like, it's not great. It's not awesome.

554
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:18,666
But on the other hand, at least, he didn't

555
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:21,743
try to use a kara chart accent

556
00:47:22,601 --> 00:47:24,154
mh. With the character

557
00:47:24,694 --> 00:47:28,994
that is true. He did show... He did show most of them wearing turban

558
00:47:29,454 --> 00:47:36,159
and, you know, that that's a common trope, but but those are my understanding is that those are only weren't I seek people.

559
00:47:36,736 --> 00:47:38,871
And then, you know, we had some of Al very orient

560
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:42,794
tropes like heron and and feeding people with providers.

561
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:44,114
But

562
00:47:44,454 --> 00:47:48,474
but again, on the whole, I I've I've seen worse depictions.

563
00:47:49,014 --> 00:47:52,922
I think that we have pretty much covered

564
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,878
My raja Donald.

565
00:47:55,336 --> 00:47:57,771
This one was... I do have a question, Mark. Yeah.

566
00:47:58,744 --> 00:47:59,143
Absolutely.

567
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,360
They never got the gold off of donald. Hey

568
00:48:03,018 --> 00:48:06,569
One of the greatest smuggling guys I've ever seen is

569
00:48:07,307 --> 00:48:09,205
good got can go

570
00:48:09,545 --> 00:48:11,283
and glue and

571
00:48:11,702 --> 00:48:15,788
then get her run around. So I just I mean, I don't know if that sounds gonna pay rent.

572
00:48:16,466 --> 00:48:23,706
Okay. For what? But they never... I never say how much, but it has a very amount. They never got the that's off ones

573
00:48:24,019 --> 00:48:32,932
run around with it. Yeah. I mean, it's it's tough glue, but still that was that with more of my takeaways at just thousand yeah so came out with from a gold lining kilo.

574
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:35,149
Oh man.

575
00:48:36,007 --> 00:48:37,406
You had to go there.

576
00:48:39,098 --> 00:48:44,665
That may be why they look so content lounging on those deck chairs on the way back. Excellent.

577
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:46,479
Thank you for pointing that out.

578
00:48:47,252 --> 00:48:53,970
Alright. So any other final thoughts before we wrap this one up, No. Not all I got Awesome.

579
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:54,387
