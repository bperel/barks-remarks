1
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,495
We can have

2
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:37,825
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer an artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comments of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological

3
00:00:38,163 --> 00:01:01,171
publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever, a Grown man who enjoys Inducks comics and I am joined by a ira returning guest host, Y Kim Gun. Can you

4
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:09,054
introduce yourself and tell us about your connection to these clinics? Thank you. Sure. I'm also grown man.

5
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:18,602
Heart. Ja fan, call Barks spam is Super pants. So it's a pleasure being on your shelf. Speaking about this story or just

6
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:24,838
Barks in general, I think it very too much Barks because it ends heavily influenced by his stuff. When I wrote,

7
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:28,324
which I do have some an coming called.

8
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:40,776
We've made some a few adventure doors that speaking about this particular story, what we're gonna talk about today. Yeah. Why don't you go ahead and and tell us what what are we covering today You're looking? Yes.

9
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:46,435
We are covering a one classic call Barks story from the early fifties

10
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,840
called the horse Flat story or at least that's one of the titles.

11
00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:59,366
Because I think that Barks didn't title this originally, or least it wasn't printed in the calling. So he had to make up some titles

12
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,500
and when he was asked by the fans,

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,794
do you remember any of those titles? Yeah. I I really like one of the alternate. Titles.

14
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:16,200
I think trouble from long ago that is my favorite. I know there there was at least one other. That was in some correspondence.

15
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,200
I I can't remember that one.

16
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,520
Okay. Well, this story...

17
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:28,769
I mean, I read most of the Barks stores as I very young kid. Because my my father was a doctor van. When he was a kid, he started collecting

18
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:50,667
buying this comments in Sweden back in nineteen fifty six. A few issues ran week, but in nineteen fifty seven, he began to buy them all and he continued to do so until he was around nineteen twenty back in nineteen sixty nine. Mh. And my grandparents... I mean, when he will away from home, he left all these comments with my grand. So I was a kid,

19
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:58,218
loved with visiting and because they had stacks and stacks old comics on the golden age and the course.

20
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:03,835
Treasure trove. Sure. And I wasn't even know allowed to look Al them mall because

21
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,588
they handed me a few and said, oh, well, we have more I wanna say more. Well, next birthday,

22
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:11,866
next Christmas

23
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,384
so... Yeah, a lot

24
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:36,382
visiting them. However, this particular storage. The horse raja story was published in Sweden. Back in... I think it was nineteen fifty six Yeah, ninety two five, you said, that's a year before my father started buying economics. And the first reprint was published in nineteen seventy. The year after My august stop clayton cox.

25
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:53,464
And the next was in nineteen eighty six when I was round loud So I don't believe I had really disappeared. And therefore, I don't have this strong emotional connection for this story as I do have with most of Barks other stories. So I'm looking at this though in kind of different

26
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:54,200
perspective.

27
00:03:56,252 --> 00:04:04,478
Important. What about you? Yeah. You know, I I have pretty much the same story as you to be honest. Like, like you, I had these...

28
00:04:04,817 --> 00:04:45,350
I collected. I I think I probably collected kind on the same time frame as your dad where I started getting them. Maybe a little bit younger. I was about seven, I think. And once I figured out Carl Barks, no I grabbed everything I could. Once a reprint, once the story was nearly reprinted, I would I would get that. Once I got all of the contemporary ones, I started to, like, look through the back issue bins, and this one just for whatever reason, it escaped me for a very long time. And so it was like pretty late. I think I was into my teens, but I knew enough about Barks to know that it was a pretty famous

29
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:52,189
Bark story, and I I finally managed to get a hold of, like, the very first American

30
00:04:52,607 --> 00:05:24,402
reprint of it. Which was the gold key. Yeah. You're looking at the same one there except as you've got the Wit like icon there. It might be that... This might have been the first time read. Yeah. Oh, yours is a forty center minus the twenty cents. So that's the next... I think that's the third time around. Okay. But but regardless, like, I want a long time knowing about this story and being really, really curious about it. And so it wasn't one of the stories that I read like a hundred times

31
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:29,963
as a child. And and I've gotta say when I finally got to it. I

32
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:35,360
enjoyed it, but it... I didn't I didn't love it. The way I did some of the, like,

33
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:47,882
reprinted over and over from that era like only a plural man and back to the cl day again and and so on and so forth. Exactly. But I used read that for the middleton done, the great

34
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:50,951
incoming artist we work regardless and some

35
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:52,585
now

36
00:05:52,962 --> 00:06:10,320
not in the Us. Is said on Facebook that if I want to pick the best Barks store ever, it would be this one. So it's got some big name fans. It it does and and it shows up really high on Inducks. Right? It's consistently like in the top twenties.

37
00:06:10,814 --> 00:06:16,043
When fans vote for this one. So I've gotta ask myself like, what am I missing? Yeah.

38
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,579
And and I'll be clear.

39
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:39,119
Right. I don't dislike the story. I I really enjoy it. I just... I... It just doesn't have that same punch for me. So it's interesting that both of us kinda feel the same way that that'll be something that we can keep in mind as we go through the the story itself. Yeah. Why don't we take a moment? I I I gather that you,

40
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:42,033
you got to be part of the editorial team

41
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:54,062
in Sweden when this was reprinted one of the last times around. Right? Yes. In Swedish Kara and extra, which means donald doc extra in nine in two thousand eighteen.

42
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:08,011
We tried to reprint doris in every issue of this common book we... Are our reprint Al long call store as the main feature. And for this issue number six two thousand eighteen, it was time for ga

43
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:11,679
Opposite else as it's in Sweden. And

44
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:16,239
together with this editorial team, I wrote piece about it. And...

45
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:21,319
Yeah. It's kinda feel a little bit daunting being kind of in charge of

46
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:24,934
introducing these Barks stories to, like, contemporary.

47
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,446
Yes. And nowadays on

48
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:40,795
the main of this comic back in two thousand eighteen, I was just a part of team. Now I oversee every page of this comic book and I try to make every special effect or or the

49
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:41,674
perfect

50
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:42,791
giving

51
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:44,724
my teammates

52
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:47,724
sometimes I must think a little bit demanding.

53
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:49,524
Yes. Detail oriented.

54
00:07:50,104 --> 00:08:01,770
Exactly. If something was wrong with previous printing, wanted to correct it. I this this painting will be the perfect printing. That's always what I I imagine that every time an a company

55
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:03,184
a publisher,

56
00:08:03,964 --> 00:08:09,080
reprint it. They're probably thinking to that to themselves, right? Where this is the

57
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:11,893
Severino or the thirteenth printing.

58
00:08:12,332 --> 00:08:20,327
Of this story. You know, they've gotta make a decision. Am I just gonna put it out there? Or am I gonna put it out there with some kind of life?

59
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:37,446
Commentary, am I gonna really focus on on making sure the coloring and the lettering is perfect. Am I gonna try and make the definitive version? And everyone has a little bit of a different idea what that definitive version is. Right? Exactly because the this version

60
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:39,119
has got some coloring

61
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:42,147
will lots and loss of ingredients

62
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:46,472
and I will show you since I see on screen here, you the listeners

63
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,025
to nigel this, but it's an water sequence

64
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,794
where the caller still come bonkers

65
00:08:53,095 --> 00:08:54,274
with using

66
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:55,114
ingredients

67
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:56,914
every panel

68
00:08:57,574 --> 00:09:00,074
everywhere. And and that would be computer

69
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:12,937
assisted. Right? Yes. I mean, some people love this. I don't. So it's Al also a matter of thinking what is the best version in which way which way showcase

70
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:18,126
Barks vision of this way the best way I think that too many ingredients

71
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,457
takes away

72
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:26,634
from Bark art and the storytelling because they can take over and you become conscious about the coloring

73
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:39,652
instead of reading the story. Yeah. I do refer some more so Barks. Yeah... That's totally right. Like, I go back and forth. Right? Because I love the coloring on, like the Carl Barks library

74
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:43,980
in the nineties, and I know that that was computer assisted.

75
00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:59,317
But but to my eye, what they did is they tried to, like, computer assist, but to help what the human hand and the human eye could do not to substitute. So I I don't know. It's it's one of those things where I I can't

76
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:02,271
describe what I like about it, but I know

77
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:18,403
that I like it, and I think that like, Susan Dave elite who oversaw that. I believe I think she did a stunning job on it, but I know it's not to everyone's taste. Yeah. I love her early stuff. But then I think that there were too many greetings. So sure. I like some of our stuff

78
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:22,654
just like some of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's talk about

79
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:25,355
some of the background of the actual story.

80
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:26,235
The

81
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,774
The first

82
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:32,066
The first publication in in the states was in four color

83
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:34,783
four hundred and ninety five. And

84
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,320
that was in July of nineteen fifty.

85
00:10:37,774 --> 00:10:41,746
Three. Yes. And this one's a little bit shorter

86
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:44,101
than kind of its contemporary.

87
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,446
Right? Most of the most of the stories that were in early uncle Scrooge,

88
00:10:50,085 --> 00:11:01,887
But and I I guess, I I neglected to mention, it is the four color but it's all currently called uncle Scrooge number three because, you know, when they when they went and gave uncle Scrooge, his own

89
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:10,654
monthly title or or bim monthly or whatever. When you gave him his own title, they started the numbering at number four. So officially, this is

90
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:18,187
This is both an uncle Scrooge and a four color. And and it has a companion story, a ten pager

91
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:41,643
Is it the round money bin? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's got, it's got a companion story because it's it's on the short side as far as the adventure stories. And I I do wonder if that is some of, you know, what affects kind of my my perception of the story. This one has not been reprinted in the states as often as again, some of its

92
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:59,255
And, like, for a a long part of my childhood and teenage years, it it didn't show up on the reprint schedule for a while. So it is a little bit harder to find. Exactly I see. All the ten times in the Us. But I can tell you that back in two thousand eighteen.

93
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:00,775
We had Al seen

94
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:01,975
six

95
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:10,265
publications of this way. So that it was time to rethink again. Right? The time was right. Yeah. Let's see. What else.

96
00:12:10,723 --> 00:12:19,509
I I do find it interesting to think about the title Right? This is one of the few titles where the, like, official fan

97
00:12:19,888 --> 00:12:24,960
designation feels like a placeholder holder. Right? Oh, it's It's the one with horse.

98
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:36,361
It's the horse rad story. Yeah. And let's see. I I know that this was the first story, I believe that his his new wife at the time

99
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,235
participated in

100
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,838
doing some of the lettering in Exactly.

101
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:47,385
You can see on at least a few of the pages. I don't remember exactly which ones.

102
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:53,115
But I have listed that she did most of the lettering on pages one through fourteen,

103
00:12:53,815 --> 00:13:01,956
and heated did most of fifteen through twenty two. Yeah. Through the book you you... You're problem. Right? Yes. I'm not I'm not. Sure.

104
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:03,925
Her doing is

105
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:14,367
rounder smoother. Yeah. And as should say that I suspect that she did more than just selected this story because when I examine it, I think that...

106
00:13:14,865 --> 00:13:23,959
She's a magazine, the villa in the story. A few of most of these panels are kind of not up to par with the regular bar sinking But

107
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:38,052
we can talk more about that when we get to those panels. Yeah, that's an interesting thought. I know I've seen some speculation that she might have done, you know, on pitched in on some stories. He's have such a prolific output. Yeah.

108
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:43,267
That the other weird thing is, like horse rad has kind of a stylist.

109
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:47,520
It stands out a little bit right, but it's kinda old fashioned

110
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,640
hyphen

111
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,020
in the middle, which you don't usually see.

112
00:13:51,660 --> 00:14:00,855
You don't have that. We we usually should write that word. Right. Okay. I didn't know. Yeah. To me when I read it with that it's very distracting to see that hyphen

113
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:07,615
just... That but there's a few words like that, like, in the early Barks Stories, I see

114
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:08,471
kidnapped.

115
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:11,722
Spelled where it looks like it's spelled kid.

116
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:22,370
And and it just I mentally stumble over it while reading. But has... Can you tell me Your kim has horse ref been like read inked

117
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,050
the the text redone because every

118
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:36,438
every writing of it looks like someone has rewritten it to me. Yes. In the beginning of the story, you can tell that both words or and reddish

119
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:48,025
are written by someone else. Yeah. But once you get into the story later on here, it's in some places, it's definitely Barks on and and writing. In one place, it's

120
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:51,937
just the word radius that's been re

121
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:54,708
replaced. I have no clue why

122
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:59,161
of the Barks wrote course various in the end of the store. Yeah.

123
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:12,455
It it's... It stands out, and I don't usually have, like a great eye for that kind of detail, but it even stood out to me. I... It made me wonder Did the story originally have something else

124
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:15,529
and someone decided that like horse

125
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:22,255
would fit better. Was there some other, like, really potent spice that he was supposed to be a hauling or something.

126
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:26,775
I I know that in France, the story is called

127
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:30,357
it refers to clothes in the French title.

128
00:15:30,835 --> 00:15:33,645
So that kinda made me wonder. Because there is one panel

129
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:43,490
where screws says, what's that source in the paper cup? And horse where is not Al source. Right? Right. Yeah. You're right. I would call it a condiment, like.

130
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:48,395
Yeah. That's not really accurate. So the maybe in mind

131
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:55,007
after a while, while joined the store and then had to went back and change it. Yeah. That... That's what I was thinking about.

132
00:15:55,365 --> 00:16:00,828
Alright. So we've had some good pro log here. Let's let's... I mentioned that French title,

133
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:06,780
We'll do... We'll name a couple of the titles from around the world, and then we'll get into the actual

134
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,375
story itself. I looked up I've got three this time. I've got Denmark first,

135
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:14,315
where

136
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:22,526
the Danish title and you can probably help me out because it's a it's a scandinavian language so you know better than I, but it's

137
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:24,563
More Beta

138
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:26,301
and Carmel Al.

139
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,020
Yeah.

140
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:30,686
How bad was that you came almost

141
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:31,901
That was pretty good.

142
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:33,597
Motel and.

143
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,765
Most good Al pronouncing and danish.

144
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:42,628
But this... That time is almost the same as the swedish one, which is

145
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:44,983
most of the gamma good.

146
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:59,400
That means must pay and old. Yeah. Same same thing in in Danish, apparently but it's, like have to pay Al old debt. Is the translation that that Google translate gave me. Yeah. So and I know that back in those days,

147
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:08,565
sometimes the Swedish comments or translate from the danish translation. Right. So that could be the case why we have some similar titles. And makes sense.

148
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,200
And then in in French,

149
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,900
I had mentioned the title is Al

150
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,760
year off.

151
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:24,788
Okay. And when I put that in to translate it, it... They're really short though. In a way I found suspicious it just said, and the clothes.

152
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:25,618
Okay.

153
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:27,115
So

154
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:40,840
maybe I'll put it out on on Facebook and and see, you know, if there's maybe a pun in that title or something. And then, boy, I'm really intrigued by the German title. The the German title is

155
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,400
Oh, how do you say thirteen

156
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:53,567
dr sig? That's l twelve tried same, brighton and Try. Right? Yeah. Right. Okay. So the the German title is Dry

157
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:54,684
Tweed.

158
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:55,801
Thirteen

159
00:17:56,338 --> 00:18:02,752
trillion. Okay. Do you know anything about that? Came? No. I have no clue why

160
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,143
called it. Yeah. Fascinating.

161
00:18:05,654 --> 00:18:09,940
Sorry folks. Someone... Someone will educate me after I drop the.

162
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:10,874
Sure.

163
00:18:11,512 --> 00:18:19,603
If anyone in germany here's this, police us know. That's right. Five percent of my listeners is German. So someone...

164
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:28,479
Yeah. And you know what, I looked up a little bit about her strategy and I learned a little bit interesting. Please tell me. I I found that apparently,

165
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:32,768
in addition to there being studies about horse,

166
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:35,325
having a nice bacterial antibacterial

167
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:37,803
component that can kill harmful

168
00:18:38,142 --> 00:18:39,641
bacteria and microbes

169
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:43,111
it apparently will drive some Inducks.

170
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:56,120
Away. Okay. Okay. So Barks, did is research photo the story. Yeah. One of those moments where he seems to have gotten something at least a little bit right. That might have been... The inspiration was start the story.

171
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:57,632
Goodwill be.

172
00:18:58,048 --> 00:18:59,664
Alright. So any any

173
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:04,087
other thoughts you've got before we go through the actual narrative

174
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:16,725
of the story. No... I think you can start with page one. Yep. Let's let's do this. We're we're gonna do what we usually do we're we're each gonna summarize the page and then just chime in with our observations.

175
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:20,585
And so I get to do this lead off page.

176
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,780
And

177
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,320
Barks is so good at his openers. He's so good as introductions.

178
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,155
We get this really great

179
00:19:30,494 --> 00:19:30,994
very

180
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:31,833
intriguing

181
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:33,152
splash panel

182
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:47,652
that is kind of the back too long ago. Right? It it is the it is our trouble from long ago. And and shows a ship rep. His narrator box tells us when it tells us where

183
00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:52,431
we learned that this ship, the Golden goose that was bound from Gladstone,

184
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:53,051
Scotland

185
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:54,526
to Jamaica,

186
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:59,670
sank without warning off the southern tip of Haiti. And Barks

187
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,190
just so so quickly, leads us into the the meat of the story itself.

188
00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:11,963
We get to meet a man who is introduced first in a a sinister

189
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,078
silhouette.

190
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,370
And he is bearing a court order

191
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:21,090
that ent him to every scent of uncle sp

192
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,930
fortune.

193
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:28,368
And Scrooge kinda takes in the document. He points out that it it

194
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:31,757
that all he gets to keep is an old suit of clothes

195
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,570
and it further

196
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,010
indicates

197
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:40,250
that he owes him any teeth in his possession if he has

198
00:20:41,564 --> 00:20:42,064
And

199
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:51,967
units, it's not until the very last panel of that first page that we get a good look at the man, who is the very memorable

200
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:53,086
Chi.

201
00:20:54,344 --> 00:21:03,741
As he says, he is the last heir of the clan makes sue. He just tells Scrooge to if you wanna know more keep reading. Yeah.

202
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:07,890
And and and and first was I didn't think about this

203
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:13,330
before you mentioned it about the cy silhouette because for me as an artist I was

204
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,370
distracted you by having two

205
00:21:16,164 --> 00:21:23,888
stacked upon its to us about each other, but but of course, it's it's a storytelling device that I don't think about. It's...

206
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:31,622
I I think it it... Sorry. It does... It does a great job of engaging the reader with who is this guy.

207
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:35,186
And you know, as I cover these in order,

208
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:42,306
I'm struck by the fact that this is the second of his stories that I've have read that opens with a big splash panel

209
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,880
with a mysterious

210
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,720
ship rep because in no such environment.

211
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,380
Yeah. Yeah.

212
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,420
Because because he does the same thing,

213
00:21:51,914 --> 00:22:02,897
in no such environment, and they're very reminiscent of each other, but but very different stories. Yeah. And and this first page. I have to say that, you know, when the store gets translated,

214
00:22:03,475 --> 00:22:04,175
we have

215
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:12,365
the mentioned that the Golden Goose was bathroom from from Gladstone to Jamaica. And sang to the warning of the southern Severino

216
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,505
of Haiti in Sweden

217
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:16,105
because Ga

218
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:18,638
to Gibraltar, and it was

219
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:24,140
it's sank in the English gel. Interesting. Yeah. Because, you know, Go

220
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:32,411
support, a big port in the Southern Sweden. Al little of the sweden. So it's... The probably try to make it make more sense

221
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:40,625
Right. For this smooth this audience. I will see that don't next page. But that it doesn't... It doesn't really mesh with the weather of the story.

222
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:42,420
No. No No.

223
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:47,255
I mean, I mean, if you try to make sense of the story, the settings

224
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:53,725
and the self seize like wrong here, the coral rates and everything, it doesn't make sense at all.

225
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:58,594
Right. Yeah. Kinda kinda reminiscent of what is it that this scandinavians

226
00:22:58,971 --> 00:23:06,506
like to localize luck of the north is as Donald Ducktales Greenland. Am I remembering that right? Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

227
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:15,422
Yeah. Well good I think this is a a pretty strong opener. Go ahead. But maybe maybe the punch would been stronger.

228
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:16,681
If Chi

229
00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:26,185
for shown on page two instead of at the end of page one. So you you have Al your peach Scrooge. You think one one more panel of ci silhouette maybe.

230
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:27,794
Maybe made.

231
00:23:28,552 --> 00:23:30,487
But on page two, we

232
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:33,795
continue with the Scrooge reading this

233
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:34,672
explanation.

234
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:41,389
That she's gives him. And we see that it's a flashback sort of to the four others

235
00:23:42,738 --> 00:23:45,248
where the sw of like shipments suit.

236
00:23:46,244 --> 00:23:56,118
Talks to kept C mac Ducktales, and make a deal. Where ci duct agrees to transport a case of horse values to jamaica, ownership,

237
00:23:56,477 --> 00:24:01,125
the Golden goose, and it has a steiner contract. And it doesn't have it's Gladstone.

238
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:01,864
Unfortunately,

239
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:11,054
Because of course, this could contains a fine print which says that you will essential to lose or all of this money if it doesn't delivered and stuff. But

240
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:16,335
stephen science the contract and the the ship syncs, of course,

241
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:20,041
all the sale or is gold teeth, and she's...

242
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:24,763
She's a poor father takes over house and everything. Too surprise.

243
00:24:25,538 --> 00:24:32,230
Yeah. So this is this this is an interesting flash. This is one of the few times where Barks kind of like

244
00:24:32,648 --> 00:24:34,004
dwell on Scrooge

245
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,894
past or rather, like his his lineage.

246
00:24:38,471 --> 00:24:39,768
Exactly. And the

247
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:44,174
and that Think is not a good storage panel.

248
00:24:44,554 --> 00:24:57,030
Not Barks is a fourth panel where ci pump signs the contract it reads as it it's spoken in a in a tactical play. Mh. Was a a misplaced my spec

249
00:24:57,384 --> 00:25:01,949
what does the smoke prints say? Oh well, never mind. It's kind of obvious

250
00:25:02,286 --> 00:25:09,775
where where this is going. Yeah. I I think that's a really good point. I I... As soon as you said that, I was like, yeah, that panel,

251
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,941
it's it's a cool visual of him sq.

252
00:25:13,434 --> 00:25:18,775
And it reminds me of, like, Scrooge sq later on in the money well. Yeah. But

253
00:25:19,195 --> 00:25:25,430
but it's a little bit on the nose, and it feels a little bit like it's kinda hitting you over the head with...

254
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:42,794
Because you get the explanation on the building's page anyway. Yeah. It's interesting too that, you know, Chi and ancestor sw. They look... They're they're essentially the same character design. Exactly. I'm also struck by how plastic Scrooge is while

255
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:53,427
while he's been kinda taking this in. Right? He's being very, like reserved. Barks has him just being very very stoic and very une emotional. Yeah.

256
00:25:54,279 --> 00:26:00,171
And what you think you came about this element with the false with the gold tea. Oh what about it?

257
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:08,404
It it stands out. It's... I I don't know. I feel like it's something that I I want it to work better.

258
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:15,200
Because it's such a... It it's it's almost iconic. Right? But then it it's weird.

259
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:23,634
It's every time I see those t time, just I'm creeped out by them. It's it's extremely weird because we never see the Ducktales tea,

260
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:36,181
Except this time with this golden and teeth, and it's looks weird. It does. Like, like so I'll go on to the next page where you see cfo foam kind of greeting is teeth

261
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,579
at that

262
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:41,389
at that contract and the fine print that says

263
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:52,111
exactly you said the small print pledges all your worldly possessions in the event you failed to deliver the horse strategy. And he's gritty those teeth, and I'm just so distracted

264
00:26:52,688 --> 00:26:53,007
by it.

265
00:26:54,004 --> 00:27:00,579
It maybe that seem was the reason why we used go teeth. Just gas to Al that

266
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:06,845
Maybe, I think Barks might might just have found the the very idea of someone

267
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:13,202
demanding your gold key. Yes. Just such Al dignity. I think he probably found it funny.

268
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:18,085
I guess, boy, you know, this is obviously, it's got a bit of a theme here. Right?

269
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:21,079
Contracts. This story is interested in

270
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:22,799
contracts and legal e's

271
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:32,754
much in the same way that he was focused in Golden helmet on on people using the legal system to, like, take advantage of each other.

272
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:38,642
Exactly he had not forgotten about those lawyers. And realize. Yeah. Yeah. He's not done.

273
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,071
If he doesn't, we don't have a shark key in this one. Right?

274
00:27:44,004 --> 00:27:50,811
Chi just has the the contract itself. So so that's what Barks must have been thinking about that

275
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:53,379
contract maybe as he signed those divorce tape.

276
00:27:54,157 --> 00:27:55,773
Yeah. And it says judgment,

277
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:58,643
big letters on the top of. Right.

278
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:05,042
So so we kind of flash forward back to the present. We we finished the flash

279
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:05,921
with

280
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,078
with cfo foam

281
00:28:08,977 --> 00:28:09,477
I

282
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,769
running away

283
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:11,889
from Mix.

284
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:19,960
And and then we flash back to Scrooge who who sums it up for us, basically because my ancestor

285
00:28:20,354 --> 00:28:21,452
wouldn't give your

286
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:33,009
a set of gold teeth. I have to give you everything I own. And we got chi sm they are saying that is the law. That's what our villains in the Barks stories like to hide behind.

287
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:36,142
Yeah. Yeah. And and Mick

288
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,814
tries to rush him out, but Scrooge has been very,

289
00:28:40,272 --> 00:28:50,440
He points out that he does have his glasses on. And so he can read the fine print. And he notices that he has thirty days to

290
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:51,876
fulfill the

291
00:28:52,253 --> 00:28:53,192
contracts original

292
00:28:53,823 --> 00:28:54,323
turn

293
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,072
and so we we just transitioned to him

294
00:28:57,847 --> 00:29:00,755
his nephews for thirty days of their help.

295
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:03,721
To Yeah. To their irritation or to donald.

296
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:15,804
Exactly. Any like to point out, if you look at power ex... Especially panel four four and five here, I would say that if you Al screwed... Okay. Here's tiny, but the

297
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:19,495
is not as good as in the rest of the panels.

298
00:29:19,949 --> 00:29:22,689
So it's think that that maybe is

299
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:30,980
wife gary had hand this throwing backgrounds. Because it we'll see later on in the story where there it... Our patterson

300
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,298
panels with only,

301
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,555
they're also a bit less good ink.

302
00:29:35,328 --> 00:30:10,730
And we should... And we should note that Ga was a very talented artist in her own Right. You know, she clearly didn't have, like the experience doing comic part that he did. But and he also did like hand off some of these duties occasionally his his previous wife as well. Right? Am I remembering that right? I don't know. But but I know that they're already dude. Yeah. Building the black to be lettering and did some backgrounds. So this was one of the first stories that you worked on. Yeah. Wanna be surprised if because said, oh, do just go ahead any the secondary characters

303
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:16,405
the backgrounds or whatever. Right. That and And in panel six, does that Scrooge.

304
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:23,635
I I kind of... He kind of looks like Christmas on Bear Mountain Scrooge to me. In that six panel.

305
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:32,382
Like, he looks a little bit more, like, like his original version. I don't know. Alright. Well, go. Where on next page,

306
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,655
here we find on unscrew

307
00:30:35,152 --> 00:30:35,652
describing

308
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:41,010
the mission to the kids and within... They thirty days to abuse those gold

309
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:45,437
t or else. But the problem is that the gold

310
00:30:45,774 --> 00:30:46,274
was

311
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,261
used by screws to star fortune and that's

312
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:51,790
why now owns

313
00:30:52,844 --> 00:30:53,344
everything.

314
00:30:54,118 --> 00:31:03,049
To she's so much soon. And that's why this is sold good to buy the prospect ultra. And this is, of course, something that Rosa and noticed that

315
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:10,475
he included c duct and everything and the gold teeth in the store. Right. And and I read that before I even read this.

316
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:34,379
Okay. But so the conclusion is that since no longer had, you know longer got the gold teeth, they gotta find the original case of horse reddish and bring it to jamaica but Al does points out, it's impossible because it's at the bottom of the ocean, but hey, that won't stop Inducks. Right. It's it's an incredibly long shot. Right? So

317
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,507
I've got some... We do have some really good steaks here, we have a very coherent

318
00:31:41,322 --> 00:31:42,797
outline of the plot.

319
00:31:43,355 --> 00:31:53,763
I do feel like that's a strong element of this story. And Barks, we are now poor paging into the story, you know, everything we need every four point. We now

320
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:58,890
how much is a stake. The entire on Scrooge. So, of course,

321
00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:05,578
we're not engaged in the story and we're ready to get board on the ship. Will take us on this pressure.

322
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:11,630
Right. And and we get our second element that deals with contracts here on this next page.

323
00:32:12,284 --> 00:32:13,263
Because the Nephews

324
00:32:13,802 --> 00:32:15,559
do something very wise.

325
00:32:16,318 --> 00:32:18,776
The decks don't usually do this. Usually,

326
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:22,422
Scrooge is able to kind of exploit them for

327
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:32,250
for chicken feed wages. Classically, it's thirty cents an hour. But in this situation, they say that that the the nephews have had

328
00:32:32,787 --> 00:32:37,769
trouble claiming wages. So they're gonna make sp sign a contract this time.

329
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:48,770
And and as he mu over the dignity of being made to sign this, he gloss over some fine print. Yeah. Exactly. I I really

330
00:32:49,188 --> 00:32:57,730
this makes me wonder what kind of fine frame the Barks encountered while dealing with this lawyers? And that might also been a

331
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:10,835
starting point for this story. Yeah. And do talking about fine frames. Because it this is the gimmick that runs through the entire store. Sure. Maybe there was some terms and his legal proceedings that he didn't become aware of.

332
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:12,570
Until later. Yeah.

333
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,389
But So

334
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:16,470
so the docs launch

335
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:22,715
and, you know, they they kind of they kinda mentioned that the only clue as to the

336
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:35,673
sinking of the Golden goose Al that it sank somewhere off the... Their side of haiti. And, you know, he's he's at least he Scrooge is very determined. He's got all the kinds of gear that he needs. To look.

337
00:33:36,272 --> 00:33:50,650
Sure. It's widget edition, it it's, of course next to the white Dover. Mh. Since we're at the in the English channel, and I even changed the clips in the background and ten five to white plates to click oh.

338
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,650
Well, that's that's quite the the background.

339
00:33:54,445 --> 00:33:59,745
Sure. On the next page, the find shape directory. We're we are Al on what's...

340
00:34:00,124 --> 00:34:03,620
It's on page Right? Right? Yeah. It's pretty early.

341
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:05,940
Yeah. Find an old Al.

342
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,020
And, of course, Scrooge

343
00:34:09,311 --> 00:34:10,409
brings out the

344
00:34:11,703 --> 00:34:13,200
drivers gear and

345
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:17,405
sinks into the ocean here and commenting two minutes later.

346
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:28,867
While sinking into the deep. Precious getting bad. And the bottom sight how deep is that correct and then donald says the rated the rate says that it's three thousand,

347
00:34:29,682 --> 00:34:34,527
you must be two it. And of course, that's three and four miles

348
00:34:36,036 --> 00:34:37,913
later on in the final plan on this page.

349
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:39,291
Explains

350
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:50,328
why Chase donald that it's about chinese land lovers learned that is have is an inch. It's six feet. And this joke is totally removing the swedish division.

351
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:53,699
Is

352
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,060
how much do you think of adam's

353
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,579
one? Well, that's too bad. I I really like this.

354
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:06,295
I really like this joke. It's one of my favorite parts in the story. That this is the kind of humor that I really like.

355
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:08,515
One character

356
00:35:08,855 --> 00:35:10,315
not knowing a technical

357
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:12,355
term and the other character

358
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:20,545
teaching them. I learned about a fathom from literally reading this story. I'm just comparing the old swedish

359
00:35:20,845 --> 00:35:26,885
translation. And and then the first one from the fifties, it says didn't it you see it was five hundred meters, which doesn't make sense?

360
00:35:28,498 --> 00:35:36,170
Apparently, Google tells me the deepest point in the Atlantic ocean is is twenty seven thousand and and a half feet.

361
00:35:36,664 --> 00:35:41,669
So this is pretty deep, but not but but it's a realistic depth. Yeah. Yeah. So

362
00:35:42,286 --> 00:35:46,429
okay. Be... These this part of the story that we're in, y

363
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:52,967
it and it's gonna kinda go along right? Like this for a little while. They're gonna be looking at various

364
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:54,580
ship ramps.

365
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:57,434
And Donald is gonna take his own turn.

366
00:35:57,954 --> 00:36:19,175
And just think about this is the part of the store was just just fun games. Because yeah we know that they are on thresholds homes No for some fun parts that will quite not the story because we will get more serious later on yeah It's just fun. That's a good point. It's kinda it's kinda like the site Severino part because we get to see some different ship Barks.

367
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,855
The ship x look really neat. They're from different eras

368
00:36:24,088 --> 00:36:31,390
We get... We get these different, like, Donald is kind of being a tourist locking at the different kinds of fish.

369
00:36:32,282 --> 00:36:34,792
And and those are some really neat panels.

370
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,266
Yeah. But Scrooge.

371
00:36:36,704 --> 00:36:55,781
Screws is yelling at him to keep him on track and And at some point, Donald comes across this little mysterious bit where he realizes not seeing any fish right here. Yeah. And, of course, Uncle Scrooge on next Page Al at him If you come to place where there's a ship called the Golden Goose, Wake,

372
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:02,890
long after to give me a boss. Well here. Because it's getting irritated. Why report, there's no fish while they they are an address on?

373
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:04,430
Of course

374
00:37:05,184 --> 00:37:10,086
very important later to arm. And and and then get a red herring speaking fish. Yeah.

375
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,140
Now

376
00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:37,544
seize. Finds an old Al and this side, this pressure has and we Al swedish we of course, within... Oh, he found it. If found the how horse strategy, this the nutrition and work. But he only finds times and rub and piece of eight and our surprise, why, I mean, Scrooge would be delighted to find this in any other case but when it's entire poaching the steak, this is just threat. So.

377
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,980
Yeah. We we see a which

378
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:42,299
jason and dolls

379
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:53,128
with this cane while the nephews are playing with the issues in the final panel this page. One of the very rare times where we'll see Scrooge very, like dis

380
00:37:53,665 --> 00:37:55,714
in a and a pretty big fortune. Yeah.

381
00:37:56,911 --> 00:37:59,224
It's it's about. It's. On the next page,

382
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:01,838
the today's passes. Right.

383
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:10,641
Yeah. And and this next page is really all about that passage of time. Right? Could we kinda have a clock ticking in the background?

384
00:38:11,195 --> 00:38:15,155
Like in in the back of our minds, we know that they don't have all the time in the world.

385
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:17,295
And Scrooge is becoming

386
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,295
for

387
00:38:18,635 --> 00:38:34,655
because his time is running out his chances are running out. So at some point, when the nephews hughes brings Al lunch to sc to cheer him up. And this is that part where you mentioned that Scrooge calls it a sauce instead of condiment. He he asks about the sauce.

388
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:36,266
In the paper cup,

389
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,920
and the nephew tells him it's worse rad,

390
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,180
which of course, triggers screws to be

391
00:38:42,840 --> 00:39:03,720
to fly into a range because horse rad is the cause of all his problems. It's it's very convenient Right? We've never heard any reference to horse rad that I know of in any other Barks comic but but the story demands this part, and he... He toss the dinner over in a rage and went on Q tell,

392
00:39:04,415 --> 00:39:06,595
about what donald notices.

393
00:39:07,175 --> 00:39:09,315
Yeah. He noticed that all of the officials

394
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:20,752
vanish. There's a ring of water around that spanish, not fish will swim. So... And that makes him think about the place he visited it a few days ago and they turn the ship back, Don

395
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:24,125
And now, he makes the hottest in under

396
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:29,180
history as a as a caption says here. If finds a gallon, under Coral ledge

397
00:39:29,798 --> 00:39:30,657
yeah. Because

398
00:39:31,074 --> 00:39:40,920
it and bugs must had some joined this signal because I it it's Ducktales and he wouldn't have done it if it hadn't enjoyed it. Right. But donna enters

399
00:39:41,456 --> 00:40:09,834
the record shared, he noticed that a dozen beams were sold almost in two So his conclusion, of course, that swim of mac was going to make sure that it horse reddish ever reached Jamaica. Yeah. And of course, in the ship, tahoe finds the host reddish. Yeah. Well, well sealed. Yeah. Very well sealed after two hundred years I find this This is pretty cool. Right? He goes out of his way to to make the ship wrapped pretty concealed.

400
00:40:10,312 --> 00:40:16,345
First off. And it's interesting that it's like kind of painted as solving the mystery

401
00:40:16,765 --> 00:40:19,825
The reader, of course knows that that both Mixed

402
00:40:20,365 --> 00:40:22,280
are are Devious

403
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,920
themes. So, you know, no one is gonna be surprised that there was sabotage,

404
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:34,562
but it's... We needed to see it confirmed. Second So the Inducks haul the horse rat up and they celebrate,

405
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:40,758
but Scrooge isn't quite ready to cheer too much because they they only have

406
00:40:41,136 --> 00:40:42,055
three days.

407
00:40:42,894 --> 00:40:44,912
Left of that original thirty days.

408
00:40:45,411 --> 00:40:45,845
And

409
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:52,525
he clarified that Jamaica still two days away if they have a fair wind but

410
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,937
they seem to have been be recalled

411
00:40:56,356 --> 00:41:01,630
because we have no wind at this point. Not too much action on this page.

412
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:12,718
But it does a good job of kind of getting us a little bit anxious, Like, I'd say... Yeah. Because it's a nice relevant to it, because on the previous pages we have had this

413
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,053
outrage from Scrooge,

414
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:15,192
the trash

415
00:41:15,649 --> 00:41:21,273
and know everything is called and still. That it's it a the column before the storm,

416
00:41:21,692 --> 00:41:24,630
which is which actually is in this space. Because

417
00:41:25,169 --> 00:41:31,837
on the next page, the in the morning, the wind has dried entirely, so now they cannot of get panicked

418
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,714
and Jewish is radio the

419
00:41:35,053 --> 00:41:39,004
port for Tug as a they can towed to Jamaica. But also,

420
00:41:39,342 --> 00:41:42,477
they see these dark clouds and there's a hurricane

421
00:41:42,895 --> 00:41:54,850
coming. So even if they found all the force reddish, they still have problems. Yeah. This is nicely set up. Right? The... I think I think Barks does a good job of of ratchet up tension here.

422
00:41:55,623 --> 00:41:56,123
We

423
00:41:56,501 --> 00:42:16,081
we can tell what's coming. It's it's that eerie column as you said, By the way, I totally gloss over. I need to comment how great Scrooge looks in his snappy, like, sailing ga. Right? We I I can't believe I forgot Right Donald is like perpetually wearing a sale outfit.

424
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,950
And Barks never does this with Scrooge, and he almost never dresses him. For the occasion

425
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:24,428
on these adventures,

426
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:52,082
I think sometimes when he's in cold weather, Barks will go out of his way to show him wearing cold weather gear. But but so the best of my knowledge, this is the only time he he does this. Could be. But as would said it's always nice to see some kind of other clothes. Yeah. And of course, here is Al it don't make sense with the doll having used sailor suit and the net you said there's small sailor hats and everything. Yeah. But but but it looks delightful.

427
00:42:52,818 --> 00:42:58,518
So we get this neat sequence where Scrooge is Scrooge is trying to

428
00:42:58,898 --> 00:43:05,490
convey over the radio. How urgent it is. Neo opens up his purse strings. He... He promises a million bucks.

429
00:43:06,185 --> 00:43:06,685
To

430
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:08,125
whoever

431
00:43:08,465 --> 00:43:08,965
can

432
00:43:09,345 --> 00:43:17,168
give them the toe that they so desperately need. We got a really cool panel of the shipping silo silhouette the calm

433
00:43:17,506 --> 00:43:22,632
ship, broadcasting its Sos, and we see we see it being received

434
00:43:23,144 --> 00:43:38,136
So we know that whoever is on the island is gonna gonna put it out there, you know, that they say that maybe someone will risk the storm to give you a tow. And then we basically see the the storm stripe. Now the these are some pretty

435
00:43:38,594 --> 00:43:39,772
great panels

436
00:43:40,565 --> 00:43:44,665
of water pouring on Scrooge looking very determined.

437
00:43:45,805 --> 00:43:47,105
Ton looks very,

438
00:43:47,485 --> 00:43:55,480
you know, he looks like he fits in and his sale or regard. Yeah. And and then the story making a good sixty knots.

439
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:55,860
Yeah.

440
00:43:57,075 --> 00:44:02,365
You can tell, you remember the golden helm story is been discussed His

441
00:44:02,942 --> 00:44:03,222
Barks

442
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:05,119
health

443
00:44:05,497 --> 00:44:05,896
press Al.

444
00:44:06,749 --> 00:44:10,199
And here we are again. I bet that that karl had

445
00:44:10,655 --> 00:44:16,631
his opus Al and sunny pages at hand and drawing this storm at sea sequence.

446
00:44:17,128 --> 00:44:20,777
You can tell that me enjoy doing this. Yeah. Big waves

447
00:44:21,234 --> 00:44:21,734
nice

448
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,060
and everything here. Right. At this page,

449
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,940
the follows the one you talked about two thirds are only

450
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,994
shots of the shape from a far. No closed stops, No deductible,

451
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,631
we see this storm so we can

452
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,747
understand how dangerous it is and ship is

453
00:44:40,406 --> 00:44:44,431
breaking apart and the fifth time is just one long big panel

454
00:44:44,887 --> 00:44:48,656
most black to the reader not understand of

455
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:57,665
this... Red and then cut to the and his companion. Sip rings or maybe doing things some eating some ice cream on a

456
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,540
Al a hotel in Havana.

457
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:05,220
So is a nice contrast Our heroes risk their lives, the villa,

458
00:45:06,672 --> 00:45:07,172
drinks.

459
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:15,268
Yeah. Exactly. And and you sense that Mix is, like, basically already spending. His fortune.

460
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:18,921
Exactly. Exactly. But I have a first boss hotel

461
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:29,205
best rooms, best room service drinks and everything. And then he gets the news. Yeah. But you think that O doc will never find the golden goose and the radio

462
00:45:29,705 --> 00:45:32,098
says flash Al unusual

463
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:43,785
comes from the H Hurricane area, and then on next page, it gets to hear the news the all that underscore offers a million dollars for Power boat to tow speed between Like.

464
00:45:44,345 --> 00:45:50,051
I like his response to the radio. You know, how he's outraged. She can't spend my money like that.

465
00:45:50,628 --> 00:45:56,490
But but then he his face like, he goes into shock because he realizes is what that means.

466
00:45:57,105 --> 00:46:04,895
And the radio kinda makes a joke about about screws mission to deliver a load of horse. Because because, of course, in English,

467
00:46:05,669 --> 00:46:07,528
Horse rad is like an idiom

468
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:09,526
for, like, Bs

469
00:46:10,065 --> 00:46:11,963
or or, you know, baloney.

470
00:46:12,342 --> 00:46:17,804
Someone someone being full of And and so so mix so is

471
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:39,245
is upset and he kinda goes into it ti. And and his his account there that we we only just get introduced to. His name is Joe. Right? He's just a tough. He kinda calms him down. And until cancels now gotta to find out where they are. And and we we kinda know what's coming, but then we flash back to the Ducktales

472
00:46:39,205 --> 00:46:42,451
really flounder in this terrible storm.

473
00:46:43,408 --> 00:46:44,865
And and when screws

474
00:46:45,482 --> 00:46:51,543
instruct dewey to keep radio, we get this neat echo the last time that he looked towards

475
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:56,550
that, you know, in that panel, it's it's a repeat. An echo go of that seen

476
00:46:57,129 --> 00:47:09,745
And dewey just tells him hey, I've got news for you. The radio washed board. Two hours ago. I really like the Nephews expression there. Exactly is so sarcastic. Yeah. Wonderful. This is a very

477
00:47:10,045 --> 00:47:21,515
sarcastic story overall. We don't often hear Scrooge himself that you had pointed out when he was radio to Donald while he was diving he was sarcastic. Yeah. But on the next page, and

478
00:47:22,015 --> 00:47:30,004
sort of mosquito pump in the first panel, say oh what click on you? How old phone to feel for helpless and we can see how

479
00:47:30,421 --> 00:47:35,183
is. The water is pouring in over the ship. The next panel, one is lena nephews

480
00:47:35,695 --> 00:47:45,239
can't we see one of the net use saying the the routers broken off. The compass shows the drifting straight sideways of her course and

481
00:47:45,935 --> 00:47:58,365
Scrooge just can't stand. So he gathers all the the Inducks trying to make this comfortable as possible to they go inside. This is a wonderful panel coming up next power six, such a yeah.

482
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,865
To the rest of the page was all chaos.

483
00:48:02,365 --> 00:48:06,017
Inside, it's Al quiet. And then it is comfy. Oh, very.

484
00:48:06,736 --> 00:48:12,031
And they up to their next almost with water. Right. It's it's a sort of

485
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:25,940
is it called common relief. Yes. Exactly Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Little moment and a light there. Exactly. And then paul boom bam, something happens outside what can be worse than a storm Al threatens their line. It's just Al

486
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:36,295
gun boat, pumping shelves and them from a from point blank range. So from a store to Gun thread, everything is going bad for the doctor.

487
00:48:37,075 --> 00:48:39,270
Yeah. I really like Donald react

488
00:48:39,968 --> 00:48:51,263
his expression there and I like the tension that it creates as as he sees it before the reader does. Exactly It's a well executed World planned time. Nothing necessary we only is

489
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:56,915
because everything seems so very any other panels you for this to the store.

490
00:48:57,329 --> 00:49:02,618
I don't think so. Yeah. You're right. It's it's not the storm that has him terrified.

491
00:49:03,116 --> 00:49:04,573
Exactly this no

492
00:49:05,071 --> 00:49:05,350
understand.

493
00:49:05,925 --> 00:49:20,260
Bad this new situation is. Right. And I really like this next sequence. I think this is one of the strongest sequences of the story we we kinda see Chi Mcs at his most villainous. And we don't... He you know, Barks

494
00:49:21,153 --> 00:49:24,023
Sometimes his villains are scary. Sometimes their confidence.

495
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:26,396
Sometimes they're like, incompetent.

496
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:32,154
But in this one, Chi is just like He's very unpleasant and he's very vicious.

497
00:49:32,932 --> 00:49:38,262
Right. And he's he's cut throat in this one just because he's firing a large art artillery

498
00:49:39,372 --> 00:49:39,872
Repeatedly,

499
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:42,203
he has this really, like,

500
00:49:42,961 --> 00:49:51,150
frightening green on his face. And and he he eventually blows their ship apart is really spectacular panel.

501
00:49:51,588 --> 00:50:05,377
Exactly but... No. I don't have the nineteen seventy Swedish edition Al hand, but it I know that three pages will cut. And if I will remember right, it's probably most likely this sequence because it's still violent

502
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:08,030
It is... Yeah. Usually, when when

503
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:17,918
the panels were cut, the pages were cut usually for violent or or scary content. Right? Yeah. Or sometimes, like, yes, just issues,

504
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:20,829
like, issues that were controversial.

505
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:24,835
So... But I don't think that this has been ever been cut in the Us.

506
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:32,411
Right. Yeah. I think that's right. If this is just another of those examples of you you guys can't really publish

507
00:50:32,765 --> 00:50:43,679
anything with this level of gun play at this point. Right? Exactly. Yeah. Well we can... But back in the seventies, I know that there were lots of sense don't know with lots of stories. Yeah. And it really

508
00:50:44,017 --> 00:50:48,432
escalate, you know, when when he blows the ship apart, he and his account

509
00:50:48,931 --> 00:50:49,810
turn around.

510
00:50:50,264 --> 00:51:12,505
And he kind of ponder how oh their ship has sun ports it's on the verge. It's going to sync without a trace. With no surviving witnesses to tell what happened. And Chi takes this really dark turn here because he's he's his thought balloon is tell us that he's kind of pondering, hey, no surviving witnesses, and he turns

511
00:51:13,179 --> 00:51:14,357
on his account,

512
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:15,833
joe here,

513
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,107
as imagine his head

514
00:51:18,604 --> 00:51:24,835
into the side of boat and then throw some over board. You just trying... It's pure killing here. Yeah

515
00:51:25,455 --> 00:51:37,345
This it's a pretty violent attempted murder. Yes. Yes. In is comic. I'm surprised that this back in the fifties of this to be published one they in the previous issue of the

516
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,825
back to the colombia, that was heavy

517
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:40,205
yeah.

518
00:51:41,245 --> 00:51:51,153
Fighting not. And that was not in killing us business. So... Yeah. But I know we I know we talked at length about that one when we recorded that episode

519
00:51:51,772 --> 00:51:54,244
Yeah. Did... Do you think it's because

520
00:51:54,664 --> 00:52:01,756
I don't know. It's maybe it's because the fight was, like, so just... The detail was so

521
00:52:02,255 --> 00:52:02,755
intense.

522
00:52:03,229 --> 00:52:09,443
And the camera cast such a loving eye and there was a woman present. I don't know. Yeah. But

523
00:52:09,942 --> 00:52:13,730
in this case... Well, Joe man just to survive by

524
00:52:14,147 --> 00:52:29,554
hanging on to this what's about the rope. Right. Is what the stuck in in a row hanging from the boat. And this is sort of gives a clue what's coming up later on in this story because Barks is always good at planting these small plot things. And

525
00:52:30,529 --> 00:52:33,940
what we could expect next in the story. But in way, Joe,

526
00:52:34,756 --> 00:52:36,373
Joe's manages to

527
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:43,815
climb back on the motor boat and since she's looks also on the board, he's now left Al sea

528
00:52:44,234 --> 00:52:48,350
left to to zone the docks are making me a rash, and and that goes fast.

529
00:52:50,362 --> 00:52:51,621
How do the make draft

530
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,077
just to minutes from the sinking ship. But anyway,

531
00:52:55,915 --> 00:52:59,546
they manage to survive the shit. Joe has left

532
00:53:00,165 --> 00:53:24,901
and she's a service left brownie. What will happen next Yeah. It's pretty dramatic. You're right. The raft building is is is pretty convenient. Although, I guess there have been a few stories where they've made some kind of ref before, maybe they're just experienced now. And, of course, they had some extra rope from flashing it together because we do see next to the next to the box of worst,

533
00:53:25,238 --> 00:53:26,792
there is a rope there. Yes.

534
00:53:27,669 --> 00:53:29,525
I I really like

535
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:40,600
Joe's little his last character b where he he forms. You know? We're we kinda feel sorry for him that Mix Huey, turned on him so quickly

536
00:53:41,035 --> 00:53:48,575
and and I think the reader is meant to to sense that his promise to go home and be a square

537
00:53:49,009 --> 00:53:59,113
because his mother always told him what what had happened if he got mixed up with crooks. I I think we're supposed to read that as very genuine. So I like that. I don't

538
00:53:59,732 --> 00:54:00,991
necessarily like how

539
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:01,729
underdeveloped.

540
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:07,680
He is. I felt like I could've cared a little bit more about him. If Barks had had another

541
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,440
four to eight to ten pages

542
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:15,540
to pad this story out a little bit. But I do like how he leaves.

543
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:19,662
Accept. Usually, Barks keep this the funny names.

544
00:54:20,221 --> 00:54:29,151
This guy just called Joe. No. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He's just he's just Joe is not he's not anything else. The next sequence,

545
00:54:29,609 --> 00:54:32,640
we get one page of the docks.

546
00:54:33,094 --> 00:54:49,212
On the raft with with Scrooge really at his low point. Right? He... The debts are trying to tell him, you know, why would you bring that horse strategy board. We have no chance of getting it there tomorrow. Scrooge makes this really kinda touching

547
00:54:49,564 --> 00:55:11,377
I'd admission, you know, he says you're right nephew. But my case is hopeless, but I just haven't the strength. To give up. Right? Like, I think he's saying he he just can't bear the thought of not being a richest stuck in the world anymore. It it... It's almost he would have to be stronger than he is to give up. Yeah. Yeah. And they ponder...

548
00:55:11,754 --> 00:55:17,774
They they wish that Mcs get a bad break. And just at that moment, they do see him drifting

549
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:18,651
into

550
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:20,687
in the ocean. And,

551
00:55:21,225 --> 00:55:32,655
you know, Donald is able to to grab his arm as as mixed pathetic beg to be saved, And this is really the, like, this is kind of the full of the story. Right?

552
00:55:33,588 --> 00:55:39,315
This is a very important moment where we see sp just pondering the advantage

553
00:55:39,693 --> 00:55:43,283
that he's got. I I I I really like every

554
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:46,958
expression on his face during this overall sequence.

555
00:55:47,297 --> 00:55:53,086
Yeah. Especially panel six it's one of those panels where we can see the character thinking

556
00:55:53,465 --> 00:55:57,580
without reading in thought anything. It's that Barks

557
00:55:58,114 --> 00:56:32,520
far away look. No one does like a far away look better than Karl barb. You're right? And now to the next page, I'm bridge is very determined. He will not stay she's like suit. But then again, pass him back to the phone right. He says I a soft old fool. I can't let the rack. And of course, he saves the villain He does something that he might wanna do, but he a soft old fool. So She's saved he's on the rash and there he discovers that it's overloaded with the horse. Branch.

558
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:45,020
And of course, it's happened. He put it into the water two thinks okay I want. It's all done. Post forever. And then the expression on Scrooge thinks. He he just staring the water

559
00:56:45,400 --> 00:57:00,174
staring at this lost portion but lies there in the deed, it's all of. And to top that off, she's a like now wants to kill the the five dollars. Yeah. This is this is... I think this is the best part of the story. Yeah. That's my... This this is

560
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:02,526
it's very tense.

561
00:57:02,864 --> 00:57:04,201
So we motion.

562
00:57:04,538 --> 00:57:06,194
Yeah. I see the characters

563
00:57:06,771 --> 00:57:14,343
drives them and and the person do of screws. Yeah. We see Scrooge being very human. Right? He's very tempted

564
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,297
to make his life easier.

565
00:57:16,769 --> 00:57:20,700
He... He doesn't have to save him. It is of choice. He has to affirmative

566
00:57:21,317 --> 00:57:26,725
choose to do it, but he's gonna be able to live with himself. He knows he couldn't have lived with himself.

567
00:57:27,365 --> 00:57:32,065
Another one donation character. I mean, Barks always treated his characters

568
00:57:32,605 --> 00:57:32,965
humans.

569
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,440
Yeah. And

570
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:43,474
boy mix suit just looks... He's just such a router on this page. You just you hate him so much. Have you ever hated?

571
00:57:43,954 --> 00:57:47,815
Have you ever hated a villain and and just found them as dis?

572
00:57:48,714 --> 00:57:49,030
Like

573
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:55,649
I've seen guam gold stories where, like, he's got a little bit tiny bit of humanity

574
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:59,830
where where we we appreciate him because he's that echo of Scrooge

575
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:03,702
before Barb, you know, just gave up and made him very villainous.

576
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:22,308
And and Man is just hilarious and the beetle boys are half plus, but but so. Here they say his live. And in the next moment, He tries to go them. He's so darn ill. Was this scene was later reused by Barks. In the phase

577
00:58:22,686 --> 00:58:24,264
in the store, the great.

578
00:58:24,921 --> 00:58:26,019
Right. Was the

579
00:58:26,517 --> 00:58:37,148
the pig. What was his name and this? It's the the mix wine, whatever whatever his word it's it's it's one in the mc versions. Right? Yeah. I don't remember his name in that one.

580
00:58:37,826 --> 00:58:39,437
Al make Oh, yes.

581
00:58:40,314 --> 00:58:43,724
That's a great name. Yeah. It it's a similar scene

582
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:45,896
in the end of that story. Yeah.

583
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:51,176
Was the say he's lie and he would just lay favor by trying to build. Yeah.

584
00:58:52,014 --> 00:59:01,128
Yeah. Barb had some... Had some pretty good villains I I feel like you could've have re... And we'll talk about it. But it's interesting that he's a one off bill. Yeah.

585
00:59:02,485 --> 00:59:13,913
This is a very satisfying scene on the next page Mix two is about to bash them overboard Donald just asks all the Ducktales haven't we taken enough

586
00:59:14,568 --> 00:59:15,683
from this tough.

587
00:59:16,201 --> 00:59:18,454
And he rolls up his sleeves

588
00:59:19,205 --> 00:59:22,225
and and all the docks reply affirmative,

589
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:22,765
yes.

590
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:27,425
And they beat the living snot out of chi.

591
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:32,190
And the next it's it's great. Right? Like the audience cheers,

592
00:59:33,045 --> 00:59:38,920
this is all the routers have waited for. Yeah. And of course, in a addition story,

593
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:42,845
revenge by hitting someone might not be the

594
00:59:43,261 --> 00:59:53,120
the thing to do. But It works. Well, and and they are being defensive in this specific moment. Right? He about to use a giant board to bash him off

595
00:59:53,755 --> 01:00:02,855
So by the next day, they finally get a break of good weather. But but, you know, it's come too late for sp. He's just laying there for lauren.

596
01:00:03,409 --> 01:00:06,859
Mix, of course, has been tied up, and he's tackling

597
01:00:07,356 --> 01:00:08,613
and in one hour,

598
01:00:08,951 --> 01:00:11,086
he is gonna be the richest ty

599
01:00:11,543 --> 01:00:16,394
in the world And boy think about sc in that spot, you know?

600
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:20,214
Sitting there while this man

601
01:00:21,049 --> 01:00:21,249
Al

602
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:23,549
knowing that Scrooge doesn't

603
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:45,149
doesn't have it in him to toss him overboard. And and things keep turning up as they spot a sea plain, which turns out to be a coast guard that has been looking for the Inducks party and the the page closes out with the Nephews telling the the crew that their uncle will pay them well to fly him to Jamaica.

604
01:00:45,644 --> 01:00:49,719
To Scrooge just confusion. Yeah. Why should we wanna go to Jamaica?

605
01:00:50,598 --> 01:00:51,218
And an

606
01:00:51,677 --> 01:01:00,092
replies to deliver this or values because here is the reason why Barks but all this world next to the post strategy

607
01:01:00,549 --> 01:01:11,747
a few pages earlier, because they they figured out. That makes you would kick it all the board so they tied it to align to detect line to the box. So it's it's Al outside. And now, it's she's a.

608
01:01:12,099 --> 01:01:18,553
Turn to get devastated. Yeah. Of course, if there's a he's route because he he he can't see his own

609
01:01:19,012 --> 01:01:21,449
that he's doing anything wrong. So is it's good?

610
01:01:21,984 --> 01:01:28,734
Nice turn. Things happens is very very fast to it. It's things happens very fast on these few pages.

611
01:01:29,628 --> 01:01:30,888
It's like the advantage.

612
01:01:31,307 --> 01:01:31,807
Right

613
01:01:32,225 --> 01:01:35,621
the the terms, the the the Ducktales.

614
01:01:35,701 --> 01:01:43,314
The advantage changes. It shift so quickly. But the tables turn. Yeah. Yeah. And then we're back and after

615
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,165
we see that just like.

616
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:48,155
But he's been robbed. It's all happy docs

617
01:01:48,692 --> 01:01:54,860
on the pages on the panels after. Well, happy Scrooge not happy because he owes

618
01:01:55,934 --> 01:02:00,874
the other docs, two hundred and twenty six dollars. And and other things that's fortune.

619
01:02:02,588 --> 01:02:15,545
And one of the net pay will we force this contract as good as solving that can't for that, but and then it comes perhaps, you should read the small print The small print, the Scrooge

620
01:02:16,505 --> 01:02:24,463
explains is that it hooked? Yes. And then if you says, it says that you will pay on the demand. We will leave the box of course spanish.

621
01:02:25,181 --> 01:02:29,804
And of course, screw test the payout. Yeah. It's from all the previous violence,

622
01:02:30,141 --> 01:02:41,006
we know how this funny ending that Barks planned for in the beginning of the story. Ties it very well to together. Yeah. It's it's a great triumph in moment for the Nephews. Right?

623
01:02:41,964 --> 01:02:48,874
The the young readers reading this They they feel great, I think because the Nephews had their clever idea

624
01:02:49,174 --> 01:02:52,154
of tying it secretly to that line

625
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:56,789
and then we get to see that payoff with the fine print.

626
01:02:57,269 --> 01:03:10,967
It it's a nice little ending beef. I wonder how many kids try this with the their parents. Signing contracts some tiny if I prints the bottom. Right. For that they will connect slide thing or something. Sure. Absolutely.

627
01:03:11,465 --> 01:03:15,957
So so that's it. That's the yep that's the very brisk

628
01:03:16,454 --> 01:03:22,665
adventure story the the horse rad story. Yeah. It really clips along. It really flies.

629
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:30,974
There are there are some stories that I think could media benefit from editing, and maybe they don't need to be thirty two pages.

630
01:03:31,513 --> 01:03:43,269
But like, this is the babe question for me of this story. Right? I guess there's two questions. Is it as good as most people think? And is it too short And, like, maybe I'm kind of

631
01:03:44,246 --> 01:03:54,809
showing my bias here. But I I do think this one suffers a bit from being a little bit too short. I think it's enough. Because it it hasn't quiet moments. It has its adventure

632
01:03:55,147 --> 01:03:59,935
if it not too long, not too short. And maybe it will have this fun games pages,

633
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:03,166
in the beginning the tricia so the the...

634
01:04:03,585 --> 01:04:08,874
And we have the signed of the storm. I mean, he devote almost two pages. Mh.

635
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:16,885
Well, the doctors is waiting for the storm to begin I I think you're right about that part. I think the storm is paced perfectly.

636
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:22,899
Can I tell you what what I missed though? Sure. I missed the third

637
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:31,494
contract gag. Okay. I needed one more. Right? Barks is usually really good when he's got a good running gag.

638
01:04:33,174 --> 01:04:39,400
I I think, you know, we've... It's it's more like big big themed little theme. Right? We've got the big

639
01:04:39,897 --> 01:04:40,397
overarching

640
01:04:40,855 --> 01:04:48,364
aspect with the contract and the fine print and then we've got the small one. But I would love to have seen

641
01:04:48,904 --> 01:05:05,204
some other small print element in this. To to do that sort of comedic rule of three that he was usually really good about. I I needed a little bit more with Joe. I I either needed Joe to not be there at all where I needed, I needed a little bit more development.

642
01:05:05,659 --> 01:05:21,396
To make me either hate him more or love him more. But he just kinda... He just kinda jets off, and that's all. Except what I mean, if he had been in the beginning of the story, together was she so when they entered Scrooge from my dot money. I think that would benefit

643
01:05:21,948 --> 01:05:35,516
this store yes but the lawyers in the the lawyer in the Golden Health story. Yeah. Exactly. Or or he could've walked in Midway because I did like. I did like the silhouette introduction. I did like the solitary

644
01:05:35,854 --> 01:05:40,785
man. I also needed I needed I needed one more flash.

645
01:05:41,218 --> 01:06:12,049
You know, I needed... I think I needed that to book or something. I I I like this story. I think this is a really good story. But when I... This has been an interesting and unique one for me, lucky you because it's the... Like I said, it's the only one that I barely remember. Yes. It just didn't It didn't leave it's Barks. And I've been looking forward to going back to this because it's almost like reading it for the first time. I remembered it so poorly. Yeah. Same year actually.

646
01:06:12,627 --> 01:06:15,459
It's it's a it's okay. It's it's a got some

647
01:06:15,999 --> 01:06:18,539
superb great scenes especially towards the end

648
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:21,499
squeezed in between back to the

649
01:06:21,879 --> 01:06:23,434
and the Hawaiian story

650
01:06:23,892 --> 01:06:27,103
a romantic story that I think they're more memorable

651
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:34,579
than this one. I totally agree. I think just just by din of where it is. Like, I I have... I have such high

652
01:06:34,959 --> 01:06:38,539
expectations for it. It's on Scrooge number three.

653
01:06:38,919 --> 01:06:39,419
So

654
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,553
And if you compare this door to many other...

655
01:06:43,091 --> 01:06:43,591
Dis.

656
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:46,966
That was not Barks by this time it's it's it's about piece.

657
01:06:47,526 --> 01:06:48,799
Your always compare

658
01:06:49,219 --> 01:06:50,138
but the Barks

659
01:06:50,617 --> 01:07:02,054
at the top of this game with all these stores though. Right. It won't storage. It's not a fantastic story in my opinion. It works. Yeah. Now it it did a lot right. Like, you said the the ocean stuff...

660
01:07:02,533 --> 01:07:07,598
I mean, he... This this he's so comfortable. He so loves drawing the ocean.

661
01:07:08,096 --> 01:07:39,605
Every bit of that is just great. I I do like Chi Mcs Al a villain. What do you think should he have come back Well, he did in some european stories. No doubt. Yes. When I was a kid, I remember reading about in in a story hold on here and Yeah. But while you look, I'll just... I'll just ponder, like, if he had come back in another box story. Right? Would that might have had more impact. Right? Because, like, we really remember that first appearance long

662
01:07:40,078 --> 01:07:44,374
First parents magic on the Beagle boys. I I do love to hate Mix,

663
01:07:44,713 --> 01:07:45,213
but

664
01:07:45,592 --> 01:07:49,984
I I like his character design a lot. Tail. I'm trying to find

665
01:07:50,644 --> 01:07:54,664
second appearance. Yeah. Here it is. This is a story that I read

666
01:07:55,244 --> 01:07:59,051
kid in the light must have been nineteen eighty d here.

667
01:07:59,889 --> 01:08:09,333
The, the roots battle ax. Oh oh I remember that. Yes. It was apology in the Us Barks ninety two. Yeah. Can we

668
01:08:09,789 --> 01:08:11,006
the breeze apple?

669
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:17,198
Drawn by the car. Mh. And this was my first encounter with the she's alex.

670
01:08:17,599 --> 01:08:23,427
I guess they wouldn't have in mine as well. Technically although I I obviously don't remember it that well. Yeah. Because

671
01:08:24,005 --> 01:08:25,104
back in the eighties,

672
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:26,820
the editors and

673
01:08:27,398 --> 01:08:37,330
who's no in Copenhagen. They tried to make sort of new bark stores drawn in bark style but Mh most the car yeah

674
01:08:38,443 --> 01:08:44,096
they're inspired by storage big techniques and they brought Barks some characters like it's just like

675
01:08:44,756 --> 01:08:51,669
gold, etcetera. Who wouldn't you know, love to use Barks characters. Right? It's it's a natural

676
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:55,149
tendency. I'm sure Well, let's see. Let's

677
01:08:55,569 --> 01:09:13,038
let's go go over. We're we're getting some good reflections in for this. Well, I'm I'm gonna talk about the consensus then we can keep reflecting as much as we want. So, you know, I I did mention that this one is very well recorded. Even if it's not my favorite or yours,

678
01:09:13,533 --> 01:09:26,827
There a lot of Ducktales fans who would list this as one of as one of their favorites, and if you check it out on Inducks, it's currently got an eight point four rating out of ten, which is good for number fourteen

679
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:36,727
overall out of all nearly forty one thousand Disney comic stories. I do have to imagine it's a little bit inflated just because it's uncle Scrooge number.

680
01:09:37,286 --> 01:09:37,786
Three

681
01:09:38,165 --> 01:09:39,024
it is

682
01:09:39,419 --> 01:09:45,952
during his golden age where he could pretty much do no wrong. And of course, like he mentioned it's referenced

683
01:09:46,332 --> 01:09:47,111
so heavily

684
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:50,364
in in Don Roses as great life and times

685
01:09:50,864 --> 01:09:51,364
series.

686
01:09:51,783 --> 01:09:54,184
So I think it just... It feels very, like,

687
01:09:54,984 --> 01:10:02,379
screwed canon. To people. Yep. Yeah. I guess so. You you did me the favor of mentioning that Chi

688
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:06,434
has been used again. I think in at least a couple of stories.

689
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:10,934
That battle acts one being one of them. Never by Barks,

690
01:10:12,093 --> 01:10:25,697
Rosa, course will have referenced tim in in the life and times. And and Rosa will have referenced, you know, cfo phone, Mc, and and the gold teeth themselves. We do see that moment in the life and times when sp

691
01:10:26,116 --> 01:10:28,029
turns the teeth into his

692
01:10:28,488 --> 01:10:29,466
steak for

693
01:10:30,043 --> 01:10:30,903
his prospecting

694
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:31,820
outfit.

695
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:38,640
This one was one of the stories that also got adapted into an episode of Ducktales.

696
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:44,834
The... Oh, really? Yeah. The original Ducktales series, I think there were only about twenty.

697
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:56,773
Stories roughly. I'm probably getting that wrong. That were like adapted into episodes. And and this is one of them. It is an episode called down and out in Ducktales.

698
01:10:57,073 --> 01:10:58,933
It uses an original character

699
01:10:59,513 --> 01:11:00,734
instead of chi mcs,

700
01:11:01,473 --> 01:11:03,933
and they're not delivering horse.

701
01:11:04,608 --> 01:11:11,572
Oh, I think they're delivering marble if I remember. Right? Okay. But but in the same way that I somehow

702
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:18,303
didn't get to see that read the story for a long time, it was one of the, like, small number of duck

703
01:11:18,723 --> 01:11:19,164
episodes.

704
01:11:19,658 --> 01:11:23,947
That I, like missed out on when I was a Scrooge obsessed kid in nineteen

705
01:11:24,484 --> 01:11:32,355
eighty seven. So I I have no memory of the so whatsoever. K. I was so much looking forward to these Ducktales

706
01:11:32,953 --> 01:11:34,849
tv cartridges those bit and

707
01:11:35,585 --> 01:11:37,898
say what's the eighty to seven? I think it's...

708
01:11:38,616 --> 01:11:44,669
Start eighty six I started launching it, I think, an eighty seven if I remember right. I could

709
01:11:45,205 --> 01:11:46,794
unless spend around twelve

710
01:11:47,372 --> 01:11:53,299
And I read about them in Gladstone comments, you know, the first issue of on the of ventures was

711
01:11:53,797 --> 01:11:55,069
to be a Ducktales

712
01:11:55,288 --> 01:12:02,563
comics, and saw the ads for the... For this in the economics, but the thing was. Sweden. It was only showing

713
01:12:03,393 --> 01:12:40,833
three. That was not a shana I had. But had had friends seeing it, oh seemed to be so good. And I sort a few years later. I mean, those was too late to be hooked on it as a sort kid. Yeah. From kids perspective. I was so disappointed saw and I. Yeah. I I hear you. I loved it. As a kid, I discovered the comics probably, like, six to nine months before I discovered the show. So even then I was like, oh, this isn't right. It didn't get this right. But but I loved Scrooge and Donald so much that... And and the theme song was so rousing

714
01:12:41,252 --> 01:12:42,311
and the animation

715
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:46,586
was very strong compared to most other things on Tv

716
01:12:47,005 --> 01:12:47,945
at the time

717
01:12:48,404 --> 01:12:57,469
that that for all of its flaws, I think it's easy to understand why a generation of kids, you know, really loved it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So

718
01:12:57,943 --> 01:13:07,501
Any other thoughts you are before we talk about before we wrap it up and talk about some favorite panels? There's another story called delivery dilemma

719
01:13:07,918 --> 01:13:08,817
from the

720
01:13:09,274 --> 01:13:15,170
from ninety to sixty four. And comments and store not two hundred and ninety one. That I think is kinda

721
01:13:15,627 --> 01:13:17,044
related to this story.

722
01:13:17,502 --> 01:13:23,518
It's supported that it's not original by Barks, but I think that it henry been reroute it. And it's all the story about

723
01:13:23,938 --> 01:13:45,468
delivering something and find friends in this case, the bigger boys in the disguise once have screws to deliver wild rubbed eggs or the king's children. And, of course, there's a fine range that he has to sign sign way is type fortune to the bigger voice if it fails to deliver with those eggs. It's kind similar. You see, it's

724
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:48,768
related to to the other story. Yeah. Sure.

725
01:13:49,903 --> 01:13:51,400
Was a original writer

726
01:13:52,217 --> 01:14:17,237
spider Barks store or debug Al this kind of talk thing to the story afterwards. And do we know who the original writer was? I don't think so. Yeah. I mean, it's a it's a good concept especially if you're a kid, the idea of contract they there's such a powerful piece of paper. So it works on an adult and a kid level, I think. Yeah know. Let's let's go ahead and highlight if you... Ya'll...

727
01:14:17,776 --> 01:14:26,599
Are there any panels that really stand out to you? Oh, good favorite panels, favorite paths of to me, it's always the emotional,

728
01:14:27,575 --> 01:14:32,119
like, it in the end here, where we see... You mentioned the Barks there

729
01:14:33,255 --> 01:14:34,234
screws thinking.

730
01:14:34,851 --> 01:14:35,351
Eleven.

731
01:14:35,969 --> 01:14:40,180
Yeah. Yeah. That sequence is great where where the dots are really

732
01:14:40,614 --> 01:14:50,788
where Scrooge is really pondering, you know, and thinking. I also like his kind of grid. We can see a little bit of his teeth, but it's not creepy like, his ancestor.

733
01:14:52,206 --> 01:14:54,904
Where he's like got that sort of steel

734
01:14:55,483 --> 01:15:08,207
determination, you know, that panel ate on that page. Yeah. And of course, with magnificent title panel. Yeah. Let's sucks way into the story. Yeah. That's an easy call. I I really like the

735
01:15:08,917 --> 01:15:09,417
silhouette

736
01:15:10,152 --> 01:15:13,161
the Ducktales just beating up chi mc

737
01:15:13,777 --> 01:15:17,484
on that raf and too. I think that a great panel. Yeah.

738
01:15:17,904 --> 01:15:18,464
Maybe Barks

739
01:15:19,144 --> 01:15:22,904
did wet because can you that since, you know,

740
01:15:23,624 --> 01:15:24,684
back to the clone?

741
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:31,850
But I've seen Al big cut away. Yeah. We played the same pair. Right. Yeah You also noticed two that it's

742
01:15:32,484 --> 01:15:35,621
It's an action packed panel, but it's a very modestly

743
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,335
sized one. So Yeah. He's he might be playing that game there hiding his violence.

744
01:15:41,848 --> 01:15:44,701
Similarly that violence step, pretty violent

745
01:15:45,078 --> 01:15:51,300
sc between Mc and Joe. He really, I think, got away with what he could just right at the edge.

746
01:15:51,953 --> 01:15:52,972
Yeah. And

747
01:15:53,311 --> 01:16:01,196
that unusual scene that I mentioned before we only see the ship and of the Barks. It's a yeah unusual

748
01:16:01,669 --> 01:16:03,689
page in this account. We're actually

749
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:05,090
no regular

750
01:16:05,669 --> 01:16:08,269
console or Al. Yeah. That's a good point.

751
01:16:08,843 --> 01:16:25,662
Why the ship rats all look really nice as well. There really are a lot of panels in this one. I just I wish the story added up. To a little bit more. Yeah. It's it's a very enjoyable one. It's just not never one that I was gonna sit down and and read

752
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:31,695
every night for a week, you know, the way I probably did when I first got back to the cl.

753
01:16:32,215 --> 01:16:36,086
Or any other number of stories. Awesome. Any other

754
01:16:36,424 --> 01:16:38,917
