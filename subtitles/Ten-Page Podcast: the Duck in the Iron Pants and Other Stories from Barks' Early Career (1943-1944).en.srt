1
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:09,384
We have

2
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:34,464
Hello, and welcome to Barks Remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comics of all time. This episode is a ten page podcast, all about one of his short stories. Get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome back to Barks remarks,

3
00:00:34,943 --> 00:00:50,045
we are back with a very special episode of what I call the ten page podcast Usually, we pick one or two of Barks short ten page stories to discuss. But today, we're gonna do something a little bit different

4
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:57,019
and I think very special, we are gonna talk about a group of no less than five

5
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,795
stories from the du man's

6
00:00:59,254 --> 00:01:04,555
very early career. And and I got a little more pro log, but I've got a c

7
00:01:05,174 --> 00:01:12,450
that I'm very excited to have bad So I'll let him introduce himself. Hey mark warren harmon and back again enjoying these

8
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:32,950
early comments so much really looking forward to our discussion and kinda tracking Carl Barks his early career. So excited. Yeah. This will be fun. Yeah. I I agree. I am very excited touch on it. You know, when I when I started this podcast series, I was thinking long and hard about it. And I really was like gotta focus.

9
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:37,904
On those adventure stories, those longer stories, you know. That's my format

10
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:43,558
and and I really wanted to stick to it. Because there were just so many of the ten pages.

11
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:53,319
But but I ultimately did decide that it made a lot of sense to be a little bit flexible so that I could get the the special ten page podcast

12
00:01:53,697 --> 00:02:07,949
episodes in and like I compromised where I was like, I'm gonna stick with the spirit of what I'm doing by by numbering those longer at so and labeling these others as the ten page podcast. But but it means I didn't make that decision

13
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,030
until

14
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:23,867
a couple of months in. And so it means that I I passed by all of these great old stories that really showed some of his, like, evolution So so I thought about it. And I was like oh, this is this is the perfect

15
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:28,291
compromise, You know, we're gonna we're gonna talk about five really

16
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:31,975
interesting stories here, none of which would really...

17
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:43,129
None of them really have enough meat in them, I think to merit their own episode, even a shared one. But but what we're gonna do today is talk about those stories

18
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,584
summarize them in a lot less detail than we usually would and then we're gonna

19
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:49,905
think about what it says

20
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:52,785
about the Ducktales man's early career

21
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:56,120
and his evolution. So so warren

22
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:11,895
how do you feel in general? You know, about these early ten pages the first part of his career. Right. Right. And and coming off of his partnership with Jack hannah, and finds pirate gold in in nineteen forty two where he kinda got a taste of the comic book

23
00:03:12,315 --> 00:03:24,081
industry and and got to experience the art as you said, this is that was a great word, the evolution of the artist and the writer. And I think why I think these stories are so important is that they

24
00:03:24,635 --> 00:03:27,935
paved the way to what he mastered later in his life.

25
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:52,992
So you see a lot of that moments in these stories that say, hey, I remember seeing that kind of thing happened in lost in the Andy or like of the north or those longer form stories. So here's a man who at the age of about forty or forty one. He's over forty is over forty. Yeah. And he's got this twenty three year career left and this he's just getting started,

26
00:03:53,369 --> 00:04:05,845
and that just amaze me. And this why I'm so excited because I think as an individual and as a creative individual, I think he just wants to tell the stories It it's it's really critically important that we understand where Carl Barks.

27
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:08,478
Yeah. I I fully agree.

28
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:14,170
That's why I definitely think it's important to cover these stories as part of this podcast project.

29
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:29,752
But but I also think they're very enjoyable and fun. And you made a great point there about this stage of his life. And I think about that a lot. Right? Because, like, he... This is... I don't know how many careers in into his

30
00:04:30,783 --> 00:04:56,514
into his life. But this is certainly not his first career. And this is a really big change to have made at this age at this stage his life. I would say this is his third career. You know, when he started out and and he started with the the the Cal eye opener and and he had that publishing and editing experience with the incompetence in Minneapolis that he had to work with for those early years. Then he got fed up with that and went to

31
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:11,124
California back to California and and looked in liquidate did it Disney. While working in the story department and working on the donald Dutch shorts, and then he said, look, I'm gonna move seventy five miles with my first wife, Clara to the small community.

32
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:39,144
Where the weather is beautiful, the mountains are beautiful, and I'm gonna set up my little freelance practice there and see what I can do. I mean, this is his third attempt and he's known in his forties, and I can kinda relate to that. I I jumped from one long career in mini minneapolis listen at the age of forty two, I moved to Rochester and started something new. So... Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. I I relate too, you know, I'm I'm at about that stage in my life right now, and I'm I'm looking at a little bit of a shift within my own career

33
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:49,180
and doing doing this series it's impossible not to think of that. And and it's I I find it really inspiring. Right? Because he obviously had a lot of his best

34
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,199
work ahead of him still. Oh,

35
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:56,616
extremely inspiring, and he had the talent no question. But what I think was

36
00:05:56,952 --> 00:06:24,020
incredibly fortunate about this period for him. Everything lined up the stars aligned. He had people who trusted him. They didn't second guess, him we'll talk about the first story here and how the editor just said Wow. You know, here you go. You you can do this in yeah, they they did get them a lot of latitude for these. Right? But but I also get the impression that he was one of those people who really tried to, like, make his own luck. You know, he he put himself in the right place. He obviously

37
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:27,525
built up a lot of goodwill as someone who is reliable,

38
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:34,420
working on those Disney shorts and and these, you know, it should be said that these serve as a great bridge

39
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:42,590
between the work that he did on those cartoon shorts, especially Donald Duck, and what he's gonna go on to do with the dot com. But, you know,

40
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:45,259
when he got that opportunity

41
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:48,548
to do pirate gold with Jack hannah,

42
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:52,576
my read is that they really liked what they saw.

43
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,922
Yeah. And and they really must have liked the sales

44
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,760
outcome.

45
00:06:57,297 --> 00:07:09,143
Oh, yes. And I think that probably gave him the confidence to think that he could he could do this. I I understand he gave himself a little bit of an insurance policy where he he brought a bunch of...

46
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:12,057
Did you bring a bunch of chicken Scrooge with?

47
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:14,425
To send and.

48
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:20,842
Yeah. Yeah. Yep. He brought his chickens and his chicken coupe and like the way they say with his wife and

49
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:25,380
they kinda set up a little kinda like, okay. This doesn't work out. I'll be a chat before.

50
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:32,477
Here's is the fall path. Well... And and and is he had previous careers doing other, like, very outdoor

51
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:44,180
rural stuff. Right? Didn't do some like some sort of ranch hand or trapping or or not this twenties. Yeah. And his twenties and growing up. I think he was always outdoors.

52
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:59,587
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Well, I'm I'm getting excited to talk about these. So are you ready the launch into warranty? Do you any any other pre game. I think I think we'll just kind of talk about the evolution here and it starts with well Disney comics and stories

53
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:00,805
number thirty one.

54
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:19,389
Yeah. Let me let me list them off really, but So we're gonna be talking today about the Victory garden from walt Disney's comics and stories, number thirty one in April of nineteen forty three, followed by the Rabbit foot and the next issue. Walt disney Comments and stories thirty two then we're gonna be covering

55
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:31,031
Salesman Donald in issue number thirty nine, followed by the Ducktales the iron pants and number forty one. And finally, the chemist number forty four. And

56
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:38,073
let's let's talk about why we're doing the ones we are. Right? I I think

57
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:48,139
I think that any project like this we really have to cover the victory Barks. Right Warren. What why is that? Well, the Victory garden was Carl Barks is first

58
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,220
opportunity to draw an original

59
00:08:51,720 --> 00:09:08,034
ten page story for walt disney comments and stories and and since he moved away from Burbank and and the Disney studios and kinda ended his career with walt Disney as a staff he pulled pulled all his stops and became a freelancer He settled into this area where he could really

60
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:09,512
exercise his creative

61
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:10,990
skills. And

62
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:17,984
they gave him this opportunity. It says in donald Al book, and I wanna give credit to the research here that

63
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:28,411
he believes the woman's name was Eleanor Packer who was an editor who gave him that opportunity to draw this story. Now this was not an original

64
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:37,286
story either though. Think the the thing to note here is that he was handed to script or an outline. I and it was as he says, it was a rather

65
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:47,705
indefinite sort of script. I worked it over and it made more sense out of it. And it was one of the things that they were kinda testing Carl Barks here in his ability to come up with something

66
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,225
that would cap cap

67
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:52,105
and get the editors at Western

68
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:56,479
printing excited. Yeah. I I think you've got it. Right? He...

69
00:09:57,536 --> 00:10:01,827
The bit that I have that Jeffrey Blu had written in there

70
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:04,720
of the graphic novel that I read most of these in.

71
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:20,770
Just notes that, you know, he was allowed to strengthen what he thought. Needed punching up, but but that he focused most of his effort on the art. So did. And the art is fantastic. Anything shows in my opinion, it shows an evolution from finds pirate gold and

72
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:36,838
of this expressive donald Inducks that we see today. I think it's closer to what what he ended up with. I think he had a had great opportunity to to really work on the art on this story. So yeah. Let's let's talk about the Victory garden. Should we start there? Yeah. Absolutely.

73
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:38,834
We're. We're gonna go chronological.

74
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:39,912
So...

75
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:46,165
Okay. So so go ahead, Warren tell us tell us about the main action that give us a good summary

76
00:10:46,665 --> 00:10:54,827
of the victory guard. Yeah. It's important to note that regarding were real popular Al the Height of World War two in in America, United Kingdom,

77
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:57,500
Australia, other parts of the World Canada.

78
00:10:57,994 --> 00:10:59,333
And these were

79
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,131
gardens that

80
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:12,920
citizens of the countries were encouraged to grow to help the war effort. To grow their own food, but what I thought fascinating about it was it was a spirit builder. It was a Al builder. For the citizens

81
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:26,076
during this incredibly horrible war and and it was an opportunity to get out and plant community gardens and vacant lots and in backyard and so the The story the Victory garden opens with Don is nephews

82
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:55,167
real real quick. I'm sorry interrupt, but... Oh no. That that's that's important. I appreciate you defining like, what a victory garden is. Right? Because it's presented in this story is something that every reader. Would would know about. Did you know what a victory garden was before you originally read this story? I did. My my mom was ten years old in nineteen forty three, and she remembers planting her victory garden in Minneapolis. That's cool. I

83
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:21,915
I had no idea. What a Victory guard was. I learned about it literally from this comic oh about the age of ten years old. Oh wow. And and I had to... I I can't remember if I asked someone or if I looked it up pre Google, but I I did not know because there's no real direct reference in the story. To war. Right? They just they're are just talking about we're gonna start up a victory garden Yeah.

84
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:27,635
And and it really interests me that you don't really see them in other pop culture.

85
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:32,342
Like, go. You don't really see them in other comics. You you rarely

86
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:49,710
see them referenced in movies of the time. Right It was Al an effort that maybe was grassroots roots maybe it started. I don't know if the government encouraged it. I probably did I I think there was a big, you know, problem and effort. Yeah. To to get them and and we... We know that there was a lot of

87
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,030
Donald duck

88
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:51,970
propaganda,

89
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,155
material, mate, too. So I I have to think that this is probably

90
00:12:56,571 --> 00:12:57,550
something that

91
00:12:58,046 --> 00:13:02,110
maybe got reworked out of some of that because You know, I wanted.

92
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:09,630
Donald really went to Barks for the war first. He did. A good friend of mine just sold his entire

93
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:12,038
Donald Ducktales war collection

94
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:15,826
at Heritage auctions, and he lives in Minneapolis. And

95
00:13:16,203 --> 00:13:18,536
anyway, donald Duck, that I think the other

96
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:26,451
part of this is that we're at the height of World war two, but you made the point and it was the right point that that Donald Inducks became sort of the the visual

97
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:40,834
symbol of the war for Disney as walt Disney entered the war effort, and I'm gonna say, whether I'm right or wrong or whatever, I'm gonna say that Donald Inducks or past mickey mouse and popularity during these years in terms of, you know, in the comics in the short cartoons

98
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:41,673
popular

99
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:42,592
consciousness.

100
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:45,484
Right. No arguments here. Absolutely.

101
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:55,590
And that's what excited me probably would got me excited about collecting donald Inducks. So, yeah, the story begins with Donald and the boys wanting to plant a Victory garden and

102
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:04,283
what I really love is that as they begin planting this victory garden an earnest, you see these three cro sitting up on the on the line and

103
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:10,316
immediately reminded me of the of the cro in the movie dumb that was premier two years earlier.

104
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:21,647
They're sassy. They're kinda commenting the Mag pis... I have a feeling Carl Barks is inspired by the Cro from Dumb. And as they are excited about seeing this victory garden, though, they

105
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:24,839
they see food on their table, and so they

106
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:35,885
rip off the pole and start getting eating the food. Donald gets fed up with it and calls them sa and throws things at them and and That's yeah. Right.

107
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:37,905
To her.

108
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:40,025
Because because they're, like

109
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:41,685
his his war effort,

110
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:42,705
exactly

111
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:53,433
exactly and who knows if the cro symbolic in any way to the to the axis I doubt. But but it's... They're sort of the trouble makers here. There are there are three of them. Yeah.

112
00:14:54,510 --> 00:15:05,633
Yeah. So the the overarching theme here is Donald attempt to plant a victory garden. Every chance he gets gets t, and so he he tries it in his yard. He goes to a vacant

113
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,590
lot

114
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:07,826
in the neighborhood.

115
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:20,642
Beautifully, I just have to point out at the... What is it? The corner of faith and hope? I love that. And such. And then he he does everything to try to deceive these crow and dress up you know a women's custom,

116
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:34,344
and it doesn't fool them And so every attempt whether it's the crow or the boys playing football on the garden, he plant in the vacant lot. He just he just gives up. And it... I love the ending when

117
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:46,115
the boys and conveniently go to the seat store find and invisible seeds. And they t the grows by opening the bag and there's nothing there. And they presented it to Donald and his bed, while, he's

118
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:48,805
Severino from his football

119
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:49,965
catastrophe.

120
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:53,825
It throws the bag against the wall in the next morning voila.

121
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:59,774
The Victory guardian is growing in his bedroom, Really fun. That that that was a great synopsis.

122
00:16:00,313 --> 00:16:02,651
Warren that this is a really interesting

123
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:18,490
story to start with. Right? Because some some parts of this really do feel like it's right out of the cartoon, you know, that especially that element with the, like, invisible seeds, that feels like something that would happened in one of the cartoons whether they're like, this is gonna be fun.

124
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:52,541
Slaps stick and silly, and we don't care why they're invisible. We're not gonna explain that they're just they're so small that they're they might as well. No. It's Invisible seeds give donald the invisible seeds. We like that visual of the vegetables growing out of his hardwood floors, Yeah. Well, again, you have remember Carl Barks just coming off his story ideas at the animation studio. So he he he wrote this like occurred too. And and this easily could have Inducks cartoon to and as you said. In fact, Carl Barks would take... Because we're so few panels in in these

125
00:16:53,174 --> 00:17:08,020
three row comics. There's three rows here. Right. And there are ten pages. He would take each panel and put them up on the wall of his home as a story board. Like the motion like the movies. And he would replace them and move them around and them, and that's how he

126
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:10,670
saw it because that's what he was trained to do at Disney.

127
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:19,855
I thought that was fabulous because it it has the feel of that cartoon. But when he turned the story and, they loved it. No edits. I mean, it was... You sold us mister Barks.

128
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:25,050
Yeah. And and this was, like, so crucial for him. Right? This was, like showing

129
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,985
showing that he can do this

130
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:45,404
mostly on his own. Now I'm I'm... I have no doubt they trusted his story writing, but they're like, we got this existing story. Let's see what you can do with it art wise. I I like that element where we see the little chrome language. This is something we don't get to too much of. Right? We're Right?

131
00:17:45,782 --> 00:17:50,391
We covered another story pixelated pair where we see translated

132
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:51,787
pair

133
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:58,632
here we seen pros or or Mag or whatever chatter away, like like human characters.

134
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:06,165
Right? Right? Now that makes it so appealing to certainly the audiences that are reading this and gives it an element of fun. And

135
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,645
something else notable

136
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:14,500
in a lot of these is they feel because they're in the early forties. They're gonna feel much more out of time

137
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,426
compared to a lot of his later stories. Like a lot of them will have dated elements,

138
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:23,972
but this one to me, you know, you see those old time football helmets

139
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:25,687
just the very concept

140
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:30,854
of the victory garden. But... But... Yeah, this one feels dated in a way that

141
00:18:31,233 --> 00:19:10,712
that I find very charming. What do you think of his early art his early character design here. Oh, I love it. It the the angry donald and the throwing donald and the the jumping and leap and and shouting donald is classic. It it it has that common element in the very last page of him throwing the bag a seated at the wall. Look at his pose there out of the bat. He's just everything. And then and then the last panel is a classic last shot Inducks cartoon. He's looking right at the camera, every character that's been in the store is in the store in the panel. And the the crow have the last word. I think it's just a beautiful ending to a funny kinda rom, like you said a slaps to ramp and that's what what they were doing here. Yeah. That... That's a good

142
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:17,425
explanation of that end panel. To me, it feels very abrupt. But as you as you point out, it is like a cartoon

143
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:31,928
ending. Loss, bit good stuff. Where let's let's get off to the races warranty because we got we got a lot of story to talk about here. So, you know, we've we we've just covered his very first ten page story that he was interested to do

144
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:37,456
that he was given the chance to adapt we're gonna transition now to the first

145
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:54,125
completely independent story that he did. No no c artist, no written source material, we're gonna get the Rabbit foot which is a Carl Barks joint drawn and and written. And this is a story

146
00:19:54,501 --> 00:20:08,270
about that old trope of the lucky rabbit but, right, the idea that that it's a little luck and a good luck charm and, you know, this is kind of before Remarks is going to have the Nephew.

147
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,825
You know, Barks sparks is gonna make the nephews be what he wants them

148
00:20:12,484 --> 00:20:13,383
Sometimes they're

149
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:14,741
very rational.

150
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,496
But sometimes they're they're very child like in their

151
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:27,412
love for this kind of belief. Right? I I I have belief. I believe in it. It's that sort of, like, when you wish upon a star element

152
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:35,120
that Disney, I think in general really likes. Right? Rewarding the the faith of kids and and pure hard. So

153
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:38,836
this is a story where the kids are gonna present to Donald

154
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:40,315
this token

155
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:50,745
that they just got from an old Indian, which is an old trope that has aged well, but it was a very very common place. If you needed something mystical,

156
00:20:51,880 --> 00:21:04,382
you get it from an old Indian. Back at that time. And Donald is gonna be presented as, like, the very rational foil in this one who doesn't believe in good luck. But but he is going to

157
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:14,613
it. Right? And it's gonna make him act in a very rash way because the the gist of this story is that Donald is gonna set out to prove

158
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:22,409
that their Rabbit foot does not bring them luck. He is gonna let them put themselves in all kinds of situations

159
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:23,807
that are

160
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:24,766
advisable

161
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,178
that are dangerous

162
00:21:26,755 --> 00:21:27,255
that

163
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:30,426
Cps would not approve of. But Right.

164
00:21:31,343 --> 00:21:38,034
But but every time, the Nephews are gonna walk away un unscathed, you know, they they're gonna cross a rick bridge

165
00:21:39,008 --> 00:21:39,508
safely.

166
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,680
And and he's gonna... He's gonna poo it as

167
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:51,090
able to hold up an elephant, and, of course, it's gonna collapse under his way. They're gonna use it at to to get a free ride

168
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:59,759
on a little carnival ride, proving him wrong. And then ultimately, this story is going to come to its conclusion

169
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:06,032
with something that we'll see in one of the donald duck cartoons and escaped Gorilla.

170
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:20,755
Do Do you remember that? I don't know the name of the cartoon, but I do know that there was... Yeah. There wasn't an animated cartoon that feature the gorilla Yeah. And and that and the gorilla in this that that escapes from the zoo is, like

171
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:36,382
terrifying. Right? Like it's it's braun in a very very frightening way as was the one in the cartoon, and I didn't fact check this, but I think that cartoon must have come out first. I believe it did. And and remember, the the whole

172
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,460
cinema

173
00:22:38,038 --> 00:23:01,822
industry was taken over in nineteen thirty three, ten years earlier by king Kong and and you've got this fascination with apes and in right with Tarzan and Movies. So I think Barks just again, just really smart just knew what would attract the viewers and the readers. Yeah. That... That's a really good point. Right? The the country, the world, the pop culture was like, Gorilla crazy.

174
00:23:02,718 --> 00:23:14,458
Mighty Joe Young, son of Khan Joanne Yelp. Yeah. A quick, you know, peru of Google tells me that Mountain G weren't really discovered by the outside world until nineteen o two.

175
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:15,556
Wow.

176
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:18,108
It it really struck the popular

177
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,274
imagination for decades there. So

178
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:26,961
so, anyway, the the boys end up using this Rabbit foot to avoid harm,

179
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,348
and then Donald will get the right idea that he's gonna capture

180
00:23:32,004 --> 00:23:36,652
so subdue this gorilla with the charm of the rabbit foot, the lock of the rabbit foot

181
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:40,002
And and he ignores their warnings that's

182
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:44,450
common during their rabbit foot is actually gonna bring him bad luck

183
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:46,367
and and so

184
00:23:46,946 --> 00:23:50,334
he ends we end this story with him

185
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:51,291
narrowly

186
00:23:51,628 --> 00:23:52,128
escaping

187
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:53,205
being

188
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:55,039
killed by the gorilla

189
00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:57,650
being rescued by some firefighters.

190
00:23:58,224 --> 00:23:58,724
And

191
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:05,266
and and we get a a good old old corporal punishment gag at the end where he's, you know, annoyed at the nephews

192
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,120
threatens to

193
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,120
give him the lick of their lives

194
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,160
and

195
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,400
accidentally

196
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,146
himself bringing the the strap.

197
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:17,882
He burn

198
00:24:18,578 --> 00:24:22,125
himself and ends up in the hospital and a full body cast.

199
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,600
Great story. I I I have the point on

200
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:31,850
a couple of things that I thought of well watching this. I going, wow, this is This is like what, five years,

201
00:24:32,268 --> 00:24:35,640
six years before Glad gander, and and we're

202
00:24:35,978 --> 00:24:38,965
we're playing with that luck theme. And we're having

203
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:47,832
fun with it with the rabbit foot and the three nephews and how determined they are and how their luck if you think about it from the bridge and from the

204
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:54,960
the right at the Al the carnival, it all mirrors the kind of what Gladstone would have. And it must have been a successful

205
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,120
trope to

206
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,700
to have Barks continue that on with the character.

207
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,520
Yeah. Totally, he's

208
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,720
he he's

209
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,254
preoccupied by luck. Even early on.

210
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,710
Mh. I've got a remark again just how, like,

211
00:25:08,948 --> 00:25:10,387
terrifying the gorilla Barks.

212
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:12,445
And lots of panels

213
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,960
that feature of the gorilla close ups.

214
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,460
But I love the panel and this one that where he's imagining

215
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,510
himself being louder as a hero

216
00:25:23,206 --> 00:25:31,138
in the newspaper. Says heroic doctor sad do's Gorilla and the sub adding is not brave just lucky says modest hero.

217
00:25:32,277 --> 00:25:39,905
I love it and look at his eyes in that too. I that's a great panel. On that same page is one of my most the most creative panels and that's where he's

218
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,185
shaking the tree branch, the grill and and donald

219
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:47,925
word balloons match every shake of the limb. I thought that was really clever.

220
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:53,110
Right. Right. Great art in there. You know, I like how we just weren't and talked about

221
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:57,400
our specific favorite panels from that one, because that's gonna be the way to do this.

222
00:25:58,535 --> 00:26:04,015
Did you have any favorites that we should in perspective have highlighted in the Victory garden?

223
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:07,883
Oh, I I think the the Victory Garden...

224
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:15,845
I I'd love... I love the closing panel. I think I'm the Victory garden the second page is probably one of my favorite poses for donald.

225
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:17,885
As he says get out of here use.

226
00:26:18,265 --> 00:26:20,125
I think that's probably one of my favorite

227
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,140
panels and it shows donald bucket is full, frustrated,

228
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,980
angry

229
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,635
twelve. How about you? I I I agree with you. The last one is an easy call.

230
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:34,775
The the one where the nephews used peg him with the slingshot pretty great too.

231
00:26:35,415 --> 00:26:42,679
Yeah. I think the the the artwork is just getting better and better here. And as he's given free independence on the Rabbit foot story,

232
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:43,637
he's...

233
00:26:44,055 --> 00:26:46,450
And I I really get the sense that the Carl Barks

234
00:26:47,222 --> 00:27:02,030
has these stories up here and he's just wanting to tell them. So I really believe in he said in one of these interviews that he never liked working on two stories at the same time. He had to finish one before he began the next one and so I think he was one of these tireless workers.

235
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:08,865
I don't think it was a nine to five job. It was while he was sleeping while he was walking while he was whatever. He came out

236
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:10,785
and he had these ideas

237
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:12,555
Yeah. For sure.

238
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:17,950
Alright. I think we're ready to go on to Salesman Donald.

239
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:24,645
So, Mark, I think a third really important story in this series that we're doing is salesman Donald.

240
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:31,501
From walt Disney Conference and stories number thirty nine and November forty three. I the reason is there many reasons

241
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,813
and yet it's sort of the anti

242
00:27:34,604 --> 00:27:37,181
of the Rapid foot story. And because

243
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,499
we see

244
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:49,445
the boys needing donald now to go do their thing, and the boys are... And and this is really about donald bragging about being the best salesman ever. And he is

245
00:27:50,342 --> 00:27:51,719
greeting the Nephews who

246
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:56,305
whose whole goal here is to raise enough money to buy a

247
00:27:57,082 --> 00:28:01,544
an express wagon, but it's probably just a a a boy's wagon.

248
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:08,660
Yeah. I'm just picturing a classic radio flyer wagon, but I didn't hear go on that. Yeah. So they're out to sell egg beater.

249
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:18,258
And they've they've tried and donaldson. I can do it. I can sell throughout the entire neighborhood. I'll sell out. And so kind of counter to Donald

250
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:24,825
success and luck in the... I mean, it... Where he's always struggling, he really is successful in this story, and he's out

251
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:28,425
selling these egg to the most unlikely

252
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:37,113
people in his neighborhood, and there's some great art here. The Nephews are getting frustrated with his his kind of luck now, you know? And

253
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:42,461
and I love this because there's so many things happening in the story. You you made some really interesting characters

254
00:28:43,374 --> 00:28:45,951
donald persistence. And is joy with his

255
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,925
incredible skill as a salesman is is seeing on almost every page here.

256
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:58,000
Until... You... Something's gotta happen here. And so they get it to the last egg beater and this little shack in their neighborhood where they

257
00:28:58,354 --> 00:28:59,571
They meet this feisty,

258
00:29:00,027 --> 00:29:06,159
hermit, who you don't see right away, but you hear right away and he's kind this Al laughing

259
00:29:06,698 --> 00:29:13,850
little prank is all I can come up with. And and and that's a joy just to watch Donald try to foil him through the door.

260
00:29:14,384 --> 00:29:16,482
And and then, of course, we end up

261
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:19,918
seeing him at the end of the story where Donald

262
00:29:20,576 --> 00:29:22,075
eventually is successful

263
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:28,696
and sells the hermit the egg beater and the hermit it just breaks down, and just says, okay. I'll buy it.

264
00:29:29,455 --> 00:29:32,164
But I had fun doing it. I just think it's a fun

265
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:34,085
one of my early memories,

266
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:35,205
a fun

267
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:37,864
story filled with tons of gigs,

268
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:40,044
lots of great artwork

269
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:43,377
the introduction of quirky characters like the hermit

270
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:49,510
started here So... Yeah. That's that's salesman donald. I think it's just a lot of fun. How about you?

271
00:29:50,444 --> 00:29:52,264
Word I'm I'm so glad

272
00:29:52,644 --> 00:29:56,604
that you picked this one. For for a couple of reasons. Because this was your choice.

273
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:11,915
You know, I asked you to throw in another that you really cared about in this area that we're talking about this forty forty three. Right? Forty three. We're still forty three here. Yep. Yep. And and I wanted to limit this from forty three to forty five.

274
00:30:12,449 --> 00:30:17,238
This is a new experience for me because I had never read this one. Okay.

275
00:30:18,076 --> 00:30:24,200
I think I've read good ninety five percent I was output but I've... I've missed a couple of dozen here and there,

276
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:33,745
but this is my first time. Talking about a story on the podcast that I I read the previous day, and this one was so much fun

277
00:30:34,444 --> 00:30:38,240
and and it's so tight and I I loved the Hermit.

278
00:30:38,854 --> 00:30:49,399
Right? It it's it's the Genesis of these other Goofy characters that Donald gonna try to sell to in, like, land of the tote bulls. Yep. And

279
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,100
at least a couple of others.

280
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,614
Right. It it's it's the idea of trying to sell

281
00:30:55,955 --> 00:31:01,749
a gadget that you don't need to someone like that is is inherently funny. Right.

282
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:06,312
And then the tight setup up he does were donald vows at the very beginning.

283
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:07,650
To sell

284
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:10,100
only to people on his block.

285
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:15,695
Gives him that limitation, right? That sets up why he's gonna be so dogg

286
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:18,855
about trying to sell an an egg beater

287
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:22,306
to to a hermit that just hates people

288
00:31:22,685 --> 00:31:27,680
doesn't cook for himself. I think it references he only eats like roots and herbs or something.

289
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:29,966
I it's a vegetarian, yeah. Mh.

290
00:31:30,604 --> 00:31:31,622
And the...

291
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:37,698
It's it's a good pre procedure to all of the little, like, over the top battles

292
00:31:38,077 --> 00:31:40,854
of will and battles of width

293
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:42,053
that

294
00:31:42,632 --> 00:31:46,324
he's gonna have donald go into against Gladstone

295
00:31:46,444 --> 00:31:48,024
against neighbor Jones.

296
00:31:49,404 --> 00:31:50,884
Sometimes again, Scrooge

297
00:31:51,164 --> 00:32:16,459
and and other people, it's It's like it feels like the the birth of all of those. Gladstone said that because I I agree with that. And I think it's also this battle of of width and will with his nephews. I mean, if you think about it, he's trying to up... One up his Nephews and... Here they've gone through the neighborhood, they need the money. And he goes, I'll sell them to the same people you tried. And mean, he's he's he's childish,

298
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:17,739
but he's also

299
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:29,019
so so confident that he can do this. This is the the download we see grow out of this story here. And we're still in forty three. We're still the same first year. I I love the...

300
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:33,939
I love the discuss that they give him when he like flatter and flirt

301
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,186
but a housewife life at the very beginning of it. Yeah. You love the hard on that page too and his his eyes

302
00:32:40,564 --> 00:32:48,696
lift it up and he goes well, I'm afraid. I you won't be interested in the humble kitchen gadget. I'm selling your hands are too delicate for beating eggs.

303
00:32:49,154 --> 00:32:49,274
Right.

304
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:56,001
Yeah. He's so is I. And and we don't really get... That that's a characterization that he's gonna

305
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:57,572
he's gonna abandon.

306
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:11,419
But... But it's a fun little ben. Yeah. Yeah. Any any other... Any anything else you wanna highlight from this this really really cool early story. I'm so glad that you picked this one. Oh, thanks. And I and I I think one of the early

307
00:33:11,835 --> 00:33:21,884
examples of a repeated art technique that he used here, and he may have used it a few times before which the silhouette well when the boys and he and donald are walking down the street,

308
00:33:23,138 --> 00:33:26,854
and and it's just a it's a great way to break up the art in the story.

309
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:37,364
The little side panels and and just the little just the visual gigs are just great when the hermit shoots ink Al him through the the key hole,

310
00:33:37,824 --> 00:33:38,499
that little

311
00:33:38,878 --> 00:33:43,947
very interesting panel of donald just looking at the camera and looking straight ahead rather,

312
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:55,434
and when he says, that's an insult. You don't see many panels like that. Yeah. It definitely feels like very cartoon influenced. Yep. So I think bark out just Al blast with this one with all the gigs. Definitely.

313
00:33:55,929 --> 00:34:10,201
I've got a... I've gotta mention how great the bit with the different doors is Yeah the rubber door the the the layer of doors to he has all these trick doors that can only have been designed for for this kind of battle.

314
00:34:10,578 --> 00:34:12,809
Right? So and and he kind of

315
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:23,138
gives it away at the end that he's like, annoyed that he lost, but it's the most fun that the hermit ever had. So so he's clearly been waiting for for this kind of

316
00:34:23,754 --> 00:34:29,015
test of of width to come along. What do you think of the Herman? Oh, Oh, he's hilarious.

317
00:34:29,548 --> 00:34:30,048
He

318
00:34:30,743 --> 00:34:33,293
his his wild over the top bush this.

319
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,223
Bark does that with, like, herman in the hermit.

320
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:38,233
In another story.

321
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:48,904
And I didn't know there was a precursor to him. So he... He's he's awesome. He's hilarious. And I think what you like about him would what finds him charming is that he's constantly giggling

322
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:59,444
and he's constantly laughing as if he's just enjoying this and you didn't mind buying the egg peter because he had fun. And to me that just... It just makes the story that much more pleasing and, of course,

323
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:03,158
that they're asking for more money at the end and donald the...

324
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:06,049
Again is after them this time with a with a branch.

325
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:17,079
Oh, yeah sorry if you liked it. Yeah. And and you know, may me think of how much the early in mid twentieth Century did this thing too or, like, queues

326
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:26,299
kids got on the hook for these kind of, like, low grade salesman jobs all the time. Right. Looking through the old dow and gold key,

327
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:31,041
comics, they're all these schemes to get kids to sell seeds

328
00:35:31,658 --> 00:35:32,158
and

329
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:35,307
and and other stuff for prizes, and they inevitably

330
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:40,071
resulted in parents having to buy their stock off them.

331
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:43,523
That's right. Alright. So rolling along,

332
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,355
we are at

333
00:35:46,493 --> 00:35:48,930
my favorite of of the bunch of them,

334
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:52,565
which is the Ducktales the iron pants.

335
00:35:53,178 --> 00:35:53,678
And

336
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:55,949
that this is such a highlight

337
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,658
to me of of his early

338
00:35:59,194 --> 00:36:00,070
Era comics.

339
00:36:00,603 --> 00:36:03,494
I read most of these stories in Glad

340
00:36:04,547 --> 00:36:05,725
comp. Their

341
00:36:06,101 --> 00:36:12,277
their album that collected a bunch of them, and they gave this one the title. It's called the Ducktales the iron pants.

342
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:13,274
They

343
00:36:13,611 --> 00:36:14,590
they put bark

344
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:17,400
great oil. Is the Al oil or A lit though?

345
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:29,738
It it was Al oil first then became Al lit though I have but. I have the small it though. It's a smaller lit though. It's just great with the the Nephew to donald. Oh, yeah. That just just a wonderful

346
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:32,035
image, a wonderful painting.

347
00:36:32,474 --> 00:36:38,302
Of donald attacking the boys snow for it in full suit of armor.

348
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,971
He doesn't get to do a lot of these more gag based

349
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:48,577
oils, you know, A lot of them are more like the adventure or the kind of slice of life duck

350
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:49,456
stories.

351
00:36:50,114 --> 00:36:53,371
I can only think of, like, this and truman officer Donald.

352
00:36:54,325 --> 00:37:07,383
Sure there's a couple others, but this one kinda stands apart. This is such a great great painting and but anyway, the story is is awesome. This is one of the best donald versus the nephews.

353
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:08,916
Ten pages.

354
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:10,671
I I think ever.

355
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:15,310
Despite being from this very, very early period. Right?

356
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:22,408
It has the Nephews playing outside having some good old fashioned hole some snow fun.

357
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:23,327
Donald

358
00:37:23,746 --> 00:37:30,373
decides to walk by them He's clearly good them. He's clearly setting them up. To

359
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:38,147
get in in this kind of battle with them. Because he he's gonna engage in that that trope, which

360
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:42,275
doesn't exist any longer. But I think the idea in the

361
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:51,428
the middle of the twentieth century was that a man wearing a top hat was just begging to have it knocked off by a snowball.

362
00:37:52,284 --> 00:38:03,704
So so Donald ins indicates this big snow war with the nephews by walking by them in a top hat, and he sabotage it. He's

363
00:38:04,045 --> 00:38:08,085
fixed it with an elastic band, and he's stationed a big snowball ball,

364
00:38:08,845 --> 00:38:11,765
which he uses to kevin in, the trench that they're in.

365
00:38:12,698 --> 00:38:18,302
Warren did that... Did that bit remind you un comfortably of of the trench warfare from just a couple

366
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:21,710
years a couple decades or or before this?

367
00:38:22,444 --> 00:38:26,739
I didn't see that. That's an interesting take on it, though with the boys and the trench and getting

368
00:38:27,118 --> 00:38:34,277
bombed if you will. But... Yeah, I mean, we're We're only twenty years away from World war one and I only thought about it this time.

369
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:42,490
Okay. But but the this has escalate. And the nephews used to side they have to answer back. So they're gonna build this cool snow for it.

370
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:47,690
And when Donald comes back, trying the same trick, you know, right

371
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:49,810
which which he should know better

372
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,170
if they

373
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:59,706
escalate things by breaking an egg in his top hat, which which sets him off and he invades their snow for it.

374
00:39:00,544 --> 00:39:03,690
But but they've had all this time to prepare now. And so

375
00:39:04,149 --> 00:39:06,045
they are hitting him with all these

376
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:08,120
great snow tricks

377
00:39:08,777 --> 00:39:24,069
that really fired my imagination as as a kid. You know, I see this little snowball ga gun that they're attacking him with or this little this little rico a bit Or what do you what do you call the little weapon that they use that's

378
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,390
two

379
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:29,289
heavy object objects t to Al align There's a name.

380
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:37,690
Can't know. I don't know what that is. Yeah. We're finding errors. But, you know, they they wrap him with a couple of snowball Barks around

381
00:39:38,228 --> 00:39:41,259
Al line, and they they get him good.

382
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:49,631
And they they realized that they may have over shot. Right? Because he heads into his work shop with a vengeance.

383
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:51,227
And we've got these.

384
00:39:52,163 --> 00:39:55,616
We've got these, like, actions where the nephews are

385
00:39:56,169 --> 00:39:57,748
preparing their defenses,

386
00:39:58,087 --> 00:39:59,685
s up their snow for it.

387
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:04,440
And and then Donald is asked doing some un seen escalating.

388
00:40:04,895 --> 00:40:07,075
And when he finally emerges,

389
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:08,435
it is

390
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:12,835
such an amazing panel worn. He is wearing

391
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:19,330
a suit of armor that he's is black sm up in his workshop. It it... It's

392
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,950
suited for Inducks

393
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:27,649
it's got his bill. He's got... It's... You know, it fits his bill. He's holding a sword

394
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:31,537
and and he comes out ready to invade

395
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:34,174
convey them.

396
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:41,545
And and they're just trying every trick that they've got. To repel him, but because he's armed,

397
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:50,636
they they can't stop him and they they start to throw tools and rocks at him and eventually, he's able to

398
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:53,592
approach their wall and

399
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,510
slice a

400
00:40:55,984 --> 00:41:02,005
and and slice the square out of it with this sword. And I love the

401
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:07,037
word balloon where he is just going so over the top threat be beyond.

402
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:09,074
He calls out,

403
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:12,930
nothing can save you from me. I am un invincible.

404
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,544
I am doom

405
00:41:14,882 --> 00:41:15,382
itself.

406
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:18,579
Okay The... This one is a masterpiece.

407
00:41:19,437 --> 00:41:20,417
They finally

408
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:26,341
resort to a little bit of car tune logic where they they've got this flame through

409
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:27,158
Coke.

410
00:41:27,836 --> 00:41:30,430
A trio of brothers with with the flames are already yes.

411
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:33,699
That they've used to kind of melt and then

412
00:41:34,277 --> 00:41:43,969
solidify the walls of their forte They get one of them gets the bright idea to burrow and the snow behind donald and ultimately heats him. He heats his suit of armor up,

413
00:41:44,745 --> 00:41:49,050
you know? And and do they do manage to heat it up enough to repel him.

414
00:41:49,743 --> 00:41:51,239
And and it concludes

415
00:41:51,735 --> 00:41:52,554
with Donald

416
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,822
tending to his wounds on a large black of ice

417
00:41:56,478 --> 00:41:57,417
as the nephews

418
00:41:57,729 --> 00:42:03,015
getting ready to haul up for the winter and they've they've turned the su armor into

419
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:04,091
a radiator

420
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:05,647
stove and our roast

421
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:07,202
roasting wiener.

422
00:42:08,432 --> 00:42:13,797
Warren, that this is such a great bit of of wish Fulfillment and and

423
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:19,520
Kid Empowerment and Donald versus the nephew use Gladstone stick violence.

424
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:39,556
I I don't mean to... I I've... I'm big here. I'm talking too much about this one, but But this, this is like the story that I was like, oh, I I gotta talk about some of these classic ones because I don't wanna mis talking about the Ducktales the iron pants. I like this story a lot and thank you for

425
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:49,310
for your passion about it. I remember this one as well. Not as well as as salesman donald, but I I I do have the Lit graph

426
00:42:49,807 --> 00:42:58,260
that to me just makes me laugh every time I walk by it in my room and look at it. And just... I just love it. You said it it it's classic dial versus the nephews.

427
00:42:58,715 --> 00:43:02,335
What I really like with Barks is doing here is that first

428
00:43:02,795 --> 00:43:04,235
reveal of the dock Armor,

429
00:43:04,755 --> 00:43:15,222
it it's a out loud panel. I mean, and the Ducktales the armor says very little. He just keeps storming the castle and and it a couple of humorous elements I love.

430
00:43:15,954 --> 00:43:21,021
He not only fashioned this out of the Gem stove company where he got the armor from.

431
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,490
But he put a little plume on his hat

432
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:27,650
arm. I mean, this he went over the top, I mean, it's but

433
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,490
great art, great

434
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:30,330
characterization

435
00:43:31,003 --> 00:43:31,503
invent,

436
00:43:31,961 --> 00:43:37,807
but those panels when he is introduced with the sn all the way through to that declaration

437
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:45,233
of I Al doing itself. He doesn't say much at all, Inducks. I think he just says one little line is he's coming out. He goes, whole Barks,

438
00:43:45,912 --> 00:43:46,572
think it's

439
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:47,531
buff,

440
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:49,262
can stop me now.

441
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:59,048
That's what cracked me up so much about this story. Yeah. Yeah. Well set. And and you're right about that awesome touch where you can see the logo of the stove company

442
00:43:59,586 --> 00:44:06,170
on. That he he's like, turned a boiler or something into it. A little little fore foreshadowing there too to the last panel.

443
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:12,514
Right. And you're right, he's just like this this unstoppable, like, sort of juggernaut or not men

444
00:44:12,892 --> 00:44:13,392
slowly

445
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:14,230
men

446
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:26,963
his way towards them. Yeah. This one's a ton of fun. It looks like we are ready to talk about our last one. So I'm I'm glad to close out this one by talking about matt chemist.

447
00:44:28,018 --> 00:44:29,674
I think this one is really

448
00:44:30,331 --> 00:44:34,619
really interesting and really fun. And I remember reading about it in

449
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:36,109
a

450
00:44:36,447 --> 00:44:42,772
issue that Glad stone put out where they paired it with the sunken and yacht because they both had like these little elements.

451
00:44:43,683 --> 00:44:44,702
Where the...

452
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:59,420
There was a little bit of, like, real life that kinda bleeds it and bled into it. So, you know, I'll let I'll let you summarize the story here, and then I'll kinda talk about the little feature that they've published in that comment on it. Yeah. Yeah. And again,

453
00:45:00,415 --> 00:45:02,355
the... This particular one,

454
00:45:02,695 --> 00:45:07,535
Barks, I believe comes from Walt Disney Comics and stories number forty four.

455
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:11,370
Yep. That's the one. And what I like about this story

456
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,010
and it again, it is a newer one to me, but when I read it,

457
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:22,222
I just love the way again, the Nephews and donald play off each other. Anyway, we see the Nephews and they're they're playing in their

458
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,236
their chemistry set and and donald is really interested in what they're doing.

459
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:38,233
And says, hey, you ought a he he'd take some of the chemicals, and he just says you ought to just add this and they they were they warn him, and they'll be careful. Something horrible could happen it could blow up. And he goes

460
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:49,024
fully. And so he pours it in the cylinder bowl that the chemicals are bubbling in flies up in the air hits not lend head and all of a sudden Donnie has this incredible

461
00:45:49,403 --> 00:45:51,520
transformation into a brilliant chemist.

462
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:57,829
He he looks the same. He's walking kind of days. He's got a huge on bump on his head.

463
00:45:58,847 --> 00:46:03,473
But he starts talking very in very scientific kinda funny terms, and he

464
00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:05,146
says we've got to

465
00:46:05,602 --> 00:46:08,533
got it take me seriously here. I'm gonna talk something.

466
00:46:09,004 --> 00:46:12,197
And he says I'm gonna be the Mighty chemist in the universe.

467
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:13,695
So he creates

468
00:46:14,153 --> 00:46:14,653
this

469
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:21,690
concussion that he proudly announces Inducks might Yeah. Doc is Al explosive chemical that he

470
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:27,132
has it has developed, but it's dangerous. So we have to drive far away from Inducks

471
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:36,010
to if experiment with it. So the boys say well, we just do it here in the backyard. No. No. It's too dangerous so they go out and but they get outside of Inducks berg and they

472
00:46:36,468 --> 00:46:40,717
ideally over a cliff and battle begins dropping these

473
00:46:41,214 --> 00:46:41,714
bottles

474
00:46:42,051 --> 00:46:43,788
of duct mite over this

475
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:52,353
one thousand foot high cliff and says, be careful it'll explode while he does this over and over again at different sizes and nothing happens.

476
00:46:52,832 --> 00:47:01,700
So he goes down to the bottom light to match looks in there, and then it just blows up. But instead of being hurt, he's proud that he has

477
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,260
created this incredible potion

478
00:47:04,694 --> 00:47:05,514
And so

479
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:11,885
they go back off, and they pour a little bit of this in the car for gas and it speeds down the road.

480
00:47:12,778 --> 00:47:24,496
They all say buy cruel world, which is just fun. So after they're they're splash the water from the car that with the with the duct might in it goes into the water Donald is now absolutely

481
00:47:24,992 --> 00:47:32,125
convinced that he can send a rocket to the moon. Well the boys get concerned and they go see a doctor called u... Doctor Uc court a brain expert,

482
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:33,362
and he basically

483
00:47:34,297 --> 00:47:37,604
explains to the doctor that they're worried that this

484
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,753
Ducktales might is going to cause more problems,

485
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:48,370
and then he's built a I ship to fly to the moon. So the doctor just basically gets up says so what, he can't harm any anything there.

486
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:58,845
So they go home, Donald got the rockets chip build. So the boys show up and Donald is already in his rocket, and he's ready to take off and he he wears off

487
00:47:59,185 --> 00:48:10,363
the the boys dry last to stay put but he goes all the way at the space. He goes all the way and he's extremely startled now. And he goes around the moon and he heads right back to her. And he crashes,

488
00:48:10,702 --> 00:48:20,355
leave it or not in his own backyard. And when he is told that he has done this incredible achievement, he doesn't believe it. I think his his his little amnesia is little

489
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:33,417
personality shift to the man the Mad chemist comes back around. And he says, I can't believe It went around the the moon, and everybody's proud of this accomplishment, and they ask him if he could mix up some more duct might. And now it doesn't even know what Ducktales is. Right. So

490
00:48:34,169 --> 00:48:39,056
that's that's the color of the of the story there. Yeah. It's a perfect one... One of those

491
00:48:39,393 --> 00:48:41,807
first sort of etch sketch stories

492
00:48:42,344 --> 00:48:43,562
where there's something

493
00:48:44,195 --> 00:48:47,175
that's like, really over the top, he literally

494
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:48,615
leaves earth

495
00:48:49,395 --> 00:49:04,465
and then Barks is gonna have to kind of reset it back to the status quo. I really like this one. This one stood out to me because it feels like the art... It's it's still very early. But the art feels like it's really starting to mature

496
00:49:04,965 --> 00:49:05,745
by now

497
00:49:06,045 --> 00:49:06,905
in this field

498
00:49:07,285 --> 00:49:08,205
Yeah. I agree.

499
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:14,046
Race to the moon. I mean, there's other stories that come later. That pick up on this great early artwork.

500
00:49:14,445 --> 00:49:19,233
Yeah. And this one, you know, it it's kind of a evo of the fire bug,

501
00:49:19,892 --> 00:49:20,791
which is another

502
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:26,760
kind of early not quite as early, I think but our early ish favorite of mine where he gets some kind of

503
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,020
insult to the head that changes his personality.

504
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,920
But I really like the look that he's given when when he's kind of

505
00:49:35,433 --> 00:49:38,026
in this other guys as the mad chemist.

506
00:49:38,624 --> 00:49:42,593
This one's really cool too that sort of escalation of the action

507
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:47,353
where they're driving out to have ever increasing vacant lots

508
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:50,902
until they just get get out deep into the wilderness.

509
00:49:51,678 --> 00:49:59,426
To to to blow up his weapon. And it's hard not to think for me about the Manhattan project.

510
00:49:59,905 --> 00:50:02,238
Right? This one feels like such an allegory

511
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:04,087
Because

512
00:50:04,504 --> 00:50:08,091
what are we in with this one? Is this nineteen forty four?

513
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:18,491
Where are we in in relationship with So so this one has came out in May of nineteen forty four. That's the date on with wikipedia. And

514
00:50:18,948 --> 00:50:19,448
the

515
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,019
Adam Bah,

516
00:50:21,398 --> 00:50:22,716
I to give giveaway. Well,

517
00:50:23,515 --> 00:50:24,674
but the real one,

518
00:50:25,673 --> 00:50:26,173
fat

519
00:50:28,565 --> 00:50:31,242
that that was detonated in forty five.

520
00:50:31,801 --> 00:50:32,301
So.

521
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,976
But everyone like, this was something that everyone

522
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:40,463
kind of new was going on, but

523
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,132
That there was clearly this race Right, going on. No one

524
00:50:45,884 --> 00:50:51,938
Civilians didn't know the specifics of it. But they had an idea that both sides were working on these

525
00:50:52,556 --> 00:50:53,416
these super

526
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,786
So this was on everyone's mind.

527
00:50:56,642 --> 00:50:58,339
And and there's this like, really

528
00:50:58,717 --> 00:51:00,193
kind of frightening Gladstone

529
00:51:00,632 --> 00:51:09,077
with this one. I thought, no question about it. Yeah. Some evil under tone, I mean, Up and oppenheimer was working on the Adam bomb for us. Is that correct? And yes

530
00:51:09,549 --> 00:51:10,608
Yes. Exactly.

531
00:51:11,225 --> 00:51:17,005
And this one has also this really interesting like, sort of true life

532
00:51:17,544 --> 00:51:20,318
component of it. I don't fully

533
00:51:20,657 --> 00:51:22,713
understand it. But apparently,

534
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:28,115
some of the chemistry work that Barks depicted at the beginning of this

535
00:51:28,692 --> 00:51:36,905
actually was like pretty realistic. And and was was ahead of it time. You can find a couple of articles online about this

536
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:49,573
kind of under the the heading of Donald Inducks accidentally use meth and a comic before it was discovered that the studio got this article from these readers, the scientists

537
00:51:49,912 --> 00:51:51,470
who were also big fans.

538
00:51:52,123 --> 00:51:54,057
Of the dot com that were...

539
00:51:54,514 --> 00:51:56,209
I'll just read read this

540
00:51:56,825 --> 00:51:57,325
verbatim.

541
00:51:57,701 --> 00:51:59,237
Yeah. They got this

542
00:52:00,027 --> 00:52:04,769
letter from a doctorate from Joseph Lambert of the California Institute of Technology.

543
00:52:05,207 --> 00:52:10,755
He he's pointing out a a reference in a technical article called the spin states of carb,

544
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:18,267
and he says that despite the recent extensive interest in meth chemistry much additional study is required.

545
00:52:18,626 --> 00:52:29,740
Among the experiments which have not to our knowledge been carried out as yet. Is one of a most intriguing nature suggested the literature of no less than nineteen years ago,

546
00:52:30,339 --> 00:52:37,504
and the foot in that technical paper directed readers to issue forty four of walt Disney comments and stories.

547
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:43,132
And and he he goes on to say that Donald referenced to c h two

548
00:52:43,629 --> 00:52:46,959
in panel two point one was years ahead of its time

549
00:52:47,695 --> 00:52:50,547
as the existence of that elusive chemical

550
00:52:50,939 --> 00:52:54,556
had not been that chemical intermediate and not been proven

551
00:52:54,895 --> 00:52:58,751
as of nineteen forty four. This is like that very right

552
00:52:59,090 --> 00:52:59,590
academic

553
00:52:59,905 --> 00:53:10,377
language that that scientists or or smaller use when they're kind of being a little bit on the nose a little bit funny. The inclusion of this foot Inducks quite skull early article,

554
00:53:11,393 --> 00:53:19,125
stemmed from the discovery that doctor Got and I sherry mutual and independently Gladstone standing esteem for the Adventures of Donald Inducks.

555
00:53:20,623 --> 00:53:25,616
It love it. It was talk to Gasp Barks who rediscovered this early invention of carb.

556
00:53:26,295 --> 00:53:26,795
So

557
00:53:27,309 --> 00:53:34,900
There's there's a lot of reasons to appreciate this one. I think it's... I do think it's one of the best of the early stories.

558
00:53:35,593 --> 00:53:36,093
But

559
00:53:36,469 --> 00:53:39,081
but I also think that that that little technical

560
00:53:40,015 --> 00:53:40,515
detail

561
00:53:41,091 --> 00:53:50,191
merits highlighting here Oh, that... That's great. That thank you for sharing that. I was unaware of that. But it it shows that Donald Barks popularity is spread across

562
00:53:50,584 --> 00:53:51,524
so many different

563
00:53:52,023 --> 00:53:58,237
generations and different different professions. Right? And I also like the notion that that we're not the only

564
00:53:58,856 --> 00:54:07,370
grown men here who who's still like dot com Right? The this this was several decades ago and these these various team scientists.

565
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:16,065
So I I like that. Any any other comments on this one, the Mad chemist warren, Well, again, it was a newer story for me,

566
00:54:16,445 --> 00:54:17,085
looking at it.

567
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,280
In the issue that I have.

568
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:24,935
I'm just... I'm taken by the artwork and how much more Barks is experimenting with

569
00:54:25,475 --> 00:54:36,701
outside of this world and looking at the moon, what the moon might look like Just so many great little little gigs Yeah. I'm gonna have to dig into this one a little bit more and Yeah. This one's a lot of fun. So

570
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:45,305
warren, I I wanna send size just a little bit. We can kinda wrap things up by by talking about by kinda reflecting on this period,

571
00:54:45,725 --> 00:54:50,838
I love going back and looking at these. I still think they're bark in his most formative

572
00:54:51,297 --> 00:54:55,233
time. I mean, I mean, he's he's be coming the story and artist that he

573
00:54:55,812 --> 00:55:00,245
he's he's good. He's not great yet. But he's he's good and he knows it.

574
00:55:00,585 --> 00:55:16,785
And then, again, I just think it's wonderful. How much freedom the editors gave him to do these Yeah, he's really getting some great confidence from doing these. And Alec, it was kind of... It was really unique what he got to do. Right? Like the the Disney comics,

575
00:55:18,645 --> 00:55:25,234
the Ducktales stories that he was doing them. Right? Like, I don't think there were other creators

576
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:27,366
around this time.

577
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:32,350
Who are being given this opportunity. Am I... Am I right? For the comics?

578
00:55:32,805 --> 00:55:40,497
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. No. He was it. That was it at the time. I I think there we had the different cover artist often they

579
00:55:40,836 --> 00:55:41,336
creditors.

580
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:54,485
Up until issue number thirty one, the Victory Garden. They were reprint newspaper com comic strips and they ran them and they ran out. They they said we're done. We have to do something else in that that desperation to find new content

581
00:55:54,902 --> 00:55:58,396
for this walt Disney comics and stories format this monthly format

582
00:55:58,749 --> 00:56:02,534
This was a great career starter for for Carl Barks

583
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:08,110
because they couldn't reprint any more newspaper strips. He he really was

584
00:56:08,526 --> 00:56:09,505
Disney comics

585
00:56:09,922 --> 00:56:11,298
for for a long to

586
00:56:11,636 --> 00:56:14,107
we had those space for twenty three year career. Yeah.

587
00:56:14,919 --> 00:56:16,737
We had those newspaper classics.

588
00:56:17,594 --> 00:56:24,121
We had the great conference in Mickey Mouse comics that'll be collected over and over the the, like, Al fe

589
00:56:25,354 --> 00:56:30,269
Strips and and others the art tele the the comic strips right.

590
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:34,740
Right. He kept walt Disney's comics and stories going.

591
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,377
He set the templates

592
00:56:36,956 --> 00:56:39,733
the the series, he was writing them

593
00:56:40,311 --> 00:56:50,265
monthly for for so long that it's safe to say that, like... The the comments line wouldn't have likely gone on and become as enduring without him.

594
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,500
Let alone, the Donald Inducks

595
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,400
line, you know, that's gonna get spun off and then uncle sp,

596
00:56:57,894 --> 00:57:00,230
Right, That's gonna become his his own...

597
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:05,475
His own... It it might as well have been called Carl Barks uncle Scrooge.

598
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:23,027
Because it wasn't a monthly title at first. No. I not to begin with and all the four color long form stories. I mean, We know that the greek fit the Victory Garden came in early forty three shortly after finds pirate gold given his break but when did the mondays ring

599
00:57:23,365 --> 00:57:30,651
the next long form story? When was that published? That that was September of forty three. So he gets to do about a half dozen

600
00:57:31,645 --> 00:57:32,585
of the

601
00:57:33,445 --> 00:57:34,585
of the ten pager

602
00:57:35,725 --> 00:57:40,839
before he gets to do. That that one, of course is very significant as his first

603
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:41,758
independent

604
00:57:42,177 --> 00:57:49,010
full length adventure story. Right So Disney had doing the full length stories to to fall into the four color format.

605
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:51,083
To do those, He did these monthly.

606
00:57:51,861 --> 00:57:56,076
Know. He's very productive. He was a busy artist and a busy writer to be given all the freedom

607
00:57:56,429 --> 00:58:05,600
to tell all of these stories that he wanted to tell is a great benefit for the readers and for for you and me. Even even if he himself didn't feel

608
00:58:06,035 --> 00:58:11,175
as free sometimes to tell some of the stories that he liked We we didn't cover

609
00:58:11,555 --> 00:58:21,710
lifeguard days is in this early period. And that's the one where he was forced to to reduce the b of a of a duck bathing beauty character.

610
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:22,910
One of his early

611
00:58:23,304 --> 00:58:25,479
bout of of being censored.

612
00:58:26,414 --> 00:58:37,465
We didn't come figure. It it's a it's a duck. So it's Al Inducks. It's a doc with bo so pretty... It's a little bit disturbing, but ultimately, he did have to, like, flatten

613
00:58:37,964 --> 00:58:39,423
reduce her her chest

614
00:58:39,762 --> 00:58:41,061
to get past the editors.

615
00:58:42,132 --> 00:58:55,620
We didn't get Al about neighbor good neighbors. Right? We got first iteration of, like, neighbor jones, and he he uses a couple different versions of name Jones. Mh. So the... These were never like as a kid

616
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,220
I didn't like these as much

617
00:58:59,253 --> 00:59:02,904
because they felt very primitive. I didn't really have a an

618
00:59:03,242 --> 00:59:03,742
appreciation

619
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:15,350
of his his career arc. And then also, you know, I didn't read them in that kind of order or anything, naturally. I I did I read a bunch of these for the first time

620
00:59:15,705 --> 00:59:19,845
in the Gladstone graphic novel, which was number twenty seven

621
00:59:20,185 --> 00:59:21,325
in that series.

622
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:34,860
So, you know, I didn't inherently appreciate it. I I figured out oh these are his first stories. That's interesting. But they weren't ones that I went back to. I probably only read the Ducktales the iron pants

623
00:59:35,374 --> 00:59:36,991
two or three dozen times

624
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:40,181
compared to some of the stories that I read

625
00:59:40,638 --> 00:59:41,555
scores of times,

626
00:59:42,473 --> 00:59:45,660
which is to say, I do. I do love these stories. But,

627
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:55,155
you know, more as an appreciation of what they say about what where he was in his career at the time. Well. Right. I do wanna mention

628
00:59:55,495 --> 00:59:55,995
where

629
00:59:56,495 --> 01:00:00,055
these stories kind of fall as far as the community.

630
01:00:00,495 --> 01:00:03,790
Right? So Yeah. I I love to check them out on Inducks.

631
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:05,410
And I'm gonna

632
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:10,310
I'm gonna talk about them. Let's talk about them in order of lowest first.

633
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:18,025
So so the victory garden... Right. That this one clock in pretty low. This one has a six point nine

634
01:00:18,445 --> 01:00:19,465
out of ten

635
01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:21,557
which puts it as

636
01:00:22,055 --> 01:00:22,555
number

637
01:00:23,173 --> 01:00:25,150
thirty seven thousand

638
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:28,982
and some. Out of the forty one thousand

639
01:00:29,575 --> 01:00:32,815
some stories. Very low for a Barks story.

640
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:49,284
And and obviously, it wasn't written by by him. In fact, I I forgot to mention this, We don't know who wrote it. Like, we don't know we know that it was handed over to him by the editor, but we don't know who Scrooge it. Correct. Okay Written by anonymous studio hack basically

641
01:00:50,338 --> 01:01:00,705
or or anonymous publishing hack. Like it's it's a fine story, but it's it's very thread there. But that's interesting to me. That seems a little bit unfair when you consider,

642
01:01:01,843 --> 01:01:09,150
you, how significant of a story. But but taken as its own story. Yeah. It's it's not the best. Yeah. And then

643
01:01:09,729 --> 01:01:12,925
next the the next highest one is the rabbit foot.

644
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:18,659
Which jumps up okay. Quite a bit. So we've got a seven point one out of ten good for

645
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:20,093
one thousand

646
01:01:20,645 --> 01:01:38,662
seven hundred and forty fourth out of all forty one at some thousand. That did jump up quite a bit just that six point nine to seven point one. It leaked up quite a bit. Right. And that was his most full original story. So Exactly. Clearly it landed much better in in the community as as a

647
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:40,175
purely Carl Barks

648
01:01:40,695 --> 01:01:43,315
story. Yeah. Good to know. And then

649
01:01:43,695 --> 01:01:52,570
Salesman, Donald is next. That gets a seven point two out of ten. And it's... It's into the top thousand, it's rank nine hundred and seventeen

650
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:54,290
out of forty one something

651
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:59,625
And then we've got the Mad chemist. That one Barks quite highly for

652
01:02:00,565 --> 01:02:03,725
a an old one at seven point five out of ten.

653
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:14,251
Good for three hundred and twenty six. I do think that one might get a little bit inflation just because of the, like, the the the ones that kind of

654
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:27,403
bleed out into the pop culture, people remember them better. So I think they've higher... And I do think it's a very good old story. And and then the dock in the iron pants is the clear winner

655
01:02:28,181 --> 01:02:28,860
at range.

656
01:02:29,434 --> 01:02:34,518
Two hundred and ninety one out of forty one thousand. Some

657
01:02:35,094 --> 01:02:37,366
good for seven point five again, out of ten.

658
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:48,435
I would agree with that one being probably the top story in terms of story. And and and I I might... Personally, I might swap the index ratings for

659
01:02:48,935 --> 01:03:13,922
Salesman donald and the Mad chemistry diet. Wasn't as crazy by the med chemistry. But Again, you're right. I think it captured the imagination of the world at that time and that's that's very fair. I Al I I was really impressed by how good that salesman domino was. I I enjoyed that a lot. I was planning to get read that from. That's I think I think of my favorite of all of them today. Nice. And and I just... I love the Ducktales iron Pants.

660
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:14,978
Oh.

661
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:24,910
So much. I I think he's just you can you can really feel he... I think he's doing what really entertain him in that one because.

662
01:03:25,328 --> 01:03:38,449
It's so over the top. Alright. Well this was fine. Yeah. So much like. I agree. This was great warren. This this this is a lot of fun. It's it's fun to take this neat complimentary group of stories from the same era

663
01:03:39,226 --> 01:03:46,766
get to cover them. I'm I'm not planning to cover any more of the old ones. So this this is gonna be our stand

664
01:03:47,264 --> 01:03:48,182
for all of these.

665
01:03:48,581 --> 01:03:53,171
Thank you so much for for taking the time to appreciate these early Barks.

666
01:03:53,784 --> 01:03:55,459
Always great to revisit these stories.

667
01:03:56,017 --> 01:04:09,806
I love it and looking forward to our next opportunity. Awesome. I I'd love to hear what listeners think about, you know, their their own preference for these stories or if there's one that they really think that we should covered

668
01:04:10,462 --> 01:04:18,161
in this early period. Feel free to reach out at Barks remarks at g gmail dot com or on the Barks remarks, Facebook page.

669
01:04:18,739 --> 01:04:20,296
And until next time.
