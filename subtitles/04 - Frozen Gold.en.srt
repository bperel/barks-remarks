Ryan Bailey. Wanna say hide of people Right? Hello good people. This is Ryan. Your assignment

6
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:59,776
for this episode was reading the Donald Du story frozen gold. I was really

7
00:01:00,273 --> 00:01:13,469
excited to read this one because it had been a very long time. I'm gonna give you a little bit of an overview about this comment, we are gonna be talking as mentioned about frozen gold. This is our fourth full length story.

8
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:16,062
And this one was published. The

9
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:19,139
cover cover date is January nineteen

10
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:20,457
forty five

11
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:25,401
and the disappeared in four color number sixty two,

12
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:31,963
It's twenty four pages long, and this story is one in which donald and the nephews

13
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,533
get talked into

14
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,365
flying a life saving pen

15
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:39,196
to a remote alaskan village

16
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:44,159
and then become embroiled in a Al plot to find prospect

17
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:53,132
hidden cache of gold. Al little, more background. This is weirdly another comment four color sixty two that had two full length

18
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,568
Barks stories.

19
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:59,449
I did take a look at the value range. For this one, if you had the the highest

20
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:00,409
value

21
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:01,648
would be like

22
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:06,203
near mint could be up to six thousand dollars today. And

23
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:10,014
I know during the, like, World war two era comics.

24
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:11,454
Pretty much everybody

25
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:12,735
didn't really know

26
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:14,314
how long economic should be.

27
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:18,709
If you read some marble or dc from that era,

28
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,989
don't be surprised if it's sixty pages

29
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,549
for right your nickel. I wanna make sure you get your

30
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:25,999
worth Exactly. And and this

31
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:34,663
this is... We haven't really talked too much about it, but this specific comic that these were being run for color. Was a really strange series, I think.

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:43,250
Western and publishing or Dell, they put it out as like a one shot thing. And it could've been, like, yogi bear one day, little or,

33
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:59,965
another day, you know, Disney comics, the next So it was very random. So I I think that that's why they did it. Right? Once they had... They knew that they were doing a Donald duck themed comic. They got whatever Barks story they commissioned at that time in there.

34
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:04,265
Pretty quickly, these stories are gonna become popular enough that, you know, they're gonna

35
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:05,465
spin it off

36
00:03:05,898 --> 00:03:09,466
and they're gonna turn in and walt Disney comics and stories.

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:19,291
Eventually, Uncle uncles Prescription and Donald Du will both get their series. But for for a while, this is it. This weird four color thing. So a little bit of background,

38
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:23,418
what was going on at this time in history.

39
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,574
You know, previously, I talked about how we were gonna spend some time

40
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:36,339
during World war two and there wasn't any way of getting around that. But as it turns out, you know, this issue is is actually gonna be our last one

41
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:45,663
where the war is still going concern. So I was a little bit surprised when I saw that. It seems like we've sped through it, but it's just because these were only published every,

42
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:50,713
you know, one or two every year for a while. This month saw Roosevelt

43
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:51,632
fourth

44
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:52,650
inauguration.

45
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,445
This was the month that George, H w and Barbara Bush got married.

46
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:02,506
We had He last public speech

47
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:06,230
and the birth of Act Tom sell it,

48
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:08,565
kind of a hodgepodge project history there.

49
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:11,425
But the big historical

50
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:16,396
context, and, you know, I I the the big sub text and this one is pen.

51
00:04:16,895 --> 00:04:17,874
Right? Because

52
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:20,650
Was still a fairly new discovery.

53
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:24,811
At this point, it's gonna be a very important part of the story.

54
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:29,595
Do you know, Ryan how when Was discovered? I don't.

55
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,990
No. I don't.

56
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,169
Well, I certainly knew without looking at Wikipedia a couple nights ago.

57
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,389
It it was in nineteen

58
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,490
twenty eight.

59
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:40,883
And

60
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:42,280
according to my

61
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,016
memory, not with Wikipedia,

62
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:48,588
medical applications of it start in the early nineteen

63
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:49,426
thirties

64
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:52,874
and it didn't go into large scale production

65
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:54,071
until nineteen

66
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:54,968
forty.

67
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:59,074
And it it didn't become available according with,

68
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:00,489
I mean,

69
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:07,265
my memory, it didn't become available to the general public until March of nineteen forty five.

70
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,199
So a remind this this comment,

71
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,470
the cover date was January nineteen forty five. Technically, that means it was probably hit the stands in December

72
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:24,379
forty four. But we're we're actually literally a couple months out before it even became widely available. So

73
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:28,850
I find that really interesting that, you know, Barks was

74
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:30,526
incorporating

75
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:35,268
current events and this in credible discovery into his comics.

76
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:40,676
So what what this brought to mind for me was the the famous

77
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:43,647
delivery of fur medicine.

78
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,245
To know M alaska.

79
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:49,620
Are you familiar with that story of the Sled dogs, ba and To?

80
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:52,612
No. Tell me about it. Okay. So

81
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:55,928
very famously, this was a huge story

82
00:05:56,427 --> 00:05:56,927
in

83
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:58,445
the twenties

84
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,057
There was a

85
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:05,132
a big deal shipment of life saving theory medicine

86
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:06,864
to the remote

87
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:09,862
city of No in Northern Alaska.

88
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,838
And, you know, captivated the nation at that point,

89
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:15,455
there was when we were

90
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:16,389
probably

91
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:22,229
a middle Scrooge high school, there was a animated movie made about it called Ba.

92
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:31,800
I do remember that. Yeah. You remember it. And then last year on Disney plus, the other sled dog who kinda lived in Ba Chat. Even though he was... I think the lead dog

93
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:40,790
or the main dog, To, they they came out with a live action, movie. I immediately thought that this this story itself sounded like Barks,

94
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:44,080
doing kind of an homage to ba

95
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:44,957
delivery

96
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:47,999
of the Dip theory and detox and

97
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:50,414
could couldn't in help but think of that.

98
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:53,787
My impression of of this setting was

99
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:55,184
Bark wanted

100
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:56,634
a really different

101
00:06:57,053 --> 00:07:00,878
buy them for for this sweat then the last time we were in Egypt,

102
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:02,175
and

103
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:04,065
lots of sand and mum,

104
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:05,739
and he wanted to

105
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,699
contrast that with

106
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,259
the the snowy

107
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,099
Yukon.

108
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:10,919
Yeah.

109
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,634
You know, kind of the way Star Wars has a different

110
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:26,831
climate on every planet you know just to... Right. Differentiate your storytelling. You may be right. In fact, I I read an interview with Barks where he he talked about

111
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:27,947
wanting

112
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:28,823
to

113
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:35,739
before he started a story, he literally did what you're talking about. He sat down and thought. Now where do I want

114
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:45,341
to do a story about and oftentimes he would start from the setting. This one I read in in reference to the net story, which is set in the glaze.

115
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:46,574
But,

116
00:07:47,392 --> 00:07:50,848
yeah, I I can imagine that he decided he wanted to

117
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:52,046
ride about

118
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:53,698
the north and,

119
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:56,687
you know, went from there. A little bit more

120
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:57,661
context.

121
00:07:58,418 --> 00:08:00,672
I liked that the city that they're

122
00:08:01,144 --> 00:08:02,162
delivering the

123
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:05,115
the medicine to is called Point.

124
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,150
It's

125
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:13,110
direct parity of the city in ask called Point bearer,

126
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:16,680
which has a pretty notable distinction. Do you know it by chance?

127
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:22,727
The most northern city in the United States. Look at that. Was that a good guess?

128
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:32,190
It was not. I I knew that as a geography geek as a little kid. And more interestingly, I... When I was job hunting a few years ago,

129
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:33,903
found an opening

130
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:37,899
at the va liaison office, I believe in Barks,

131
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:44,782
and looked into a little bit, they're very proud to have the most the northern most American football field in the world,

132
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:48,412
which is all like sm blue Astro.

133
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:53,025
Because, obviously, nothing alive could, you know, survive

134
00:08:53,685 --> 00:08:55,925
Right. The summers in Barks Alaska.

135
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,920
And did you even call it that blue say you can see it through the the wear. Snow. I imagine.

136
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,200
Yes. That's not awesome bit of

137
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,415
an awesome fact there.

138
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:13,710
Let's see. The the people of the city and the people of Alaska, of course are referred to

139
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,066
as Es,

140
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:19,665
Is an outdated term. We don't really use that.

141
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:26,288
The that area, we would probably be looking at any with tribes

142
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,165
or new depending

143
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:36,251
but and and we'll talk about the depiction. I I Actually like the depiction of the city quite a bit and the people in it.

144
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:42,353
Notable at appearances is in this one. We had the return of a

145
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:45,805
leg keith look alike named Foxy p.

146
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:52,579
And no no real other maiden main characters, a couple of silly one offs like Yukon Joe.

147
00:09:53,274 --> 00:09:55,214
Yeah. But i I can say.

148
00:09:56,114 --> 00:10:03,383
Sitting down to read a Carl Barks comic called frozen gold. I can tell for sure going to have tons of uncle Scrooge in.

149
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,539
I

150
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:08,941
I'm wearing my top hat, the listeners can't tell, but, I mean a coat Ducktales.

151
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:11,934
An excitement in anticipation

152
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:15,594
of all the uncle screws we're going to get in this comic.

153
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:17,054
Now we'll

154
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:17,949
obviously

155
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:21,217
beginning to uncle Scrooge at some point, but

156
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:27,970
I can't remember exactly how many, but literally hasn't been created yet. He doesn't exist at this time.

157
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:31,260
So anyway, without further ado,

158
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,489
the beginning of the story, has donald and the nephews,

159
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:37,209
shoveling

160
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:38,049
snow

161
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:46,434
in the city and being disgusted by. Donald is pricing about how much he hates shoveling the snow.

162
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,488
And the nephews look longing

163
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:52,857
at a plane that appears to be right across

164
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,914
from where they're shut the walk.

165
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:56,613
They

166
00:10:56,952 --> 00:10:59,904
they consider that if they had a plane, they could go south

167
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,235
and escape the winter.

168
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:03,852
And Donald

169
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:11,287
sc that and he says, you know, how could I get a plane like that? I have to trade my house for it.

170
00:11:11,746 --> 00:11:21,211
And then you just kinda see Donald thought process as that goes from a crazy idea to Why not? I'm gonna go ahead and trade my

171
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,170
plain

172
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:25,665
for that to my house for that plane.

173
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:31,368
And so we cut... We cut fifteen minutes later and Donald is

174
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:37,051
signing Inducks contract with a very dis interested looking pilot who's agreed his his terms.

175
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:40,582
This frame fa me. There's a lot happening here.

176
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,369
For one thing, the pilot refers to him as mister Inducks

177
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:49,039
Yeah. But we learned that duck is in fact, Donald Ducktales legal surname

178
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,875
yeah, which I I

179
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:57,024
found surprising that it it is not merely descriptive. It's like finding out that Andre the Giant's last name is the giant.

180
00:11:57,904 --> 00:11:57,984
Yeah.

181
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:05,454
Again, if you're if you're a Barks fan, this is just kinda one of those background facts of life. So I like hearing

182
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:06,992
that that takes you a back.

183
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:09,069
Any other comments on that panel?

184
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:13,144
It's hard to tell from the context which one of them is being sucker

185
00:12:13,604 --> 00:12:14,104
because

186
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:19,295
I would think a plane is worth much more then... I mean, a house is worth much more than a little, you know,

187
00:12:20,054 --> 00:12:22,850
four person kinda assessment looking plain like this. Right.

188
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:27,600
But he thought it would be a fool. Someone would be a fool to take my house

189
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:29,977
in exchange for that beautiful play.

190
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,075
Oh. I I definitely

191
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:36,975
I definitely read it as donald putting himself over a barrel,

192
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,873
you know, letting himself be taking a advantage up because he hates the snow.

193
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:58,681
I know he also trades the house and four used snow shovel that the ones that he and his nephews were using just now. Yeah. And know glad you mention that. Because... Because I almost forgot about that. And I think that's just such a great gag. You know, getting that little dig in how much he hates

194
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:00,410
could that he obviously

195
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:02,123
specified that

196
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:06,205
instead of specifying, you know, the lawn mower that shirley comes with the house.

197
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:09,090
So that that was a nice touch.

198
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:22,846
And obviously, this is just one of those moments where this is edge sketched away in in the next one. There's no continuity with this. It's it's in service of the story. But if you know, that it it pretty efficiently

199
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,399
gets us where we need to go.

200
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:26,579
So

201
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,899
donald boys

202
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,219
get ready

203
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:32,439
to use their plain and head south.

204
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:37,059
And Donald is just preparing to remove the skis

205
00:13:37,436 --> 00:13:40,265
because this... I didn't mention this is a sku playing right now.

206
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:42,255
And

207
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,605
mayor F budget

208
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:51,435
tells him to hold on, he approaches him saying that you've got the only skip playing

209
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:53,069
available in town,

210
00:13:53,526 --> 00:13:55,142
and he's come to

211
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:56,976
gas donald

212
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,109
to do... Take a very dangerous

213
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:00,949
mission,

214
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,769
which Donald immediately declines.

215
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:14,779
But The mayor explains that he has the opportunity to be a hero who can save a village full people from what he calls a fright full Scrooge.

216
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:24,062
And he explains Donald is a open hearing it, and he explains that Donald would be tasked with flying a cargo of pen.

217
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,949
He says to the strict native of

218
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:35,740
and donald butts in before he can finish because obviously Donald has heard the word native.

219
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:42,134
And he's had the association that most Americans Al that time, they're imagining a a brass

220
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,014
fetched

221
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:44,234
roof hot.

222
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:47,424
In the t. Right? And so he

223
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:51,215
he agrees and asks oh, am I going to Mexico

224
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:59,171
and the Mayor revealed? No. It's little further north. He needs to go to a place called Point marrow in Alaska.

225
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:00,946
Yeah. Yeah.

226
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:06,765
I think the kids can learn from this issue not to start out your your appeal with

227
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:08,201
very dangerous

228
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:11,072
that's the first thing he throws out

229
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:12,884
gonna convince this duck

230
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:15,304
by letting him know how dangerous it is.

231
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:19,044
That's right. And and they can also learn to

232
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:21,499
to to let let your

233
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,419
conversational partner finish their sentence before you

234
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:26,799
before you agree,

235
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,153
I also say before I move on that the the panel

236
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:37,145
before they get ready for the flight is one of the great wins

237
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,438
of all time

238
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:40,354
as Donald was just

239
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:46,581
shutter with rev not Huey, agreed to. So then we transition to Donald

240
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:54,267
Donald has come to enjoy the attention that he's getting. He's starting around town in front of newspapers,

241
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:56,225
describing him as a hero.

242
00:15:57,018 --> 00:16:01,429
While he's doing that, we've got a couple of sinister figures in the background,

243
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:05,674
discussing the docs on their mission and they have the opportunity

244
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,907
to hide a package

245
00:16:08,762 --> 00:16:10,437
behind the seats of the plane.

246
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:14,145
The the figures then go to a telegraph office,

247
00:16:14,838 --> 00:16:15,338
and

248
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:18,612
they send a message that reads pete

249
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:20,288
Point

250
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:23,242
Alaska, it is coming on pen

251
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,100
plain,

252
00:16:24,954 --> 00:16:28,534
And I wish I looked up how much each word of a telegraph

253
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:29,534
cost

254
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:30,674
at this time.

255
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:36,584
So we we transitioned them to Donald the nephew getting ready to

256
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:44,450
go to sleep. I imagine the last night in their house or or maybe the first night in the hotel. I don't know. We don't really learn about that.

257
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,467
The nephews have a feeling of fore voting

258
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,545
and Donald says

259
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:52,559
don't don't worry about it. Just go to sleep.

260
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,439
And the next morning,

261
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:56,079
they take off

262
00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:05,447
t by by a crowd. So I was I was impressed at this point in the comic after having seen Donald exceptional nautical skills

263
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,064
in the last couple of issues.

264
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:25,716
To find that he already knows how to fly a keep playing and then, of course, later in the comic we discover, he's not the only one who knows that's his claim. His the small children that he takes care of can also fly this plan. That's right. And they haven't even joined the junior which at this point. So they don't have the guide book available or anything.

265
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:39,004
Yeah. There's there's never really any conversation Barks doesn't go to, you know, any lights to say, you know, Al I learned to fly the plane in the war such such. We just... He knows how to fly. So

266
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:43,699
we get one panel before they are somewhere in Canada.

267
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:50,705
And their wings start pricing up and, you know, this is escalating pretty quick. They have to toss out everything.

268
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:55,988
All of their emergency rashes, they're two suitcases, which they call Al.

269
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,896
Know I've heard the word Al before, but I don't think I've

270
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:07,423
ever heard it accept like, someone trying to sound fancy or old tiny. Yeah. It seems like

271
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:10,300
like a black and white carry grant kind of thing.

272
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,855
So the only thing that they hold on to, of course, is the Pen

273
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:21,137
and one pair, which will definitely come and handy you later. They even throw out the seats

274
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:30,304
which seems to stabilize the plane and that enables them to discover that that contra van package behind the seat.

275
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,404
So Donald is is really efficient here and I think in the sequence, he

276
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:42,649
decides that it's too late to be a bomb and tells them that they'll throw it out. If it's nothing valuable.

277
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:45,104
They see that it's a metal lock Barks,

278
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:49,224
and it's labeled as the property of dyke Joe.

279
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:51,204
Yeah. It's interesting.

280
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:57,930
And from this point in the comic, the Inducks kind of act like they already know Inducks Joe from back home.

281
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:00,245
Yeah. He's clearly

282
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,654
in this in this story, at least he's

283
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:04,469
someone that's well known.

284
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:07,122
Because Donald explains...

285
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:09,076
He's that qui prospect

286
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,966
that lives... Oh, he says he lives on our street.

287
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:17,561
And there's a rumor around four Street. With... Oh, yes. Yes. Our former street.

288
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:24,700
And there's a a rumor that he has a million bucks in gold buried somewhere in Alaska,

289
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:30,709
which, you know, must be like three and a half billion today. Yeah. That's true. That's an insane amount of money

290
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:31,869
forty five.

291
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:35,949
How do you think that really is? Probably, like three to five

292
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:43,588
million, I'm guessing. I don't know. I'll have to look up inflation sometimes. I know that the comic that we're reading costs to dime

293
00:19:44,046 --> 00:19:46,119
So nice I think you mentioned

294
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:51,599
the the last steps so that we were on, that there was some really good, like, efficient storytelling

295
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:53,974
some point where they're kind of d reducing,

296
00:19:54,834 --> 00:20:04,269
you know, what happened with the the mommy and the kidnapping back in the mommy's ring, and I feel like it's very efficient here that the characters don't spin their wheels.

297
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:05,109
Donald

298
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:06,004
says

299
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,238
he he assumes that it's full of legal papers,

300
00:20:09,856 --> 00:20:27,359
and he supposed that some thief, you know, hid it trying to avoid being caught. And I like this because this seems like a pretty reasonable guess and it's actually not that far off than what really happened And I I feel like characters are sometimes kind of will stupid especially

301
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:38,431
in media from from this long ago. So they continue their plain ride north word we see them flying past the background that seems to have the aurora

302
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:39,349
depicted.

303
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:49,895
And when they arrive, they approach a large circle in the snow and the Nephew is very acutely asked if that's the arctic circle.

304
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,606
And he explains, no that's

305
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,539
a guide so that we can land safely.

306
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,619
And, you know, I definitely

307
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:07,728
remember thinking to myself, oh, Barks it's circle. I think I've heard of that. And for a little while after reading this, I did have an idea that's something you could see from the air.

308
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:15,990
And then they soon realized that the village is actually buried under the snow, and they're very happy looking

309
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:23,269
person burst out of the snow and welcomes them to point bureau. Yeah. I like the... I the visuals. When I

310
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:25,265
read this to, some actual kids.

311
00:21:25,683 --> 00:21:28,060
They did not know what the Aurora was, and

312
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:39,069
I think they might not known what the arctic Circle was So, yeah, lots of education happening here. Yeah. I I definitely learned a lot about the north and the arctic from reading the Barks stories.

313
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:45,395
Little inter loop, this is the first of at least three Barks architects set stories.

314
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:54,949
All of which are very well remembered in regarded. He seems to really like like this as a setting. So again, we get some very efficient storytelling

315
00:21:55,504 --> 00:22:01,990
there's never really anything made about them taking the medic... The medicine. They just referenced it being delivered,

316
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:14,243
and then they get to stay overnight in the town's big hotel called the Northern Lights hotel. And on the way, the Nephews point out of roaring sound. The village

317
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:25,581
cautions them that they need to grab one of the many steaks that are sticking out of the grounds and hold on tight because it's a blizzard that's approach and they're not gonna make to the hotel. So

318
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:26,875
the Inducks

319
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,087
several minutes of Al blizzard blowing

320
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:31,961
and then we see

321
00:22:32,274 --> 00:22:33,174
that the

322
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:46,444
short posts that they've been holding on to are actually the top of some posts that look to be about twenty feet tall, more than two stories tall, and the blizzard has blown off the top layer of snow that's

323
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:57,082
hiding the buildings, which all of which are at least two stories tall. Severino good story knows is it's important to have really big steaks early on for your characters.

324
00:22:57,819 --> 00:23:01,150
Oh, man. You're were you were a whole under that. That was awesome.

325
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:07,986
So the Ducktales have to climb a ladder to up into the lobby. They're exhausted so they get ready for bed.

326
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:14,109
And I have to say I really liked the mechanics of this town

327
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:17,309
that's just constantly hit by blizzard

328
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:23,515
and and, you know, going from shallow the deep as a kid, I loved I I definitely

329
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:27,759
imagine what that might feel like. You know, thinking back, I feel like

330
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:36,754
there was more of this in the story, but maybe it just stuck with me that well. I also think it's interesting that at the beginning of the story, it looks like the story is about

331
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:37,814
delivering

332
00:23:38,374 --> 00:23:39,194
To this village,

333
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:42,394
and that part is over. That story is over now on.

334
00:23:42,774 --> 00:23:48,240
Yeah. A few pages in we've delivered the and everyone has been saved from the from the awful scourge.

335
00:23:48,738 --> 00:23:49,238
And

336
00:23:49,736 --> 00:23:52,231
I I feel like a lot of other story retailers would have

337
00:23:52,624 --> 00:23:58,164
had a bunch of hazards, and they're trying so hard to get to this place, but they running the bears, and now they've run into,

338
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:05,936
you know, and anything else, any other number of peril on the way. To try and try and get this important to Mc to its location,

339
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:08,272
but that's not how they do it here.

340
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:17,311
Yeah. I I definitely agree. It's it's kind of unusual that the the big thing that drives the story is really just what gets it started.

341
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,450
So

342
00:24:18,908 --> 00:24:30,674
while donald, and then after you still to sleep, we see a couple of sinister looking figures skull around the plane, and we get a look at the guy who must be peed to Fox,

343
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,805
and he realizes quickly

344
00:24:34,143 --> 00:24:36,689
that the package she's looking for isn't there

345
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:40,914
surmise that it must be with the Inducks and so he goes to the hotels.

346
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:47,570
He goes to switch their room. Because he talks in in the best kind of goo speak.

347
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:50,347
All of the... People brother learned that in pitt.

348
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:51,865
Yeah. Exactly.

349
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:54,599
Definitely made to be read alone.

350
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:56,519
So he's ran

351
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:01,059
their room while they sleep. He's not being very careful at all because he wakes up donald.

352
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:01,974
Who

353
00:25:03,032 --> 00:25:03,892
confronts him

354
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:04,731
and

355
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:06,888
this version of Pete

356
00:25:07,427 --> 00:25:09,819
silence is Donald and brings him out

357
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:10,978
to

358
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:12,377
to his accomplish.

359
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:14,015
And so

360
00:25:14,753 --> 00:25:16,651
the the guys like, why'd you bring that

361
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,064
that Inducks?

362
00:25:18,563 --> 00:25:19,063
And

363
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:27,575
he explains that, you know, he saw me, we've gotta get rid of him And the... His his accomplished just pulls out a knife.

364
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:30,563
Ready to slit this throat right there.

365
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:34,151
Again, I I love the the pal

366
00:25:34,687 --> 00:25:36,264
danger that the

367
00:25:36,721 --> 00:25:38,871
the comments from this era,

368
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:41,703
put characters like Donald and Nikki

369
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:48,509
and so on in yeah. I thought that frame in particular was pretty dark. He's just got the knife out and is

370
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:52,989
just ready to ready to get him like a fish. Yeah. And

371
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:55,284
so pete is

372
00:25:55,624 --> 00:26:08,459
he explains no, you know, the the constable, we don't want constable to trace the crime to us. So his plan is to turn him Al loose to to Toy loose about thirty miles out of town,

373
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,714
and the cold gonna be what kills him. And so they load him on a sled and

374
00:26:15,214 --> 00:26:17,674
while he's... When they get out of town, they open

375
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:18,888
the

376
00:26:19,305 --> 00:26:22,279
the lock laptops and they have found

377
00:26:22,697 --> 00:26:25,644
hyundai Joe's map to his gold claim

378
00:26:26,104 --> 00:26:31,378
and they quickly referenced that, oh, the gold cash is buried under under Ducktales,

379
00:26:32,696 --> 00:26:41,490
which is why no one's found it. Is that like where where the the gold s, like, let's the dirt that you've already pan out? Do you remember that?

380
00:26:42,264 --> 00:26:44,562
Yeah. It's it's basically the the worthless leftovers

381
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:51,486
the garbage and and junk. So it it'll have other kinds of rocks and worthless metals and whatever talk you use

382
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:53,258
right to lead you know,

383
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:59,194
dissolve the the dirt or whatever. Yeah. Hide it under the tailing. That's that's

384
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:00,711
what to do.

385
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:01,827
Also,

386
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:08,305
speaking of a million dollars in gold, the Internet says that's worth about fourteen point seven mill today. Nice.

387
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:13,568
Even at, like today's crazy price of gold, is like a mountain of gold. That's like.

388
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:16,441
Alright. So they're mushroom

389
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:18,847
on their way on dogs sled

390
00:27:19,224 --> 00:27:21,757
towards the gold until they come to

391
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:24,626
Al plane that has a loan tree

392
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:26,775
which is what they tie him to.

393
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:27,914
And

394
00:27:28,611 --> 00:27:33,840
Donald is thinking to himself, oh, you know, he he really hasn't tied these ropes very well.

395
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,390
This this version of Pete,

396
00:27:37,086 --> 00:27:44,705
definitely fa. He's he's like, yeah, that's what I want you to do. I want you to get loose, and I want you to die of exposure.

397
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,661
And so he leaves

398
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:47,579
donald

399
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:49,634
to to the cold,

400
00:27:50,272 --> 00:27:51,784
and Donald is

401
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:53,144
starting to get

402
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:58,799
starting to remove the ropes when the telltale roar another blizzard comes up

403
00:27:59,697 --> 00:28:05,120
And Donald despair that it's gonna erase pete's tracks so he can't track him down.

404
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:15,575
He has also gotten turned around this tree so much and of course, the lizard in trying to get loose that he's not confident about which way to go.

405
00:28:16,148 --> 00:28:17,922
So he sets off,

406
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:18,799
and

407
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:22,481
we the reader can immediately see that he's going the wrong way.

408
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:25,714
And he's plotting on

409
00:28:26,014 --> 00:28:27,114
for miles

410
00:28:28,214 --> 00:28:29,234
when he

411
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:32,408
realizes that he's come to a cr traverse that he doesn't

412
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:33,446
recognize

413
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:35,800
and needs to turn around.

414
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,117
But then

415
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:40,070
the Al bridge over the Cr

416
00:28:41,062 --> 00:28:41,562
collapse

417
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,158
sending him down

418
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:48,866
So he's down down in this chasm, and another blizzard comes up and

419
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:50,398
he gets buried

420
00:28:50,817 --> 00:28:52,076
deep in the Cr.

421
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:53,754
And manages

422
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:54,793
to

423
00:28:55,731 --> 00:28:57,390
emerge from the snow

424
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:02,404
But at this point, he doesn't see his train. He doesn't see the hills.

425
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:06,604
And he comments that everything looks kinda misty.

426
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:07,699
And

427
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:19,302
he he gets off a good one before he takes off that, you know, at least he's not lost. He knows he's still somewhere in the lot. Stuff, which great line technically true.

428
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:29,189
So we get a kind of a meanwhile at this point, the nephews may... Wake camp up in the hotel, and they realized that their uncle

429
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:30,626
is gone.

430
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:31,783
And

431
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:33,079
so is the box.

432
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:34,791
So they immediately

433
00:29:35,726 --> 00:29:38,739
know that something's gone wrong and they need the police

434
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:41,211
So they they go to see the

435
00:29:41,828 --> 00:29:42,687
hotel clerk

436
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,557
and say that their uncle been kidnapped.

437
00:29:47,155 --> 00:29:48,894
You know, the town is

438
00:29:49,592 --> 00:29:52,469
responsive. They send out a bunch of slide dog teams,

439
00:29:53,322 --> 00:29:55,237
to to comb the snow.

440
00:29:55,955 --> 00:29:56,455
And

441
00:29:56,832 --> 00:30:01,759
the nephew is like, well, we've got a plain you know, let's go ahead and take that

442
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,249
to find them

443
00:30:03,788 --> 00:30:04,288
And

444
00:30:05,785 --> 00:30:08,602
before they can take off the constable

445
00:30:10,753 --> 00:30:20,085
correctly points out, you're you're just little boys. You can't go off and fly the plane, and he locks them in their hotel room for their own good.

446
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:22,854
I'm glad there's a responsible adult around. Okay.

447
00:30:23,892 --> 00:30:25,448
Try and save these small boys.

448
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:29,480
And so we cut back to Donald when they've been locked in.

449
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:30,673
And

450
00:30:31,328 --> 00:30:33,302
we we learned that

451
00:30:34,156 --> 00:30:36,687
Donald has become snow blind

452
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,291
he doesn't realize this. He just thinks it's gotten dark. But he's

453
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:45,920
he's walking and brought daylight his eyes wide open and holding out his hands

454
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:47,253
I I always

455
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:52,426
knew of snow blindness is like the sun bouncing off the snow. Right?

456
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:56,015
Yeah. That's how I think of it. That was probably the cause.

457
00:30:56,393 --> 00:31:00,643
Yeah. It also provides a good framework for some mister Mcgee style, headaches.

458
00:31:01,714 --> 00:31:07,147
Yeah. And I really like the sequence here. Do you wanna describe this sequence for us?

459
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:12,249
He's glad that there are no lakes or things to fall into as he approaches is

460
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:16,033
some kind of ford full of arctic water surrounded by.

461
00:31:17,262 --> 00:31:18,898
He can hear the ice crunching together,

462
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:27,935
but the ice flows happen to close up just before he falls into the water and he walks on to the next flow. And then as he's about to step off another ice flow into the ocean,

463
00:31:28,894 --> 00:31:33,330
he steps on to a walrus that leads into another wall that leads into an another ice flow.

464
00:31:34,264 --> 00:31:36,322
And he can he can hear something breathing

465
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:38,240
as he surrounded by Walrus.

466
00:31:39,258 --> 00:31:43,489
But he knows that it... It's nice to know that there's no animals that live in his latitude. It's nothing could live

467
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:45,667
way up here where it's so cold.

468
00:31:46,626 --> 00:31:54,134
Right. And I like here is description of this is like a mister Sequence ones. That's that's pretty very that's exactly what it is.

469
00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:56,154
And it's a nice, like,

470
00:31:57,274 --> 00:32:00,789
screw ball moment, but it I think it's also just a fun

471
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:04,029
sequence where Barks got to

472
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:15,558
try try out a little bit of different. Or we're throwing some wildlife life throwing some very ring. And then we're gonna cut back to the kids that are escaping from the hotel out the back. And

473
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:24,308
while they warm up the plane, they acknowledge that they don't have a lot of gas in the tank and they don't have the time to fill it. And I found that very stressful.

474
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:39,502
A small playing with limited gas and frozen and wastes. Yeah. They had to... They cut the sn ropes because they don't have time to warm up the motor. And I'll assume that any experience world the war two pilot perfectly understands what that... What those sentences mean.

475
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:41,659
I do not. Yeah.

476
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:47,854
So we cut back to Donald who is still blu his way through the arctic waist,

477
00:32:48,474 --> 00:32:53,839
and he bumps into an igloo and calls out to whoever might be inside.

478
00:32:54,596 --> 00:32:55,096
And

479
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:59,374
oh, he's not getting any answer, so he goes on in and

480
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,249
There is an oc,

481
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:05,673
but clearly, the igloo has been abandoned because it is

482
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,506
occupied by a bear

483
00:33:08,178 --> 00:33:08,678
Donald

484
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,630
is just having a conversation with the oc.

485
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:17,320
And we see the bear. It's really ferocious looking.

486
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:18,633
And

487
00:33:19,051 --> 00:33:20,788
Donald launches into

488
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:23,383
what he thinks his friendly chatter

489
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:31,545
that, you know, through the lens of time, comes off as as pretty patronizing because he thinks this is

490
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:46,250
some, you know, es he says. And when he feels wet what's really the Barks he's talking about. Oh, you're nice for a code. That that would have cost you two hundred bucks in Salt Lake City. I'll give me five dollars for it right here.

491
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:47,945
So the bear

492
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:56,570
gives him a good snack. Donald is okay, but he realized he's gotta to get out of there. Huey, surmise that it's an es dog,

493
00:33:57,107 --> 00:33:57,607
and

494
00:33:57,944 --> 00:34:00,159
he runs knowing that he's being

495
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:00,855
pursued.

496
00:34:01,908 --> 00:34:05,885
And we can see being chased by a bear while the nephews

497
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:06,844
have

498
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:16,568
there in the plane, and they've located that tree that familiar a tree. So they've decided to use that for a mark, and they are gonna circle

499
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:22,032
lighter and wider But if only got enough gas to do that for twenty minutes.

500
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:25,161
After ten minutes of this, they see

501
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:26,556
a lot of walrus

502
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:41,864
and they see that deserted old igloo And when they fly closer for a better look, they notice tracks and the snow. Yeah. I have to say, when they said they only have enough gas for twenty minutes, I thought how far how far are they from the village

503
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:46,590
to that? How many minutes do they need to save to be able to fly all the all way back to

504
00:34:47,009 --> 00:34:48,348
to the northern lights hotel

505
00:34:48,726 --> 00:34:49,965
and some safety?

506
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:53,605
Yeah. Everything about their rescue is very stressful.

507
00:34:54,123 --> 00:35:01,759
So they they've noticed that it's their uncle uncles tracks. Because they're they're fine pretty low. They can see the various tracks as well.

508
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:08,626
And, you know, as they approach him, they're trying to figure out how can they save their uncle,

509
00:35:09,165 --> 00:35:11,263
and this is where that single pair

510
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:16,862
is gonna come in handy. Because they... They're able to secure it to a harness.

511
00:35:17,797 --> 00:35:18,297
And

512
00:35:18,873 --> 00:35:20,609
as donald approaches,

513
00:35:21,598 --> 00:35:27,007
the edge of a cliff that he doesn't realize he's there. He can hear the airplane.

514
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:29,739
He ends up falling off the cliff.

515
00:35:30,313 --> 00:35:34,283
And the nephews are able to capture him in that pair.

516
00:35:34,621 --> 00:35:45,379
This would have been a great thing to see animated I think. It would have. Yeah. They've got the... They've got some kind of tow cable behind the plane, and they have the the parachute tied to it and just catch them like a catch mint.

517
00:35:46,153 --> 00:35:54,955
Right. And Like the expression on the on the Barks as it switches to a halt of the Cliff edge. So the Nephews paula him in and

518
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:57,007
And that's where they figure out

519
00:35:57,426 --> 00:35:58,206
because Donald

520
00:35:58,545 --> 00:36:03,620
wonders how they found them in the dark. And and that's where they figured out that he's gone snow blind.

521
00:36:04,314 --> 00:36:11,834
So they tend to them I don't... I don't know what they're gonna use in their first aid kit but they they do whatever they can for him.

522
00:36:12,647 --> 00:36:13,147
And

523
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:37,959
they're forced to land even though they're not near point marrow because they have a course run out of gas they they've noticed that there's a cabin beyond the ridge so that... That's what they're trying to reach. And fortunately for them, there seems to be a nice roaring fire. There's smoke coming from the Chimney. So they're gonna approach that cabin, and they they explain what a lucky break. I like if he has

524
00:36:38,419 --> 00:36:38,919
some

525
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:44,815
some classic blind guys sunglasses on at this point to signal to everybody that he's blind.

526
00:36:45,532 --> 00:36:46,032
So

527
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:53,129
just near luck it ends up being fox cp p. Who eats them with withdrawn guns.

528
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:56,662
And Donald even though he can't see him, he immediately

529
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,580
recognizes

530
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:09,339
his voice. He holds them at gunpoint and takes them into the cabin where they can see the Barks of gold that these these guys have already dug that one Joe's gold.

531
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,559
So he directs them into a back room,

532
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:19,269
and they are listening into what they plan to do. The hen is, like, you're not gonna toyota them loose again,

533
00:37:19,728 --> 00:37:34,524
but he explains no. Once we get the bolt put in sa, we're gonna burn down the shack. We avoid it down with them in. And, you know, they're are a really rough spot their they're nervous about what's gonna happen. The window is boarded up from the outside.

534
00:37:35,604 --> 00:37:36,984
There isn't seem to be anything.

535
00:37:37,844 --> 00:37:38,644
But then Louis,

536
00:37:39,777 --> 00:37:41,513
takes a look at the chimney

537
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:48,710
The the Nephews figure that they can fit through this very small flu they take out... Take off their coats.

538
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:51,464
And so we cut to them emerging

539
00:37:51,765 --> 00:37:52,825
covered in.

540
00:37:53,765 --> 00:38:10,155
I I really liked that, you know, he he showed them as they would have come out, they didn't come out all clean. They're able to open the window and let donald out and bring them their they find in in Inclined Joe's claim tunnel, they find a bunch of really useful items

541
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:12,071
including a barrel of gasoline

542
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:20,718
as well as a bunch of cables and motor. And that must have been donald old figures that was probably left by some other gang, some other claim jumpers.

543
00:38:21,436 --> 00:38:30,589
And he's got an idea. He direct and nephews used to gas up the plane, and he's gonna be busy doing something with the cable. Yeah. I like that

544
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:39,760
like the last comic we read the the curse of the mommy's ring, donald and the... And the nephews had to say Huey,. And in this one, the the nephews have un.

545
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:41,911
Saved down bacon.

546
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,063
Yeah. If they had stayed

547
00:38:44,918 --> 00:38:45,975
stayed back in duck,

548
00:38:46,512 --> 00:38:50,138
and he had just come to do this mission by himself. He would've stayed in the hotel.

549
00:38:50,757 --> 00:38:52,714
The guy would have carried him off somewhere.

550
00:38:53,354 --> 00:38:56,491
He would've have died in the wilderness probably falling off that cliff.

551
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,070
Right.

552
00:38:57,923 --> 00:39:01,755
Yeah. Definitely if you hadn't what have... You know, these would have killed him. Yeah.

553
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:10,299
So Donald plan, I've gotta say this is awesome. It's genius. And its simplicity to me. He... He just wraps the whole cabin

554
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,420
in the cable

555
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:15,114
multiple times, like thread on a spool. He says

556
00:39:15,574 --> 00:39:19,454
And somehow you managed just to tie nice meat bow on the roof.

557
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:30,309
And he he thanks to himself. Boy, I wish I could see it. I bet looks really pretty. And, you know what, Donald, it does. It looks great. I love this thing.

558
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,891
So the the two Robbers, the two thugs

559
00:39:35,308 --> 00:39:42,489
have finished packing their gold and pee is about to gl but when he opens the door, he realizes that they're gone,

560
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:53,104
and he makes to to just run out that door and there's a a great panel where he... He bounces off the cables that have... And his hen

561
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:56,504
notices the sound of an airplane

562
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:57,519
and

563
00:39:57,859 --> 00:39:58,359
pete

564
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:03,519
realizes that their whole cabin is moving and and we cut to a great panel

565
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:04,519
where

566
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:13,830
donald and the boys have taken off in the plane and they are just towing the whole cabin along behind them. Yeah. I have to say this is not...

567
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,146
This is not

568
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:18,316
profile was all pretty familiar with.

569
00:40:20,174 --> 00:40:20,674
The

570
00:40:21,372 --> 00:40:30,745
wrap up the cabin in cables and then it behind you small play. I was very surprised at this whole age. Yeah. It was great. It made for Al awesome visual.

571
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,816
I thought it was hilarious when he bounced back

572
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:47,074
out of his door because you could totally imagine him. That's not what anyone's expecting. Yeah. Also, they could have... They could have made their escape as soon as they get out of the chimney and found the gasoline. But instead they were like, no. We can we can deliver these criminals to justice.

573
00:40:47,534 --> 00:40:57,900
Yeah. It's it's a two far again, just like with the delivery of the, we don't see the crooks get delivered to justice. It's just kinda referenced off panel.

574
00:40:59,032 --> 00:41:02,145
They kinda near the Donald eyes have gotten better,

575
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:06,356
and they are on the... They're on the plane

576
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:07,889
flying back home

577
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:10,949
where they're agreed to a Hero welcome.

578
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:14,769
The two people that are closest to them are the mayor

579
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:15,784
and

580
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:19,659
Hyundai Joe himself, the mayor is delivering

581
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:22,335
presenting him the key to the city

582
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:30,359
and donald thinks him he's like, okay. But I don't know have time for that. We're about to fly south as soon as contact joke gets is gold.

583
00:41:31,214 --> 00:41:34,214
And claude Joe, are really goofy feel looking filler.

584
00:41:35,214 --> 00:41:41,048
He steps up, and he tells the crowd that he's been so inspired their hero

585
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:48,062
that he wants to do something good with his fortune gold and he says he's gonna spend the whole million

586
00:41:48,574 --> 00:41:49,353
for more

587
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,503
for these brave boys to fly to more sick.

588
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:57,526
And the last panel, the story the mayor is commenting that

589
00:41:58,279 --> 00:42:04,699
What's happened to the duct, they've faint dead away. So a nice a nice little of ga ending to wrap it up

590
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,634
as they clearly are not gonna get to go south

591
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:16,539
anytime soon. It's a tough tough life for heroes. And you know, who knows what they would even want to go home to? I guess they just wanna go with somewhere will warmer down to floor.

592
00:42:17,677 --> 00:42:21,848
Joe also looks like a a fantastic stereotype of a G old prospect.

593
00:42:22,864 --> 00:42:26,493
He... And he's got this kind of wild white beard

594
00:42:26,952 --> 00:42:30,507
and duct teeth and kind of a around hunters cap on.

595
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:32,106
I also have to say,

596
00:42:32,545 --> 00:42:33,184
by this point,

597
00:42:34,158 --> 00:42:35,937
I was anticipating another

598
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:40,171
the deduct go home with untold riches

599
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,130
ending

600
00:42:41,764 --> 00:42:49,376
like we got in the last couple issues. Right. Because I felt like they were leading up to it. We've got a million dollars of gold on the plane with the Ducktales

601
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:50,115
come home.

602
00:42:50,692 --> 00:43:06,447
Colombia Joe happens to be standing there. That all okay They're... You know, they're gonna get it back to contact Joe. That's nice. But maybe he'll be like, hey As a reward, you guys get half of it yeah do a half million gold, new house and new snow shovel to replace the things you traded away for this play. But

603
00:43:06,786 --> 00:43:10,259
nope. He's he's even more of a hero than that. He's gonna

604
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,099
gonna buy fourteen point seven million dollars worth of and and

605
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:19,187
save even more people. That's right. Although, in my wikipedia reading, apparently,

606
00:43:19,525 --> 00:43:21,541
you needed just huge

607
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:26,029
huge amounts of Al. Like, it it really was a miracle

608
00:43:26,529 --> 00:43:27,949
and it helped people

609
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,229
phenomenally. But until they they

610
00:43:31,529 --> 00:43:35,441
mastered the mass production, it was it was so valuable

611
00:43:36,298 --> 00:43:40,351
and important that they would harvest to patients urine

612
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:43,639
so that they could recover as much of as as possible.

613
00:43:43,976 --> 00:43:47,266
So I hope the second hand is was cheaper than the

614
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:48,998
the first pass.

615
00:43:49,476 --> 00:43:50,933
Yeah. That that was

616
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:52,464
the

617
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:58,599
generic what they sold. Yeah. Yeah. That's the cheaper cheaper version. Alright. So

618
00:43:58,978 --> 00:44:00,915
that is frozen gold.

619
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,788
I wanna talk about some reflections

620
00:44:04,126 --> 00:44:05,025
and how

621
00:44:05,402 --> 00:44:10,542
how well this one is regarded And so I mentioned to you last time we met that

622
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:16,617
I'm I'm gonna talk about the ratings on the aggregation site Inducks, which

623
00:44:17,075 --> 00:44:23,920
averages user ratings for all of the Disney comics. So really, it's the best kind of measure of, you know, how

624
00:44:24,514 --> 00:44:26,274
how these are regarded by fans.

625
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:31,514
This one has an index rating of seven point six.

626
00:44:32,274 --> 00:44:37,940
That would rank it as number two hundred and fifty four out of over forty thousand

627
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:38,858
stories

628
00:44:39,236 --> 00:44:39,516
overall,

629
00:44:40,075 --> 00:44:43,583
which puts it in the ninety nine point four

630
00:44:43,999 --> 00:44:44,818
per percentile.

631
00:44:45,355 --> 00:44:55,960
Just a tiny bit higher than the mommy's ring. We'll find that most of these Barks stories are cluster pretty close together. So it's more like ranking the Barks stories

632
00:44:56,817 --> 00:45:11,256
against each other. The lowest one that we've had is the one I did last time with Eric called too many Pets, which is not a very... I mean, it's a Barks story. So it's fine. But that's that's probably for a while, at least, that's probably gonna be

633
00:45:12,114 --> 00:45:18,342
kind of our baseline for his lowest regarded story. That's still in the ninety fifth

634
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:19,261
percentile.

635
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:26,748
I guess it would be the fifth percentile, but higher than ninety five percent of all the disney comic stories.

636
00:45:27,086 --> 00:45:34,070
So so again, you know, this one is our our highest rated so far, but only a little bit more than mommy's ring.

637
00:45:35,242 --> 00:45:50,224
I mentioned that it had been a long time since I read this one. So, you know, I definitely remembered it. Because I read it all the time as a kid. But I had so much distance from it There is a real joy to go back and read this one and remember the different story beats

638
00:45:50,642 --> 00:45:57,929
And, you know, I Probably hadn't read it since I was a teenager. So I I loved reading this. I loved the

639
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,249
again, the danger,

640
00:45:59,909 --> 00:46:00,409
the

641
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:19,769
setting I thought was really great. I definitely liked the city I thought that the way the snow level changed was kinda reminiscent of almost a video game level. You know, I like to imagine I like to think about that. So This one was a real winner for me, and I

642
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,749
I had a lot of fun reading it.

643
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:31,570
What did you think about it this one. Ryan? I liked it a lot. I think I also would have ranked it higher than the mommy's ring. It was a good kind of a simple story, but

644
00:46:31,908 --> 00:46:33,486
still, like a really harrowing

645
00:46:34,238 --> 00:46:36,492
survival kind of element to it of

646
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:41,275
man versus nature or duck versus nature, and then duck versus is also some

647
00:46:41,652 --> 00:46:42,130
lagoon.

648
00:46:42,584 --> 00:46:43,084
Excellent.

649
00:46:44,262 --> 00:46:47,159
The impression I got... I I didn't see a lot of

650
00:46:47,698 --> 00:46:49,056
articles about this one.

651
00:46:49,616 --> 00:47:06,430
Many of these stories have have a lot written about and I see too much. But my impression is that this one is is regard as you would expect based on that rating. You know, it's an early Barks story. So it's showcasing what is style, you know, what what the form is the venture stories are gonna be. But it is

652
00:47:07,247 --> 00:47:08,506
very well regarded

653
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:09,736
classic Barks.

654
00:47:10,774 --> 00:47:13,109
I think that this one holds up

655
00:47:13,726 --> 00:47:18,113
generally really well. You know, we've definitely got some stuff that's pretty dated.

656
00:47:18,572 --> 00:47:20,710
Some archaic treatments of the Est

657
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:22,748
rather in,

658
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:26,720
you know, the way that Donald talks to anything he thinks his es

659
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:27,720
is

660
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:28,979
kinda crunchy,

661
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:39,728
but he does he doesn't... He does say, hey, es, as he's coming around the side of of the... I igloo. He knows what what all of their names are. They're always asking. Yeah. But...

662
00:47:40,306 --> 00:47:50,354
Yeah. And and he does he does actually say the line, oh maybe maybe he's not used to white men. No doubt he's powering and error. So that's definitely very.

663
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:55,634
But on the whole, I think I think Barks depiction of

664
00:47:56,012 --> 00:48:03,065
Point bureau as Menu village was a very nice treatment of it. You know, They they didn't look very

665
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:04,141
native

666
00:48:04,478 --> 00:48:04,978
quotes.

667
00:48:05,595 --> 00:48:06,533
It looks like

668
00:48:07,403 --> 00:48:08,740
modern for the time

669
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:13,045
connected to the world as much they could be. True. I I also

670
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:15,316
give Barks credit for the fact that

671
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:27,607
there was not an Person carrying and error in the igloo. Yes. That as as Donald was walking in there, and saying idiotic things he was also clearly being an actual idiot.

672
00:48:28,582 --> 00:48:29,082
Just,

673
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:41,058
you know, trying to buy the fur code off of the gigantic bear that's in in there with him and and everything. It it was not... He was not the hero in that city. Right. Right. And that's a good point. As far as appearances

674
00:48:41,675 --> 00:48:43,464
and other media or other

675
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:56,952
artwork work. This is not a story that Barks. He didn't do any of his famous oil paintings for this one. So I don't get to share one of those with you. This one to my knowledge has never been referenced

676
00:48:57,449 --> 00:49:00,639
or kind of featured and either the Ducktales series.

677
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:08,624
Identifying this one very educational. I think this one's the most... The the one that I learned the most. Like, I I can remember.

678
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:18,664
Learning a lot when I was Al kid from this specific story. So this this gave me some interest in, you know, arctic life and

679
00:49:19,004 --> 00:49:19,864
some terms

680
00:49:20,364 --> 00:49:30,887
for surrounding the the art ignore. Ryan, did you have a favorite panel that came to mind or any any panels that are kind contenders for your favorite.

681
00:49:31,725 --> 00:49:36,134
Although go with the one I mentioned at the beginning with the fifteen minutes later.

682
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:40,934
So, mister Duck, you're ready to trade your house and lock for four snow shovel in my ear airplane.

683
00:49:42,948 --> 00:49:48,642
Yeah. That's a good good signing the papers. That's how long it takes to to sell a house in Duck

684
00:49:48,982 --> 00:49:50,321
in nineteen forty five.

685
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:51,560
Excellent.

686
00:49:52,152 --> 00:49:59,965
So my favorite panel, there were a couple that I was considering. I I mentioned the one where he's str at the beginning in front of all the newspaper headlines.

687
00:50:00,618 --> 00:50:03,513
But I think my favorite had to be

688
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,947
cabin... The plane hauling the cabin

689
00:50:06,365 --> 00:50:06,865
sequence.

690
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:11,506
The the one where they're they're towing the cabin behind is great,

691
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:13,379
the one where Pete

692
00:50:13,755 --> 00:50:15,291
slams into the

693
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:16,646
the cables

694
00:50:17,237 --> 00:50:22,961
And then the other one, you know what? I'll I'll say that my favorite panel is the pair catch

695
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:26,031
when he jumps off the cliff and the nephews

696
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:35,555
grab and from the size of the there. And yeah. It expands across the whole page. You can really see like the motion of the plane as it goes up and then down

697
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:41,921
swoop down to kind of make the make the catch and then bring back up so that it doesn't land and you can see the baffled

698
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,433
Barks.

699
00:50:43,513 --> 00:50:51,796
Up on the cliff watching... Watching and pull this off. It's a good. It's a good good shot. Yeah. And and then the little bulge of donald in the parish

700
00:50:52,388 --> 00:51:00,963
any final thoughts for frozen goal. No. I I think it's cool. Like, where it's going. I like that it surprises me a couple times. Awesome.

701
00:51:01,381 --> 00:51:07,005
Well, thank you for thank you again for coming back and and enjoying a about comment with me.
