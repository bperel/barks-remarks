2
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:45,164
Alright. This is Barks Sever marino of Barks remarks. And thank you for joining us. I have a returning host,

3
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:51,592
Ryan Bailey, You wanna say hide to good people ryan Hello good people. This is Ryan. Your assignment

4
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:57,941
for this episode was reading the Donald Du story frozen

5
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:59,816
gold. I was really

6
00:01:00,313 --> 00:01:13,664
excited to read this one because it had been a very long time. I'm gonna give you a little bit of an overview about this comic. We're are gonna be talking as mentioned about frozen gold. This is our fourth full length story

7
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:16,062
And this one was published. The

8
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:20,537
cover cover date is January nineteen forty five

9
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:24,785
and the secured in four color number sixty

10
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:33,573
two. It's twenty four pages long, and this story is one in which Donald N and nephews use get talked into

11
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:36,365
flying a life saving pen

12
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:39,196
to a remote Alaskan village

13
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:44,159
and then become embroiled in a a plot to find prospect

14
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:54,528
hidden cache of gold. Little more background. This is weirdly another comment four sixty two that had two full length Barks stories.

15
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:59,449
I did take a look at the value range. For this one, if you had the the highest

16
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:01,648
value would be like

17
00:02:02,027 --> 00:02:10,014
near mint could be up to six thousand dollars today. And... That's I know during the like, World War two era comics,

18
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:11,454
pretty much everybody

19
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:12,775
didn't really know

20
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:14,694
how long a comic should be.

21
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:18,709
If you read some marvel or Dc from that era,

22
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,989
don't be surprised if it's sixty pages

23
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,999
for your nickel. I wanna make sure you get your nickel worth Exactly. And and this

24
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:34,663
this is... We haven't really talked too much about it, but this specific comic that these were being run for color. Was a really strange series, I think.

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:03:00,145
Western publishing or Dell, they put it out as like, a one shot thing. And it could've have been like Yogi bear one day, little fan annie, another day, you know, Disney comics, the next So it was very random. So I I think that that's why they did it. Right? Once they had... They knew that they were doing a Donald duck themed comic. They got whatever bark story they commissioned at that time in there.

26
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:04,265
Pretty quickly, these stories are gonna become popular enough that, you know, they're gonna

27
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:05,365
spin it off.

28
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:09,466
And they're gonna turn it into walt Disney's comics and stories.

29
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,599
Eventually,

30
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:19,331
provision Donald duck will both get their own series. But for for a while, this is it, this weird four color thing. So a little bit of background,

31
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:23,018
what was going on at this time in history.

32
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,654
You know, previously, I talked about how we were gonna spend some time

33
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:36,339
during World War two, and there wasn't any way of getting around that. But as it turns out, you know, this issue is is actually gonna be our last one

34
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:45,663
where the war is still going concern. So I was a little bit surprised when I saw that. It seems like we've sped through it, but it's just because these were only published every,

35
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:50,753
you know, one or two every year for a while. This month's saw Roosevelt

36
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:51,632
fourth

37
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:52,650
inauguration.

38
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,445
This was the month that George, H w and Barbara Bush got married.

39
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:02,546
We had Hitler's last public speech

40
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,190
and the birth of Actor Tom Sell,

41
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:08,525
kind of a huge hodgepodge of history there.

42
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:11,985
But the big historical context

43
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:16,495
and, you know, I I the the big sub in this one is had of.

44
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:20,650
Right? Because Pen panasonic was still a fairly new discovery.

45
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:24,811
At this point, it's gonna be a very important part of the story.

46
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:29,635
Do you know Ryan? How when kind of someone was discovered? I don't.

47
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,990
No. I don't.

48
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,590
Well, I certainly knew without looking at Wikipedia a couple nights ago.

49
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,389
It it was in nineteen

50
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,490
twenty eight.

51
00:04:40,423 --> 00:04:42,320
And according to my

52
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:44,156
memory, not Wikipedia,

53
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:48,588
medical applications of it start in the early nineteen

54
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:49,426
thirties

55
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:52,914
and it didn't go into large scale production

56
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:54,111
until nineteen

57
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:54,888
forty.

58
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:59,714
And it it didn't become available, according pdf.

59
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:00,529
I mean,

60
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:07,345
my memory, it didn't become available to the general public until March of nineteen forty five.

61
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,339
So remind you of this this comic,

62
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,510
the cover date was January nineteen forty five. Technically, that means it was probably hit the stands in December

63
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:24,379
forty four. But we're we're actually literally a couple months out before it even became widely available, So

64
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:28,850
I find that really interesting that, you know, Barks was

65
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:30,247
incorporating

66
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:32,641
current events and this

67
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:35,329
incredible discovery into his comics.

68
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:40,716
So what what this brought to mind for me was the the famous

69
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:43,687
delivery of dip ethereum medicine

70
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,285
to know Alaska.

71
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:49,620
Are you familiar with that story of the sled dogs, ba and to?

72
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:52,612
No. Tell me about it. Okay. So

73
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:55,928
very famously, this was a huge story

74
00:05:56,387 --> 00:05:56,887
in

75
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:58,485
the twenties.

76
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,057
There was a

77
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:05,172
a big deal shipment of life saving D ethereum medicine

78
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:06,864
to the remote

79
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:09,902
city of Known in Northern Alaska.

80
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,838
And you know, it captivated the nation at that point.

81
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:15,455
There was when we were

82
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:16,429
probably

83
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:19,429
middle school high school, there was a

84
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:22,269
animated movie made about it called Bolt.

85
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:31,840
I do remember that. Yeah. You remember it. And then last year on Disney Plus, the other sled dog who kinda lived in Ba shadow. Even though he was I think the lead dog

86
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:40,790
or the main dog to, they they came out with a live action movie, I immediately thought that this this story itself sounded like Barks

87
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:44,160
doing kind of Al homage to ba

88
00:06:44,497 --> 00:06:44,997
delivery

89
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:47,999
of the Dip inferior anti Barks and

90
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,414
could couldn't help but think of that.

91
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:53,827
My impression of of this setting was

92
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,184
Barks want

93
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:56,634
a really different

94
00:06:57,093 --> 00:07:01,059
by them for for this one then the last time we were in Egypt

95
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:02,095
and

96
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,087
lots of sand and mum

97
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,779
and he wanted to

98
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,659
contrast that with

99
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:09,259
the the snowy

100
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,179
Yukon.

101
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,339
Yeah.

102
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,634
You know, kind of the way Star wars has a different

103
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:26,911
climate on every planet, you know, just to Right differentiate your storytelling. You may be right. In fact, I I read an interview with Barks where he he talked about

104
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,987
wanting

105
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:28,943
to...

106
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:35,779
Before he started a story, he literally did what you're talking about. He sat down and thought. Now where do I want

107
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:45,420
to do a story about and oftentimes he would start from the setting. This one I read in in reference to the next story, which is set in the ever gl.

108
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:46,614
But,

109
00:07:47,392 --> 00:07:50,848
yeah, I can imagine that he decided he wanted to

110
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:53,778
write about the north and,

111
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:57,404
you know, went from there. A little bit more context.

112
00:07:58,418 --> 00:08:00,672
I like that the city that they're

113
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:02,162
delivering the

114
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:05,594
the medicine too is called point mer.

115
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,150
It's

116
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:13,190
direct parody of the city and alaska called point barr,

117
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:16,720
which has a pretty notable distinction. Do you know it by chance?

118
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:22,727
The most northern city in the United States. Look at that. Was that a good guess?

119
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:32,270
It was not. I I knew that as a geography geek as a little kid. And more interestingly, I when I was job hunting a few years ago,

120
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:33,903
Found an opening

121
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:37,899
at the Liaison office, I believe in Barks

122
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:42,389
and looked into a little bit. They're very proud to have the most the northern

123
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:44,822
American football field in the world,

124
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:48,550
which is all like sm blue Astro turf.

125
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:53,065
Because obviously, nothing alive could, you know, survive.

126
00:08:53,725 --> 00:09:01,960
Right. The summers in be Alaska, And if you can even recall it that blue say you can see it through the the of Snow. I imagine.

127
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,200
Yes. That's a awesome bit of

128
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,455
an awesome fact there.

129
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:13,710
Let's see. The the people of the city and the people of Alaska of course are referred to

130
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,066
as es,

131
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:19,886
es is an outdated term. We don't really use that.

132
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:27,167
The that area, we would probably be looking at any tribes or

133
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:28,205
depending

134
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:36,410
but and we'll talk about the depiction. I I actually like the depiction of the city quite a bit and the people in it.

135
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:45,845
Notable appearances in this one. We had the return of a peg leg heat lookalike named foxy p.

136
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:52,619
And no no real other maiden name characters a couple of silly one offs like Yukon Joe.

137
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:53,514
Yeah.

138
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:55,214
I can say...

139
00:09:56,114 --> 00:10:03,542
Sitting down to read a carl Barks comic called frozen Gold. I can tell for sure going to have tons of uncle sc in it.

140
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,539
I...

141
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:09,060
I'm wearing my top hat, the listeners can't tell, but I'm in a coat with tails.

142
00:10:10,114 --> 00:10:11,894
An excitement in anticipation

143
00:10:12,874 --> 00:10:15,594
of all the uncle sc we're going to get in this comic.

144
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:17,054
Now we'll

145
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:17,949
obviously

146
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:21,257
beginning to uncle Scrooge at some point, but

147
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:28,050
I can't remember exactly how many, but literally hasn't been created yet. He doesn't exist at this time.

148
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:31,260
So anyway, without further ado,

149
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,596
the beginning of the story

150
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:35,489
has Donald in the nephews

151
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:37,209
shoveling

152
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:38,049
snow

153
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:46,615
in the city and being disgusted by it. Donald is grip about how much he hates shoveling the snow,

154
00:10:47,232 --> 00:10:52,897
and the nephews look longing at a plane that appears to be right across

155
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:55,055
from where they're shoveling the walk.

156
00:10:56,153 --> 00:10:59,983
They they consider that if they had a plane, they could go south

157
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,235
and escaped the winter.

158
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:03,932
And Donald

159
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:11,147
sc Al that and he says, you know, how could I get a plane like that? I have to trade my house for it.

160
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:21,251
And then you just kinda see Donald thought process as that goes from a crazy idea to why not? I'm gonna go ahead and trade my

161
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:22,289
plane

162
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:25,885
for that my house for that plain

163
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:31,328
And so we cut... We cut fifteen minutes later, and Donald is

164
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:37,131
signing the contract with a very dis looking pilot who's agreed to his terms.

165
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:40,582
This frame fa me. There's a lot happening here.

166
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,267
For one thing, the pilot refers to him as mister Ducktales.

167
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:48,260
So we learned that Duck is in fact Donald Ducktales

168
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,039
legal surname

169
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,875
Yeah, which I I

170
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:57,244
found surprising that it it is not merely descriptive. It's like finding out that Andre the giant's last name is the giant.

171
00:11:57,904 --> 00:11:58,404
Yeah.

172
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:05,494
Again, if you're if you're a Barks fan. This is just kinda one of those background facts of life, so I like hearing

173
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:06,952
that that takes you a back.

174
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:09,069
Any other comments on that panel?

175
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:11,184
It's hard to tell from the context,

176
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,144
which one of them is being sucker

177
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:14,144
because

178
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:22,850
I would think a plane is worth much more then... I mean, the house is worth much more than a little, you know, four person kinda assessment looking plane like this. Right.

179
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:27,640
But he thought it would be a fool... So would be a fool to take my house

180
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:30,177
in exchange for that beautiful plane.

181
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:32,075
Oh I I definitely

182
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:34,524
I definitely read it as

183
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:37,156
Donald putting himself over a barrel.

184
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,913
You know, letting himself be taken advantage of because he hates the snow.

185
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:58,580
I know also trades the house and four used snow shovel, that the ones that he and his nephews were using just now. Yeah. And Glad you mention that because... Because I almost forgot about that. And I think that's just such a great gag. You know, getting that little dig in how much he hates.

186
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:00,450
That he obviously

187
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:01,326
specify

188
00:13:01,663 --> 00:13:02,163
that

189
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:06,285
instead of specifying, you know, the lawn mower that shirley comes with the house.

190
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:09,311
So that that was a nice touch.

191
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:20,293
And obviously, this is just one of those moments where this is etch sketched away in in the next one. There's no continuity with this. It's it's in service of the story, but

192
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:22,886
you know, it... It pretty efficiently

193
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,699
gets us where we need to go.

194
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,939
So don boys

195
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,259
get ready

196
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:40,345
to use their plane and head south. And Donald is just preparing to remove the skis because this... I didn't mention this is a sku plane right now.

197
00:13:41,794 --> 00:13:42,294
And

198
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,645
mayor fizz budget

199
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:55,262
tells him to hold on he approaches him saying that you've got the only ski playing available in town. And he's come to

200
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:57,056
donald

201
00:13:57,729 --> 00:14:00,149
to to undertake a very dangerous

202
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:00,889
mission,

203
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,109
which Donald immediately

204
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:03,689
declines.

205
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:14,279
But the mayor explains that he has the opportunity to be a hero who can save a village full of people from what he calls a fright Scrooge.

206
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:18,114
And he explains, Donald is

207
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:24,102
hearing it and he explains that Donald would be tasked with flying a cargo of Pen.

208
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:27,988
He says to the stricken natives of

209
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:35,780
and donald butts in before he can finish because obviously, Donald has heard the word natives.

210
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:40,814
And he's had the association that most Americans at that time, they're imagining

211
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,174
a brass

212
00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:43,094
t

213
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:47,464
roof hut. In the tropics. Right? And so he

214
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:51,215
he agrees and asks, oh Am I going to Mexico

215
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:59,251
and the mayor reveals no. It's little further north. He needs to go to a place called point marrow in Alaska.

216
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:01,105
Yeah. Yeah.

217
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:06,765
I think the kids can learn from this issue not to start out your your appeal with

218
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:08,201
very dangerous.

219
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:11,112
Yeah. That's the first thing he throws out.

220
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:12,884
Gonna convince this duck

221
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:15,404
by letting him know how dangerous it is.

222
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:19,084
That's right. And and they can also learn to

223
00:15:19,464 --> 00:15:21,499
to to let let your

224
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,399
conversational partner finish their sentence before you.

225
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,099
Before you agree,

226
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,233
I also say before I move on that the panel

227
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,145
before they get ready for the flight is one of the great wins

228
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:40,433
of all time as Donald was just

229
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:45,343
shutter with rev know where he's agreed to. So then we transitioned

230
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:46,660
to Donald

231
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:54,267
Donald has come to enjoy the attention that he's getting. He's str around town in front of newspapers,

232
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:56,305
describing him as a hero.

233
00:15:57,058 --> 00:16:01,429
While he's doing that, we've got a couple of sinister figures in the background

234
00:16:02,006 --> 00:16:05,714
discussing the Ducktales their mission and they have the opportunity

235
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,986
to hide a package

236
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,697
behind the seats of the plane.

237
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:14,145
The the figures then go to a telegraph office.

238
00:16:14,838 --> 00:16:15,338
And

239
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:19,269
they send a message that reads pete fox,

240
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:23,242
Point Mer, Alaska, it is coming on Pen

241
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,254
plain

242
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:28,534
And I wish I looked up how much each word of a telegraph

243
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,714
cost at this time.

244
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:36,624
So we we transitioned them to Donald The who's getting ready to

245
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:44,410
go to sleep, I imagine the last night in their house or or maybe the first night in a hotel. I don't know. We don't really learn about that.

246
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,507
The nephews have a feeling of fore voting,

247
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:49,545
and Donald says

248
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:52,559
don't don't worry about it. Just go to sleep.

249
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,479
And the next morning,

250
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:56,159
they take off

251
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:03,809
cheered by by a crowd. So I was I was impressed at this point in the comic after having seen Donald

252
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,487
exceptional nautical skills

253
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,064
in the last couple of issues.

254
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:25,716
To find that he already knows how to fly a key playing and then, of course, later in the comic we discover. He's not the only one, who knows, specialized his plane. His the small children that he takes care of can also apply to display. That's right. And they haven't even joined the junior witch. At this point. So they don't have the guide book available or anything.

255
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:39,044
Yeah. There's there's never really any conversation. Barks doesn't go to, you know, any lines to say, you know, how I learned to fly the plane in the war such as such? It just... He knows how to fly. So

256
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:43,739
we get one panel before they are somewhere in Canada,

257
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:50,705
and their wings start icing up and, you know, this is escalating pretty quick. They have to toss out everything.

258
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:55,988
All of their emergency rations, their suitcases, which they call Al,

259
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,935
know I've heard the word Val before, but I don't think I've

260
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:07,423
ever heard it except, like, someone trying to sound fancy or old time. Yeah. It seems like

261
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:10,300
like a black and white carry grant kind of thing.

262
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,418
So the only thing that they

263
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,855
hold on to, of course is the Pen

264
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:21,177
and one parachute, which will definitely come in handy you later. They even throw the seats,

265
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:28,492
which seems to stabilize the plane and that enables them to discover that that contra

266
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:30,424
package behind the seat.

267
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,444
So Donald is is really efficient here and I think in this sequence. He

268
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:42,670
decides that it's too late to be a bomb and tells them that they'll throw it out if it's nothing valuable

269
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:45,404
they see that it's a metal lock box,

270
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:48,724
and it's labeled as the property of Cli

271
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:49,224
gel.

272
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:51,244
Yeah. It's interesting.

273
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:57,930
And from this point in the comic the ducks kind of act like... They already know Al Joe from back home.

274
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:00,285
Yeah. He's clearly

275
00:19:00,623 --> 00:19:02,654
in this in this story, at least, he's

276
00:19:03,232 --> 00:19:04,729
someone that's well known.

277
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:07,162
Because Donald explains

278
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:09,076
he's that queer prospect

279
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:12,205
that lives... Oh, he says he lives on our street.

280
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:17,982
And there's a rumor around Warmer street. But... Oh, yes. That's our former street.

281
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:24,740
And there's a a rumor that he has a million bucks in gold buried somewhere in Alaska,

282
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:31,909
which, you know, it must be like three and a half billion today. Yeah. That's true. That's an insane amount of money in nineteen forty five.

283
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:35,989
You think that really is probably like three to five

284
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:43,668
million I'm guessing. I don't know. I'll look up inflation sometimes. I know that the comic that we're reading costs a dime.

285
00:19:44,046 --> 00:19:46,159
So nice I think you mentioned

286
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:51,599
the the last step so that we were on that there was some really good, like, efficient storytelling

287
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:53,574
some point where they're kind of,

288
00:19:54,834 --> 00:20:04,269
you know, what happened with the the mummy and the kidnapping back in the mum ring. And I feel like it's very efficient here that the characters don't spin their wheels.

289
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:05,189
Donald

290
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:06,004
says

291
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,278
he he assumes that it's full of legal papers

292
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:13,510
and he suppose that some thief, you know, hit it

293
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:27,359
trying to avoid being caught. And I like this because it seems like a pretty reasonable guess and it's actually not that far off from what really happened. And I I feel like characters are sometimes kind of will fully stupid, especially

294
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:38,471
in media from from this long ago. So they continue their plain ride word we see them flying past the background that seems to have the Aurora

295
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:39,349
depicted.

296
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:49,895
And when they arrived, they approach a large circle in the snow and then Nephew who's very acutely asked if that's the arctic circle.

297
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,606
And he explains no That's

298
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,539
a guide so that we can land safely.

299
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,619
And, you know, I definitely

300
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:07,908
remember thinking to myself. Oh, the arctic could circle. I think I've heard of that. And for a little while after reading this, I did have an idea that something you could see from the air.

301
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,279
And then they soon realized that

302
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:15,990
village is actually buried under the snow and a very happy looking

303
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:23,269
person bursts out of the snow and welcomes them to point marrow. Yeah. I like the... I like the visuals. When I

304
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:25,305
read this to some actual kids,

305
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:27,980
they did not know what the Aurora was, and

306
00:21:28,398 --> 00:21:39,069
I think they might not have known what the Arctic circle was. So yeah, lots of education happening here. Yeah. I I definitely learned a lot about the north and the From reading the Barks stories.

307
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:43,339
Little inter, this is the first of at least

308
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,395
three arctic set stories.

309
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:54,949
All of which are very well remembered and regarded. He seems to really like like this as a setting. So, again, we get some very efficient storytelling

310
00:21:55,504 --> 00:22:01,990
there's never really anything made about them taking the... The medicine. They just referenced it being delivered.

311
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:09,873
And then they get to stay overnight in the towns big hotel called the Northern Lights Hotel. And

312
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:14,243
on the way, the Nephews point out a roaring sounds the village

313
00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:25,621
cautions them that they need to grab one of the many stakes that are sticking out of the ground and hold on tight because it's a blizzard that's approaching, and they're not gonna make to the hotel. So

314
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:27,075
the Ducktales

315
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:32,001
endure several minutes of blizzard blowing, and then we see

316
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:33,174
that the

317
00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:35,934
short posts that they've been holding on

318
00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:46,444
are actually the top of some posts that look to be about twenty feet tall, more than two stories tall. And the blizzard has blown off the top layer of snow that's

319
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:47,404
hiding

320
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:48,962
buildings, which

321
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:57,082
all of which are at least two stories tall. Every good storyteller knows it's important to have really big stakes early on for your characters.

322
00:22:57,819 --> 00:23:01,190
Oh, man. You were a... You were whole mom of that. That was awesome.

323
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:08,066
So the ducks have to climb a ladder up into the lobby. They're exhausted, so they get ready for Bed.

324
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:14,229
And I have to say I really liked the mechanics of this town

325
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:17,349
that's just constantly hit by blizzard

326
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:27,759
and and, you know, going from shallow and deep as a kid. I loved. I I definitely imagined what that might feel like. You know, thinking back. I feel like

327
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:36,754
there was more of this in the story, but maybe it just stuck with me that well. I also think it's interesting that at the beginning of the story, it looks like the story is about

328
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:39,094
delivering pen to this village.

329
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:42,394
And that part is over. That story is over now on.

330
00:23:42,774 --> 00:23:48,280
Yeah. A few pages in delivered the Pen and everyone has been saved from the from the awful scourge

331
00:23:48,698 --> 00:23:49,198
and

332
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:52,231
I I feel like a lot of other storyteller would have

333
00:23:52,624 --> 00:23:58,164
had a bunch of hazards and they're trying so hard to get to this place, but they've run into bears and now they've run into,

334
00:23:58,624 --> 00:24:05,936
you know, and anything else, any other number of peril on the way to try and try and get this important to mc to its location,

335
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:08,453
but that's not how they do it here.

336
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:17,391
Yeah. I I definitely agree. It's it's kind of unusual that the the big thing that drives the story is really just what gets it started.

337
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,490
So

338
00:24:18,948 --> 00:24:30,776
while Donald, M and f you go to sleep, we see a couple of sinister looking figures skull around the plane, and we get a look at the guy who must be pete to fox

339
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:33,805
and he realizes quickly

340
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:36,689
that the package she's looking for is that there

341
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:40,954
surmise that it must be with the ducks. And so he goes to the hotels.

342
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:47,790
He goes to switch their room. Because he talks in in the best kind of goo speak.

343
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:51,905
All of the... People probably they learned that in Pitt boy. Yeah. Exactly.

344
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:54,639
Definitely made to be right aloud.

345
00:24:55,459 --> 00:25:01,019
So he's ran their room while they sleep. He's not being very careful at all because he wakes up Donald.

346
00:25:01,554 --> 00:25:02,054
Who

347
00:25:03,112 --> 00:25:04,731
confronts him and

348
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:06,968
this version of pete,

349
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:09,819
silence is donald and brings him out

350
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:11,098
to

351
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:12,417
to his accomplish.

352
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:14,055
And so

353
00:25:14,753 --> 00:25:16,651
the the guy's, like, why'd did you bring that

354
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,023
that done duck? And

355
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:27,757
he explains that, you know, he saw me so we've got get rid of him. And the... His his accomplished just pulls out a knife

356
00:25:28,268 --> 00:25:30,602
ready to slit this throat right there.

357
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:34,191
Again, I I love the the pal

358
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:35,985
danger that

359
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,871
comments from this era

360
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:41,703
put characters like Donald and Mickey

361
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:48,509
and someone and... Yeah. I thought that frame in particular was pretty dark. He's just got the knife out and it's

362
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:51,329
just ready to ready to get him like a fish.

363
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:52,989
Yeah. And

364
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:53,789
so

365
00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:55,244
pete is

366
00:25:55,664 --> 00:26:06,099
he explains no, you know, the the constable... We don't want the cons to trace the crime to us. So his plan is to turn him loose to to toy them loose

367
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,539
about thirty miles out of town,

368
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:14,714
and the cold is gonna be kills him. And so they load him on a sled. And

369
00:26:15,254 --> 00:26:17,674
while he's when they get out of town, they open

370
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:18,927
the

371
00:26:19,305 --> 00:26:19,965
the lock

372
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:22,359
and they have found

373
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:31,638
con Joe's mapped to his gold claim. And they quickly referenced that, oh, the gold cash is buried under under the tail,

374
00:26:32,696 --> 00:26:41,650
which is why no one's found it. Is that like where where the the gold s, like, lets the dirt that you've already pan out? Do you remember that?

375
00:26:42,264 --> 00:26:44,601
Yeah. It's it's basically the the worthless leftovers

376
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:51,225
the garbage and and junk. So it'll it'll have other kinds of rocks and worthless metals and whatever toxins you use.

377
00:26:52,142 --> 00:26:53,298
Right. To lead, you know,

378
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:59,194
dissolve the the dirt or whatever. Yeah. Hide it under the tailing. That's that's

379
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:00,751
what to do.

380
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:01,827
Also,

381
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:08,305
speaking of a million dollars in gold, the internet says that's worth about fourteen point seven mil today. Nice.

382
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:13,568
Even Al like today's crazy price of gold, it's like a mountain of gold. That's like...

383
00:27:14,544 --> 00:27:18,887
Alright. So they're mush on their way on dogs sled

384
00:27:19,224 --> 00:27:26,996
towards the gold until they come to a plain that has a lone tree. Which is what they tie him to.

385
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:27,993
And

386
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:33,800
Donald is thinking to himself, oh, you know, he he really hasn't tied these ropes very well.

387
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,469
This this version of Pete

388
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:44,745
definitely foxy. He's he's like, yeah, that's what I want you to do. I want you to get loose, and I want you to die of exposure

389
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,701
And so he leaves

390
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:47,659
Donald

391
00:27:48,396 --> 00:27:49,594
to to the cold.

392
00:27:50,232 --> 00:27:51,784
And Donald is

393
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:53,224
starting to get

394
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:58,799
starting to remove the ropes when the telltale roar of another blizzard comes up

395
00:27:59,657 --> 00:28:05,200
And Donald despair that it's gonna erase pete's tracks, so he can't track him down.

396
00:28:05,957 --> 00:28:15,535
He has also gotten turned around this tree so much and the course, of the lizard and trying to get loose that he's not confident about which way to go.

397
00:28:16,188 --> 00:28:18,759
So he sets off and

398
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:22,521
we the reader can immediately see that he's gone the wrong way.

399
00:28:23,894 --> 00:28:27,234
And he's plotting on for miles

400
00:28:28,214 --> 00:28:32,448
when he realizes that he's come to a cr that he doesn't

401
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:33,446
recognize

402
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:35,699
and needs to turn around,

403
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:37,157
but then

404
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:40,084
the little ice bridge over the Cr

405
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:43,238
collapses sending him down

406
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:48,905
So he's down down in this chasm, and another blizzard comes up and

407
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:50,478
he gets buried

408
00:28:50,857 --> 00:28:52,116
deep in the cr

409
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:53,834
and manages

410
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:54,913
to

411
00:28:55,731 --> 00:28:57,430
emerge from the snow

412
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:02,484
But at this point, he doesn't see his train. He doesn't see the hills.

413
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:06,644
And he comments that everything looks kinda of misty.

414
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:07,738
And

415
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:16,094
he he gets off a good one before he takes off that, you know, at least he's not lost. He knows he's still somewhere in Al last,

416
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:20,161
which great line, technically true. Yes.

417
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:29,229
So we get a kind of a meanwhile at this point, the nephews user are may waking up in the hotel, and they realize that their uncle

418
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:30,746
is gone.

419
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:31,863
And

420
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:34,831
so is the box So they immediately

421
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:38,558
know that something's gone wrong and they need the police.

422
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:41,251
So they they go to see the

423
00:29:41,828 --> 00:29:42,727
hotel clerk

424
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,737
and say that their uncle uncles been kidnapped.

425
00:29:47,195 --> 00:29:48,894
You know, the town is

426
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:52,509
responsive. They send out a bunch of sled dog teams.

427
00:29:53,322 --> 00:29:55,418
To to comb the snow

428
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:56,415
and

429
00:29:56,872 --> 00:30:01,838
the nephew like, well, we've got a plane, you know, let's go ahead and take that

430
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:02,689
to find

431
00:30:03,828 --> 00:30:04,328
And

432
00:30:05,825 --> 00:30:08,722
before they can take off the constable

433
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:20,125
correctly points out. You're you're just little boys. You can't go off and fly the plane, and he locks them in their hotel room for their own good.

434
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,495
I'm glad there's a responsible delta around.

435
00:30:23,932 --> 00:30:25,629
Trying and save these small boys.

436
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:29,480
And so we cut back to Donald when they've been locked in.

437
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:30,633
And

438
00:30:31,407 --> 00:30:33,381
we we learned that

439
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:36,767
Donald has become snow blind

440
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,371
he doesn't realize this. He just thinks it's gotten dark, but he's

441
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:45,860
he's walking and broad daylight his eyes wide open and holding out his hands.

442
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:47,253
I I always

443
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:58,768
knew of snow blindness is like the sun bouncing off the snow. Right? Yeah. That's how I think it. That was probably the cause. Yeah. It also provides a good framework for some

444
00:30:59,105 --> 00:31:00,643
mister style hi.

445
00:31:01,714 --> 00:31:07,367
Yeah. And I really like the sequence here. Do you wanna describe this sequence for us?

446
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:12,249
He's glad that there are no lakes or things to fall into as he approaches is

447
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:16,210
some kind of f full of arctic water surrounded by puff.

448
00:31:17,302 --> 00:31:18,898
He can hear the ice crunching together,

449
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:27,895
but the ice flows happen to close up just before he falls into the water, and he walks on to the next flow. And then as he's about to step off another ice flow into the ocean,

450
00:31:28,894 --> 00:31:33,670
he steps onto a walrus that leads him another wall rest that leads into another ice flow

451
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:36,362
and he can he can hear something breathing

452
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:38,280
as he surrounded by Walrus.

453
00:31:39,258 --> 00:31:43,374
But he knows that it it's nice to know that there's no animals that live in these latitude. Nothing could live.

454
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:45,727
Way up here where it's so cold.

455
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:54,134
Right. And I like here is description of this is like a mister Mi negotiate sequence. That's that's pretty that's exactly what it is.

456
00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:56,194
And it's a nice, like,

457
00:31:57,034 --> 00:32:00,789
Scrooge ball moment, but i I think it's also just a fun

458
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:15,558
sequence where Barks got to try try out a little bit of different art we're throwing some wild life throwing some very brain. And then we're gonna cut back to the kids that are escaping from the hotel out the back. And

459
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:24,348
while they warm up the plane they acknowledge that they don't have a lot of gas in the tank and they don't have the time to fill it. And I found that very stressful.

460
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:33,134
A small plain with limited gas and the frozen wastes. Yeah. They had to... They cut the sn ropes because they don't have time to warm up the motor.

461
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:39,802
And I assume that any experience world War two pilot perfectly understands what that what those sentences mean.

462
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:41,819
I do not. Yeah.

463
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:47,854
So we cut back to Donald, who is still blu his way through the arctic wastes,

464
00:32:48,514 --> 00:32:50,774
and he bumps into an

465
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:54,038
and calls out to whoever might be inside.

466
00:32:54,596 --> 00:32:55,096
And

467
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:59,374
oh he's not getting any answer, so he goes on in, and

468
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,249
There is an oc,

469
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:05,673
but clearly, the igloo has been abandoned because it is

470
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:07,559
occupied by a bear

471
00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:08,758
Donald

472
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,670
is just having a conversation with the oc.

473
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:17,320
And we see the bear it's really ferocious looking.

474
00:33:18,093 --> 00:33:18,593
And

475
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:20,748
Donald launches into

476
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,462
what he thinks his friendly chatter

477
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:31,505
that, you know, through the lens of time, comes off as as pretty patronizing. Because he thinks this is

478
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:46,289
some, you know, es he says. And when he feels wet what's really the bear. He's talking about. Oh, you're nice for a code. That that would cost you two hundred bucks in Salt lake city. I'll give you five dollars for it right here.

479
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:48,025
So the bear

480
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:56,549
gives him a good smack. Donald is okay, but he realizes he's gotta get out of there. He surmise that it's an es dog,

481
00:33:57,107 --> 00:33:57,607
and

482
00:33:58,024 --> 00:34:00,855
he runs knowing that he's being pursued.

483
00:34:01,868 --> 00:34:05,925
And we can see him being chased by a bear, while the nephews

484
00:34:06,384 --> 00:34:06,884
have

485
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:16,568
they're in the plane and they've located that tree that familiar tree. So they've decided to use that for a mark and they are gonna circle

486
00:34:17,108 --> 00:34:22,094
wider and wider, but they've only got enough gas to do that for twenty minutes.

487
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:25,202
After ten minutes of this, they see

488
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:26,596
a lot of walrus

489
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:33,630
and they see that deserted old igloo gluten. And when they fly closer for a better look, they notice

490
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:41,864
tracks in the snow. Yeah. I have to say when they said they only have enough gas for twenty minutes. I thought how far how far are they from the village?

491
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,590
Many minutes do they need to save to be able to fly all the way back to

492
00:34:47,009 --> 00:34:49,965
to the Northern Lights hotel and some safety?

493
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:53,747
Yeah. Everything about their rescue is very stressful.

494
00:34:54,123 --> 00:34:54,623
So

495
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,919
they they've noticed that it's their uncle uncles tracks. Because they're they're fine pretty low. They can see the Barks tracks as well.

496
00:35:02,878 --> 00:35:08,666
And, you know, as they approach him, their trying to figure out how can they save their uncle

497
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,302
And this is where that single parachute

498
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:16,942
was gonna come in handy. Because they they're able to secure it to a harness.

499
00:35:17,837 --> 00:35:18,337
And

500
00:35:18,873 --> 00:35:20,649
as Donald approaches

501
00:35:21,598 --> 00:35:27,087
the edge of a cliff that he doesn't realize he's there. He can hear the airplane.

502
00:35:27,944 --> 00:35:34,323
He ends up falling off the cliff, and the nephews are able to capture him in that parachute.

503
00:35:34,661 --> 00:35:45,339
This would have been a great thing to see animated. I think. It would have. Yeah. They've got the... They've got some kind of toe cable behind the plane and they have the the parachute tied to it and just catch them like a catcher or.

504
00:35:46,193 --> 00:35:57,088
Right? And like the expression on the on the bear as it Scrooge to a halt of the cliff edge. So the nephews call him in and And that's where they figure out

505
00:35:57,466 --> 00:36:03,700
because Donald wonders how they found him in the dark. And and that's where they figured out that he's gone snow blind.

506
00:36:04,314 --> 00:36:11,874
So they tend to them. I don't I don't know what they're gonna use in their first aid kits, but they they do whatever they can for him.

507
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:13,107
And

508
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:37,999
they're forced to land even though they're not near point narrow because they have a course run out of gas they they've noticed that there's a cabin beyond the ridge. So that that's what they're trying to reach. And fortunately for them, there seems to be a nice roaring fire. They're smoke coming from the chimney, so they're gonna approach that cabin and they they explain what a lucky brain. I like if he has

509
00:36:38,419 --> 00:36:38,919
some

510
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:45,094
some classic blind guys sunglasses on at this point to signal to everybody that he's blind.

511
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:46,072
So

512
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:53,229
just they're luck it ends up being foxy pete who greet them with drawn guns.

513
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:56,702
And Donald, even though he can't see him. He immediately

514
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,580
recognizes

515
00:36:58,173 --> 00:37:09,059
his voice. He holds them at gunpoint and takes them into the cabin where they can see the Barks of gold that these these guys have already done that Jo.

516
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,819
So he directs them into a back room

517
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:19,309
and they are listening into to what they plan to do. The hen is like, you're not gonna tweet and loose again.

518
00:37:19,768 --> 00:37:34,644
But he explains no once we get the bold put in sa, we're gonna burn down the shack. We're gonna avoid it down with them in it. And, you know, they're in a really rough spot they're they're nervous about what's gonna happen. The window is boarded up from the outside.

519
00:37:35,604 --> 00:37:36,984
There doesn't seem to be anything.

520
00:37:37,844 --> 00:37:38,784
But that Louie

521
00:37:39,777 --> 00:37:41,553
takes a look at the chimney.

522
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:48,710
The the nephews figure that they can fit through this very small flu, they take out... Take off their coats.

523
00:37:49,605 --> 00:37:51,464
And so we cut to them emerging

524
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:53,165
covered in soot.

525
00:37:53,765 --> 00:38:10,155
I I really liked that, you know, he he showed them as they would have come out, they didn't come out all clean. They're able to open the window and let mcdonald out and bring them their they find in in inc Joe's claim tunnel. They find a bunch of really useful items

526
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:20,780
including a barrel of gasoline as well as a bunch of cables motor. And that must have been Donald figures that was probably left by some other gang, some other acclaimed jumpers.

527
00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:30,589
And he's got an idea. He directs and nephews used to gas up the plane and he's gonna be busy doing something with the cable. Yeah. I like that

528
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:39,900
Like the last comic we read the the curse of the mum ring, Donald and the and the Nephews had to say Huey,. And in this one, the nephews have un

529
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:41,911
save donald bacon.

530
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,023
Yeah. If they had stayed,

531
00:38:44,918 --> 00:38:46,015
stayed back in Duck,

532
00:38:46,512 --> 00:38:50,178
and he had just come to do this mission by himself, He would've have stayed in the hotel.

533
00:38:50,757 --> 00:38:52,755
The guy would have carried him off somewhere.

534
00:38:53,354 --> 00:38:56,910
He would have died in the wilderness probably falling off that cliff. Right.

535
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:58,122
Yeah.

536
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:01,834
If you hadn't anyone... you know, these would have killed them. Yeah.

537
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:07,539
So Donald plan, I've gotta say this is Awesome time it's genius and its simplicity.

538
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,299
He he just wraps the whole cabin

539
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,459
in the cable

540
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:14,959
multiple times like thread on a spool. He says,

541
00:39:15,574 --> 00:39:19,674
And somehow he manages just to tie nice neat, ball on the roof.

542
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:21,194
And

543
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:30,309
he he things to himself. Boy, I wish I could see it. I bet it looks really pretty. And, you know what Donald, it does. It looks great. I love this scene.

544
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,931
So the the two robbers, the two thugs

545
00:39:35,308 --> 00:39:53,184
have finished packing their gold and Pete is about to glow but when he opens the door he realizes that they're gone, and he makes to to just run out that door and there's a a great panel where he he bounces off the cables that have and his hen

546
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:56,519
notices the sound of an airplane

547
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:57,479
and

548
00:39:57,899 --> 00:39:58,399
Pete

549
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:03,559
realizes that their whole cabin is moving. And and we cut to a great panel

550
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:04,519
where

551
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:13,830
donald in the boys have taken off in the plane and they are just towing the whole cabin along behind them. Yeah. I have to say this is not...

552
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:18,356
This is not a pro profile was all already familiar with.

553
00:40:20,214 --> 00:40:20,714
The

554
00:40:21,412 --> 00:40:30,785
wrap up the cabin in cables and then it behind your a small plane. I was very surprised at this whole age. Yeah. It was great. It made for an awesome visual.

555
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,675
I thought it was hilarious when he bounced back.

556
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:47,114
Out of his door, because you could totally imagine him, That's not what anyone's expecting. Yeah. And also they could have they could have made their escape as soon as they get out of the chimney and found the gasoline, but instead they were like, no. We can we can deliver these criminals to justice.

557
00:40:47,534 --> 00:40:57,940
Yeah. It's it's a two for. Again, just like with the delivery of the, we don't see the crux get delivered to justice. It's just kinda referenced off panel.

558
00:40:59,072 --> 00:41:02,365
They kinda na the Donald eyes have gotten better

559
00:41:02,783 --> 00:41:06,396
and they are on the... They're on the plane

560
00:41:06,749 --> 00:41:07,929
flying back home

561
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:10,989
where they're greeted to a hero's welcome.

562
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:14,669
The two people that are closest to them are the mayor.

563
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:15,784
And

564
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:19,659
Con Joe himself, the mayor is delivering,

565
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,195
presenting him the key to the city.

566
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:30,519
And Donald thinks and he's like, okay, but I don't have time for that. We're about to fly south as soon as cal jug gets his gold.

567
00:41:31,214 --> 00:41:34,474
And Quan died Joe a really goofy feel looking fella.

568
00:41:35,255 --> 00:41:41,048
He steps up and he tells the crowd that he's been so inspired their hero

569
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:48,102
that he wants to do something good with his fortunate gold. And he says he's gonna spend the whole million

570
00:41:48,614 --> 00:41:52,702
for more panasonic for these brave boys to fly to more sick es.

571
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:55,094
And the last panel of the story,

572
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:57,567
the mayor is commenting that

573
00:41:58,279 --> 00:42:04,699
what's happened to the ducks, they've fainted dead away. So a nice a nice little gag ending to wrap it up

574
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:16,539
as they clearly are not gonna get to go south any anytime soon. It's a tough tough life for heroes. You know, who knows what they would even want to go home too? I guess they just wanna go somewhere warmer down to.

575
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:21,848
Contact Joe also looks like a a fantastic stereotype of a g old prospect.

576
00:42:22,943 --> 00:42:30,648
He and he's got this kind of wild white beard and buck teeth and kind of round hunters cap on.

577
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:32,166
I also have to say

578
00:42:32,545 --> 00:42:33,184
by this point,

579
00:42:34,158 --> 00:42:35,937
I was anticipating another

580
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:40,211
the ducks go home with untold riches

581
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,070
ending,

582
00:42:41,764 --> 00:42:48,364
like we got in the last couple issues. Right. Because I felt like they were leading up to it. We've got a million dollars of gold on the plane with the ducks.

583
00:42:49,257 --> 00:42:50,155
They come home.

584
00:42:50,692 --> 00:42:59,900
Contact Joe happens to be standing there. That oh okay. They're... You know, they're gonna give it back to Al Joe. That's nice. But maybe he'll be like, hey as a reward, you guys get half of it

585
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:06,447
have gold new house and new snow shovel to replace the things you traded away for this plane. But

586
00:43:06,786 --> 00:43:10,299
no. He's he's even more of a hero than that. He's gonna

587
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,139
gonna buy fourteen point seven million dollars worth of pen and

588
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:21,621
save even more people. That's right. Although in my wikipedia reading, apparently, you needed just huge

589
00:43:22,078 --> 00:43:26,069
huge amounts of Al. Like, it it really was a miracle

590
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:27,989
and it helped people

591
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:31,229
phenomenally. But until they they

592
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:35,481
mastered the mass production, it was it was so valuable

593
00:43:36,298 --> 00:43:38,754
and important that they would harvest

594
00:43:39,212 --> 00:43:40,391
patients urine

595
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:47,266
so that they could recover as much of it as possible. So I hope the second hand pen still was cheaper than the

596
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,140
in the first pass.

597
00:43:49,476 --> 00:43:50,933
Yeah. That that was

598
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:52,464
the

599
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,384
generic what they sold.

600
00:43:54,684 --> 00:43:58,599
Yeah. Yeah. That's the cheaper cheaper version. Alright. So

601
00:43:59,058 --> 00:44:00,954
that is frozen gold.

602
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:05,104
I wanna talk about some reflections and how

603
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:10,542
how well this one is regarded And so I mentioned to you last time we met that

604
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:15,059
I'm I'm gonna talk about the ratings on the aggregation site

605
00:44:15,678 --> 00:44:16,577
index, which

606
00:44:17,075 --> 00:44:17,575
averages

607
00:44:17,913 --> 00:44:23,960
user ratings for all of the Disney comics. So really, it's the best kind of measure of, you know, how

608
00:44:24,554 --> 00:44:26,454
how these are regarded by fans.

609
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:31,614
This one has an index rating of seven point six.

610
00:44:32,274 --> 00:44:37,980
That would rank it as number two hundred and fifty four out of over forty thousand

611
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:38,858
stories

612
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:43,622
overall, which puts it in the ninety nine point four

613
00:44:43,999 --> 00:44:44,858
per percentile,

614
00:44:45,355 --> 00:44:55,960
Just a tiny bit higher than the mum ring. We'll find that most of these Barks stories are clustered pretty close together. So it's more like ranking the Barks stories

615
00:44:56,857 --> 00:45:11,296
against each other. The lowest one that we've had is the one I did last time with Eric called too many pets, which is not a very... I mean, it's a Barks story. So it's fine. But that's that's probably for a while at least, that's probably gonna be

616
00:45:12,194 --> 00:45:13,293
kind of our baseline

617
00:45:13,632 --> 00:45:18,382
for his lowest regarded story. That's still on the ninety fifth

618
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:19,261
percentile.

619
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:26,748
I guess it would be the fifth percentile, but higher than ninety five percent of all the Disney comic stories.

620
00:45:27,086 --> 00:45:34,109
So so again, you know, this one is our our highest rated so far, but only a little bit more than mommy's ring.

621
00:45:35,242 --> 00:45:42,345
I mentioned that it had been a long time since I read this one. So, you know, I definitely remembered it because I read all the time as a kid.

622
00:45:42,879 --> 00:45:50,069
But I had so much distance from it. Was a real joy to go back and read this one and remember the different story beats.

623
00:45:50,642 --> 00:45:51,142
And,

624
00:45:51,479 --> 00:45:57,929
you know, I probably hadn't read it since I was a teenager. So I I loved reading this. I loved the

625
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,329
Again, the danger,

626
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:00,449
the

627
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:19,009
setting I thought was really great. I definitely liked the city I thought that the way the snow level changed was kinda reminiscent of almost a video game level. You know, I like to imagine and I like to think about that. So This one was a real winner for me, and

628
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:19,809
I

629
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:21,969
I had a lot of fun reading it.

630
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:33,486
What did you think about it? This one Ryan? I liked it Al lot. I think I also would have ranked it higher than the mommy's ring. Was a good a kind of a simple story, but still like a really harrowing

631
00:46:34,278 --> 00:46:36,492
survival kind of element to it of

632
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:41,275
man versus nature or duck versus nature and then duck versus also some

633
00:46:41,692 --> 00:46:42,090
goo.

634
00:46:42,584 --> 00:46:43,084
Excellent.

635
00:46:44,262 --> 00:46:49,197
The impression I got, I I didn't see a lot of articles about this one.

636
00:46:49,616 --> 00:47:06,430
Many of these stories have have a lot written about them. I didn't see too much. But my impression is that this one is is regarded as you would expect based on that rating. You know, it's an early Barks story. So it's showcasing what is style, you know, what what the format is adventure stories are gonna be. But it is

637
00:47:07,247 --> 00:47:08,405
very well regarded.

638
00:47:08,899 --> 00:47:09,736
Classic Barks.

639
00:47:10,774 --> 00:47:13,109
I think that this one holds up

640
00:47:13,726 --> 00:47:18,113
generally really well, you know, we've definitely got and stuff that's pretty dated

641
00:47:18,572 --> 00:47:20,710
some archaic treatments of the es,

642
00:47:21,928 --> 00:47:22,788
rather i,

643
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:25,545
you know, the way that Donald talks to anything

644
00:47:25,979 --> 00:47:26,479
his

645
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:27,680
is

646
00:47:28,299 --> 00:47:29,160
kinda cringey,

647
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:39,768
but he does... He doesn't... He does say, hey, es, as he's coming around the side of of the igloo. He knows what what all of their names start. They're always asking. Yeah. But...

648
00:47:40,306 --> 00:47:50,354
Yeah. And and he does he does actually say the line. Oh maybe maybe he's not used to white men. No doubt he's cow in terror. So that's definitely very

649
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:55,634
but on the whole, I think I think Barks depiction of

650
00:47:56,012 --> 00:48:03,105
point barr as an na village was a very nice treatment of it. You know, they they didn't look very

651
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:04,181
native

652
00:48:04,598 --> 00:48:05,098
quotes.

653
00:48:05,595 --> 00:48:06,573
It looks like

654
00:48:07,443 --> 00:48:08,780
modern for the time

655
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:13,084
connected to the world as much they could be. True. I I also

656
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:15,356
give Barks credit for the fact that

657
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:19,126
there was not an person cow and terror in the igloo.

658
00:48:19,665 --> 00:48:23,441
Yes. That Al as Donald was walking in there and

659
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,607
saying idiotic things, he was also clearly being an actual idiot.

660
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:29,122
Just,

661
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:41,138
you know, trying to buy the fur coat off of the gigantic bear that's in in there with him and and everything. It it was not... He was not the hero in that see. Right. Right. And that's a good point. As far as appearances

662
00:48:41,714 --> 00:48:43,464
in other media or other

663
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:56,992
our work. This is not a story that Barks he didn't do any of his famous oil paintings for this one. So I don't get to share one of those with you. This one to my knowledge has never been referenced

664
00:48:57,489 --> 00:49:00,639
or kind of featured in either the Ducktales series.

665
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:08,739
Identifying this one. A very educational. I think this one's the most... The the one that I learned the most. Like, I I can remember

666
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:18,664
learning a lot when I was a kid from the specific story. So this this gave me some interest in, you know, arctic life and

667
00:49:19,004 --> 00:49:19,984
some terms

668
00:49:20,364 --> 00:49:24,824
for surrounding the the arctic north. Ryan did you

669
00:49:25,178 --> 00:49:30,887
have a favorite panel that came to mind or any any panels that are kind of contenders for your favor?

670
00:49:31,725 --> 00:49:36,314
Although go with the one I mentioned at the beginning with the fifteen minutes later,

671
00:49:36,814 --> 00:49:41,234
so mister Duck, you're ready to trade your house and lot for four use snow shovel in my airplane.

672
00:49:42,948 --> 00:49:48,642
Yeah. That's a good good signing the papers. That's how long it takes to to sell a house in Duck

673
00:49:48,982 --> 00:49:50,361
in nineteen forty five.

674
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:51,560
Excellent.

675
00:49:52,152 --> 00:49:59,965
So my favorite panel, There were a couple that I was considering. I I mentioned the one where he's str at the beginning in front of all the newspaper headlines.

676
00:50:00,618 --> 00:50:03,552
But I think my favorite had to be

677
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:05,987
cabin... The plane hauling the cabin

678
00:50:06,405 --> 00:50:06,905
sequence.

679
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:11,546
The the one where they're they're towing the cabin behind is great.

680
00:50:12,122 --> 00:50:13,419
The one where pete

681
00:50:13,835 --> 00:50:15,291
slams into the

682
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:16,585
the cables.

683
00:50:17,237 --> 00:50:26,031
And then the other one, you know what? I'll I'll say that my favorite panel is the parachute catch when he jumps off the cliff and the Nephews

684
00:50:26,664 --> 00:50:35,635
grab from the of the bear. And yeah. It spans across the whole page. You can really see like the motion of the plane as it goes up and then down

685
00:50:36,308 --> 00:50:41,961
swoop down to kind of make the make the catch and then bring back up so that it doesn't land and you can see the baffles

686
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,059
bear.

687
00:50:43,553 --> 00:50:51,836
Up on the cliff, watching watching them pull this off. It's a good it's a good good shot. Yeah. And and then the little bulge of Donald in the parachute

688
00:50:52,348 --> 00:51:00,982
any final thoughts for frozen gold? No. I I think it's cool. Like where it's going. I like that it surprises me a couple times. Awesome.

689
00:51:01,421 --> 00:51:07,045
