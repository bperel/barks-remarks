Hello, and welcome to Barks remark. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks, creator of sc Mc and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comics of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological publishing or We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks.

2
00:00:49,477 --> 00:00:54,442
Hello, and welcome back to Barks remarks. I am still Barks Sever.

3
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:57,330
Still a grown man who enjoys donald dot comics.

4
00:00:58,182 --> 00:00:59,080
I've managed

5
00:00:59,497 --> 00:01:02,109
to con yet another friend into

6
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,956
letting me talk about comics with him.

7
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,630
We have a first time guest today. If you can introduce yourself, please.

8
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:19,205
Hello? My name is Ben Johnson. I'm a big comic book nerd, but not as big as smart and, yeah, I'm excited

9
00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:23,580
to talk about Donald Duck. He's one of my favorite disney characters.

10
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,860
Excellent.

11
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,040
Ben, do you have any experience with the Carl Barks

12
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:30,495
stories at all?

13
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:47,900
No. Not really. I you know, introduced to watching Donald cartoons when I was younger and, you know, Ducktales when I was whenever that was on the Disney afternoon and stuff. Yeah. Those were great. Right. And and Ducktales was, of course, based on many of the Barks stories.

14
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:49,652
But

15
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,766
he actually did work on a lot of those early

16
00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:54,123
duck cartoons

17
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:57,895
too before he transitioned over to doing the comment.

18
00:01:59,105 --> 00:01:59,605
Excellent.

19
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:00,482
And

20
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:03,310
we are here to discuss

21
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:05,475
adventure down under

22
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:08,435
which is kind of the mandatory

23
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:11,355
Australian foray. The

24
00:02:11,895 --> 00:02:17,450
sort of every Tv series or ever every adventure series has to have the Australia

25
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,690
episode. Right?

26
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:31,517
Yeah. You know, that's pretty unique place. And so you can't really have where adventures take place and not do an Australian episode or issue. Right. And and we've been... We've been around the globe where just about,

27
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:33,310
I think, ten

28
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:40,697
episodes in and we've been on in a mississippi river. We've been Egypt we've been in the West Indies.

29
00:02:41,114 --> 00:02:42,930
We've been all over the place. So

30
00:02:43,307 --> 00:02:47,888
Al lot of fun globe t in the Carl Barks stories. You actually

31
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:49,959
spend some time in Australia

32
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:54,195
yourself, which is a big part of why I wanted this to be your first

33
00:02:54,813 --> 00:03:00,859
episode. Yeah. Yeah. I'm very familiar with Kangaroo and I was there for two years out in the bush. So

34
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:12,425
I was pretty much went through all the same things that Donald went through here. So... Yeah. You you actually did get to be in the Al west west populated part hunt. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. So

35
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:15,145
let's go into a little bit of the

36
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,105
overview about this issue.

37
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,956
Again, adventure down under is

38
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:31,711
from July of nineteen forty seven. This one was published in four color one hundred and fifty nine, which is the same issue

39
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:33,440
that our last

40
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:41,223
episode. Our last story ghost of the g was in and that one had the cover story or the cover art rather,

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,473
but it's it's kind of

42
00:03:43,850 --> 00:04:03,793
note notable. I think that these two major and very well remembered stories were originally published together. That's not something that happens all the time. It has, of course, been reprinted many many times. I first read in Donald Ducktales adventures number eleven Barks I think in nineteen eighty nine, this one is twenty five pages

43
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:19,045
and new to the podcast, I've decided that I should be having our guests offer up our brief synopsis of the story before we go into the narrative later. So Ben. Let's hear it. What is this story about

44
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:25,785
Well, you know, it starts off just like any adventure. They're sitting at home. Trying to think of something like fun to do. They

45
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:28,576
walk out of the street and come across a h

46
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,786
which I think all good stories

47
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,840
start by people getting h ties.

48
00:04:33,798 --> 00:04:40,285
Donald gets h baptized into thinking he's a kangaroo and filling homes sick So he's they find a way to

49
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:41,905
Australia and

50
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:43,305
meet a

51
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:49,234
kind of a shady character with a mustache, and that sends him off hunting Kangaroo,

52
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:58,155
and there's some aboriginal and all kinds of of hi and sue. Yeah. Lot lots of very Australian elements.

53
00:04:58,855 --> 00:05:05,710
And we'll talk about... Yeah. I I I like that I've got you on, and I can ask you, you know, how true some of the stuff rings.

54
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,370
Sure. Yeah. Thank you for that.

55
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,984
So a little bit of sort of background Trivia.

56
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,254
I mentioned already that this is the b story

57
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,447
that was after it goes to the g.

58
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,930
This is the second story that we've done that is

59
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:30,863
rated in the top fifty and is actually our first to be topped a top ten rated story of learning end up. Which will go into a little bit more.

60
00:05:31,202 --> 00:05:34,100
Another new thing that I'd like to do now

61
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,896
starting this episode, I I've noticed when doing research

62
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:44,330
that these stories, the titles get translated in kind of a variety of ways around the world.

63
00:05:44,930 --> 00:06:04,942
And this one seemed to have a particular... They're particularly wide number of titles. So I wanted to just talk about what some of those were because I think it's fine, and I like to try to wrap my wrap my math around saying things in languages that I don't speak, well probably not very successfully. But in Brazil, this was called I was a Kangaroo

64
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:05,859
or

65
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:07,853
kangaroo

66
00:06:08,191 --> 00:06:10,046
in France, this is

67
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:12,896
the generic Donald in Australia. Al.

68
00:06:14,546 --> 00:06:16,100
In Germany, this is

69
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:17,676
Australian adventure

70
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:19,249
Al

71
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:24,329
toy, I think. In Italy, it's Kangaroo Hunter

72
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:25,746
D.

73
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:27,502
Mexico

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,498
is Australian adventure

75
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:31,129
they are Claudia.

76
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:32,108
Netherlands

77
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,947
is

78
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:34,905
adventure in the anti

79
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,060
or Ava tour b did

80
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:40,592
hanging waters.

81
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:45,039
And then in Spain, it's different than Mexico.

82
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:48,069
I was a kangaroo.

83
00:06:48,688 --> 00:06:50,866
Another bit of trivia

84
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,983
the... I'll just the on that too, I wanna add

85
00:06:54,402 --> 00:06:55,861
the down under

86
00:06:56,974 --> 00:07:01,834
probably doesn't have... They're they're down under to us, but maybe in Brazil

87
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:02,914
down under

88
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:11,832
right like, a little bit to the left, over. And I like say... Yes. You don't i I would imagine that the... That's probably the reason for

89
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:14,721
changing it in some of those languages and countries

90
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,061
Right. Is that something that I I think they do refer to themselves as being down under. Right?

91
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,703
Yeah. I mean, they're familiar with it. I don't think they refer to themselves

92
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,340
as being down under, but they are aware that Americans refer to them because they're not down under to themselves. Right. Right.

93
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:38,000
Make any me? Yeah. I mean... And and America has gone through, like, it's Australia

94
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,529
fascination with the right or like

95
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:47,789
he's with crocodile cut and never. And I imagine it must be kind of infuriating. Well, it's kinda interesting to see something in the context of, you know...

96
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:50,264
For Steve Irwin and

97
00:07:51,365 --> 00:08:05,534
Crocodile Dundee movies because Yeah. I think if this had taken place after, maybe it would have a character like that in here. But we don't have that stereotype yet. It's true. I think this must have been fairly early in the like

98
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:15,165
fascination with Australia. Right? Because this isn't the latest forties. And I can't think of a lot of media that is that sort of owe american in Australia.

99
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,317
From that era.

100
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:20,884
I also found it to be notable that the

101
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:24,872
the aboriginal in this were among the very first human

102
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:25,844
characters

103
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,626
that Barks has drawn so far. You know, he doesn't usually

104
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:55,256
put characters as like humans. Huey, he depicts them as like dog usually. And and we'll talk about, you know, there Barks certainly problems with their depiction but they are sure. Unlike most of the background characters, they're actually those humans. Yeah. It is... I haven't thought about I I mean, when I was a kid, I remember thinking because there's regular animals in the in this universe

105
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:57,452
and they're different from the ant

106
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:05,225
animals in it. And I I always wondered about that. Yeah. And when I bring people and in for the these newbie

107
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:17,818
slots like urine. This is always one of the things that they get focused on. Right? Like, are these... Are these animals are these? And any answer is Huey, human. You know, like, they're there are people

108
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:20,370
they're duct people on dog people.

109
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:22,643
And we only occasionally

110
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,505
think about the fact that they're also animals. And I guess this story is one of those rare times too.

111
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:33,220
Alright. So for the value range of this one,

112
00:09:33,794 --> 00:09:37,890
The highest documented sale was seventy five hundred dollars

113
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:38,808
for.

114
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:54,384
Yeah. Nine point six rate. Which is the same mh as it was last episode. Right? Because this is from ghosts, this has the same is in the same comic as ghost of the g. So we're gonna launch now into a little bit of

115
00:09:54,881 --> 00:10:00,345
one of my favorite parts, the the background where we talk about some historical and geographical context.

116
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:08,641
Again, we are in nineteen forty seven right now. And I think that American attitudes

117
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:15,321
from about Australia, or probably not the same as they are today. Right? It was probably

118
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:23,256
regarded as much more remote and, you know, i I think we get a taste to that when Donald talks about how now it civilized.

119
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:27,962
And I think there was this feeling that until recently it hadn't been civilized.

120
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,237
Yeah. It's probably... you know, once

121
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:37,075
air travel has become, like, because I mentioned air... you know, feet travels was there by playing. And, you know, and...

122
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:38,567
Yeah. That that...

123
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:45,900
That was weird... And I can't remember where it was when it meets that stranger with the mustache it seemed out a context like comments about

124
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:57,251
civilized. I see, I couldn't quite follow what they were talking about. Yeah. And and, you know, it's one of the things that I think is the undertone for a lot of these stories is that idea of civilization,

125
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:58,209
but

126
00:10:58,587 --> 00:11:01,243
but it also makes for some very interesting

127
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:04,589
and adventure stories. Yeah. For, you know,

128
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:18,188
for children and and viewing things with a sense of, like civilization versus something worth exploring and I give them a little leeway just to seem a little bit more interesting No ben. These stories are

129
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:19,362
one year old.

130
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:21,714
Having a podcast.

131
00:11:22,855 --> 00:11:26,314
What I mean clearly. Yes. Yes. Absolutely to fully

132
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:30,966
we we appreciate that these are are and stories and

133
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:33,276
that Barks has put so much

134
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:40,711
care into them that I think they've been so well remembered. I... It comes up to me, because when I read this, that's one thing I've been...

135
00:11:41,250 --> 00:12:13,854
Especially this issue is it's brought to the forefront. I can tell Carl Barks he's he's very good at almost like Calvin and Hobbes where it's an adult, but he tells a story from the perspective of a child. There's so much media and content that we see now. You can tell it's adult trying to write things four children, but you can tell he has a way of making it almost seem like it's from the perspective of a child. Yeah. And and I think... And he never talks down. Yeah. Yeah. Even a little bit. And and sometimes some of that's just an effect of

136
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:18,890
you know, in the forties and fifties, like kids, there was kind of a different attitude

137
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:24,578
about childhood and kids were more independent. So some of that stuff is kind of jarring. But

138
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:28,226
but it's great that he never never Barks down. Yeah.

139
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:29,364
Definitely.

140
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:46,889
So for for the background to me one of the natural things to focus on is this just the idea of the Kangaroo as the national animal of Australia. And you know, I think one of the really striking things in this comic is the depiction of them as pests.

141
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:50,889
Right? I think I think if you're familiar with Australia,

142
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:52,504
that is

143
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:52,964
like,

144
00:12:53,843 --> 00:13:06,949
very logical. Right? Yeah. I imagine you have some experience with that. But I think to most Americans when they first read it, it might be jarring to think about their, like, iconic animal as a pest. Yeah. They're

145
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:13,118
I wouldn't put them exactly in the same category as a pest. I guess I don't mean like a pest like...

146
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:22,201
But but kinda like in the in the same vein as diet for America? Yeah. Yeah. Well, the main the main risk, there was a a small village I was living in. That was

147
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:26,128
you or it's about a three hour drive that I would do pretty regularly

148
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:59,574
for one little town to another town. And if you go at Don or dusk you can't go five miles without seeing a, you know, car of a kangaroo and and they they have the tendency to just stand on the edge of the road and they have this look, like, twitch look in the eyes, like, am Not gonna jump. Can I jump? And I think they they think that they can jump over the cars. Their ability to judge how fast they're going. And and so it's they're a danger for people driving those roads. And they even have... They have... And they install these things called Barks that it comes out of the grill, and it goes

149
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:25,909
up above the driver's side and sometimes on the passenger side... And basically, so it just kinda tears the kangaroo in half to either side of you. Rather than going through the windshield and killing it because they jump right before impact going right through the windshield instead of hitting the bumper. So it's they're not... So not really a pest and they don't go in and, you know, in this in the comic, they're terror... They're gone and and ruining the crops and you know, they're doing some things that cares, you know, don't really do. They...

150
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:29,664
And I read a little bit that maybe they don't terror

151
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:34,692
crops in this way, but I I think that there have been periods

152
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:45,843
based on my reading correct me if I'm wrong, where like, they are a real menace to to heard ranch and to agriculture when they've been Al their like, over populated

153
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:46,681
key.

154
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:53,169
Yeah. By the time I was there, population control wasn't really Al issue was mainly mainly just

155
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:54,048
dangerous

156
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:57,979
for people driving down the roads. Right. Yeah. And

157
00:14:58,318 --> 00:15:08,898
I I know I read that they have, like, a calling quota where they... There's a certain number of them that are allowed to be killed because they do try so to manage the population. Yeah. They

158
00:15:09,554 --> 00:15:12,607
i was friends with some aboriginal people there. And

159
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:16,209
apparently, the aboriginal are allowed to hunt them and they actually just

160
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:25,981
go and you you'll go camping and they'll... And I actually went camping with them a few times and literally just sw over the side of the road when they see one pull out a rifle

161
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:26,874
and

162
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,178
just shoot one and put in the back of the pickup truck and that was our dinner.

163
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:33,330
There you then how is Kangaroo?

164
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:38,339
It's Well you you can go to the grocery store, you know, we didn't have a lot of money there. So

165
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:46,548
I was like, oh, this is a way cheaper than ground beef for my spaghetti. So it it's definitely it really game, not not very good, but if you had enough

166
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,461
know pasta the sauce to it, you know.

167
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:58,214
And then the last thing to say about kangaroo is something that, like, everyone knows at this point, but it kind of Barks saying that the the pouch

168
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,804
never works the way.

169
00:16:00,523 --> 00:16:04,339
Never works the way that they depicted in the cartoons.

170
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:08,415
It's a lot gui. Right? It's it doesn't it's the other

171
00:16:08,849 --> 00:16:11,943
background in this that, you know, is is a little less

172
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:23,373
fun to talk about is the depiction of of the aboriginal. Right? Like... And I was really interested it by it because, you know, you have to acknowledge right away that it's it's a it's cara.

173
00:16:23,711 --> 00:16:27,699
You know, they're using that pigeon speed. They're depicted as as cannibal,

174
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,379
I think long past

175
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,139
when that

176
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,819
would have been a concern

177
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:45,119
I I read a little bit about it. And and from what I can tell, there's no greater incidence of cannibalism in Australia compared to, like, any other

178
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:46,198
indigenous

179
00:16:46,736 --> 00:16:47,236
society

180
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,475
around the world.

181
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:56,513
So that's unfortunate. But the the interesting thing to me was it looked like he went out of his way to, like, visually

182
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,503
depict them at least somewhat accurately.

183
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:05,058
Yeah. I mean, it takes I mean, obviously, the car is or the over

184
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:06,134
characterized

185
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:13,250
depiction is a little problematic, but it's they have the dot... The dot style artwork

186
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:15,047
on their bodies,

187
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:26,654
which you do see an aboriginal artwork is that, you know, the the doc... I don't know. There's a word for it I can't remember, but it's where they, you know, represent sort of lines. It's through dots. There's

188
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:31,894
snakes and lines that, you know, it's close. It's it's as good as someone

189
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:37,869
expect from somebody in the forties days to do. Right. I... I'm sure it's like mixing elements.

190
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:39,909
But the thing is that it really

191
00:17:40,249 --> 00:17:51,285
contrasts with just, like, their look. Is a lot more accurate than like, you know, I think the sort of savage way that he depicts them. The is kind of a mixture of different things.

192
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:57,127
There's a boot... We have Al boomerang. You gotta have a boomerang ring. So that's that's it's good story. Yeah. Alright.

193
00:17:57,806 --> 00:18:04,824
As far as notable appearances go, we have mourn mary I would say is the most notable one. We don't have any

194
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:20,392
characters that are gonna go on to be reoccurring. And then I've been talking about kind of the version of of the hero that we get. And what's interesting, I I called Donald in this passive Donald. Right? Because throughout this whole story, He's very

195
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,349
compliant.

196
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:29,779
He's just kind of Al long for the ride. Right? At the very beginning, the kids are able to just really easily convince him to go go make vacation.

197
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,219
He immediately gets h

198
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,059
in a passive way. He he gets quickly pressed into bounty hunting kangaroo.

199
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:42,276
And then, you know, he's extremely passive when he's taken by at first by more

200
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:45,465
And then by the aboriginal.

201
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:51,659
And then again, my mourn marriage. So, like, he's always just kind of being passive, and he's always at someone else's

202
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:53,599
command or, you know,

203
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:58,350
control in this one which was striking to me. I mean, he was.

204
00:18:58,929 --> 00:18:59,629
He was.

205
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:01,746
Yeah. So... Yeah.

206
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:08,493
Alright. So are you ready to go into the actual content of the story? Well, let's do it.

207
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:11,710
Alright. So adventure down under

208
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:13,641
opens up with

209
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:16,553
the... Just kind of a very boring

210
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:28,043
sedentary life for Donald and the kids. At home, you know, Donald is there's a really nice sight got right away in the very first panel where Donald just reading boarding Ducktales

211
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,981
by W blow hard

212
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:38,859
looking very to. And the kids are asking him if they can't take a vacation before their school starts up again. And un

213
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,339
donald

214
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:45,539
breeze right away and says that they should enjoy some time in Catalina.

215
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,074
Island off coast of California.

216
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:52,194
Right? I think that was a much more popular vacation

217
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:55,594
site once upon a time. I don't know. I lived in California

218
00:19:55,949 --> 00:20:02,515
for many years and never made it out there. At any rate, Donald grabs some of their savings and they go to get

219
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:07,877
some airline tickets and they and they passed by a outdoor

220
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:09,473
radio station

221
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,707
broadcast where someone

222
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:16,675
the radio announcer or Dj is introducing a professor

223
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,390
with one of those great Barks cnn names Argus Gi.

224
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:31,295
And this professor Gi is going to h digitize a volunteer from the crowd. And he's got a great sort of generic mystic accent and says how's do.

225
00:20:31,993 --> 00:20:33,411
Ben, what do you think of

226
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:35,026
esther Barks

227
00:20:35,186 --> 00:21:01,914
Gi with i there? So first of all, that's... I love his depiction with his fur brow. Like, he... I... I'm kind of h just looking at him. His eyes just pull me in and like I'll I'll I'll become like kangaroo if he tells me to. Yeah. He's he's got that top hat and a bow tie, but man in hence looked on his face. And he was really born for the job. And I have to say I... That... Like i like I mentioned earlier about

228
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:04,626
understanding how kids see the world. I

229
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,295
excite in the beginning.

230
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:12,560
I I feel like all kids see books that adults read as having that having titles like that.

231
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:26,587
I see that is like that's it was hilarious. I mean... I I guess actually left out loud because it caught off guard when I saw that Donald just reading a book called boring tales. I also just... Just like you said, looking at the professor.

232
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,772
Very pretty. Yeah. That's just a great

233
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:36,366
it's exactly what I would imagine somebody in the forties would look like who would advertise people.

234
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:38,969
Excellent. So

235
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:46,154
On the next page, Donald, and the kids are approaching and they they hear that whoever volunteers to get h,

236
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:47,484
can expect

237
00:21:48,184 --> 00:22:02,257
ten dollars, and nice little line here ten dollars and cool, cr cash. Definitely sounds like, you know, an old time Dj would say that. And Donald is, you know, he's seen that as spending money in Catalina. So he volunteers.

238
00:22:02,935 --> 00:22:09,193
And and we get a a really cool and weird panel here where we get fate

239
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,270
personified.

240
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:13,817
Alright? And and kind of crying and w

241
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:15,947
and just

242
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:59,101
foreshadowing for us that Donald, you're going to be sorry, it it trails off. And it could me threw me off. I I had to read it, like, three times I'm like, is that? I've never seen fate. Fade is depicted Al like, yeah, this is the way things are going, but fate seems like sad that this is the way things are going. Yeah. And... And this is a very unusual panel. I think he doesn't... He didn't do this very often so I... There was some similar stuff in ghost of the g where it was very overt. And that just might have been what he wanted to experiment with that. That month, But I really like it. So Donald is super eager with the the radio Dj. He's anticipating his every question answering what his name is

243
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:02,994
ahead of time that confirming he's never been h.

244
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:04,274
So

245
00:23:04,854 --> 00:23:06,074
the Dj

246
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:14,729
sets it up and, you know, ponder, what what is he gonna h ties him into is he gonna make him a dog or a monkey or a sea going groundhog

247
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:17,024
and we get to see

248
00:23:17,642 --> 00:23:26,029
Donald being put into a tran by the professor. It's a the kind of depiction you would expect and a little jedi mind trick. What

249
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:28,769
gone there. Yeah. He's got the little wavy fingers,

250
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:29,869
classic.

251
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:34,900
We get a great he give... He hit Donald with a doo.

252
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,118
He tells him you are a kangaroo

253
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:47,489
and you are very very home sick. And what... You know, what a great, great way to set up an Australian adventure story, I think.

254
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:48,189
Right,

255
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:51,704
Alright. So the the last panel in this page

256
00:23:52,284 --> 00:24:05,650
has the nephews observing and and the crowd observing donald whim and crying and he's posture like a kangaroo. It's clearly worked out really well. Yeah. I don't know. I find it odd that the h would add the homes part.

257
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,322
Because I don't feel like that would add much

258
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:18,399
entertainment value. It's almost like he's he wants him to just go to Australia. Right? He's gil the lily a little bit there. And but I think...

259
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:21,250
Maybe he's playing to the radio audience, you know Yeah.

260
00:24:21,984 --> 00:24:35,455
But I I just... I love the setup for this. Alright. So I like the dotted lines going from the eyes and his just limp arms like Huey, He's he's definitely there. Yep. So on the next page, we see him

261
00:24:35,794 --> 00:24:44,580
acting like the homes kangaroo that he believes himself to be the the Dj j is really selling it. It's talking about him acting homes sick and

262
00:24:45,078 --> 00:24:46,337
facing the west

263
00:24:46,676 --> 00:24:47,935
to smell

264
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:51,003
sniff at the air and dream of far off

265
00:24:51,442 --> 00:25:01,966
Australia. As you mentioned, he refers to it in the far off entities. I think anti is just means the, like bottom half of the earth, but or or the... Yeah. Why

266
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:03,639
of the earth.

267
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:08,641
I had to look at it's like that region of New zealand Australia.

268
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,794
Donald has a thought balloon of him

269
00:25:12,332 --> 00:25:20,991
crying and thinking about kangaroo like him. And I... That's a great panel right there. I love that panel. It sums it up. And all of a sudden, he

270
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:25,957
bounds off with a happy look in his face stunning the crowd, the h

271
00:25:26,456 --> 00:25:43,909
professor can't get in contact with him because he's too far away, and he is bounding off much faster and higher than you should be able to. And, you know, the nephews are worried. The h says it should wear off in a few hours, but who knows what could happen This is why we...

272
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:52,824
Most modern hit just make people signed waivers because of stuff like this. That's right. On the next page Donald bounds off to the

273
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:55,400
airline office to buy a ticket.

274
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,340
And

275
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,508
I I really like the fact that he is now na. He's got human speech even though he's a kangaroo.

276
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:06,943
He's saying, I'm a home kangaroo and I know how to go home.

277
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:14,905
And he explains this to the tickets seller. Mh who tells him, oh, your home would be australia. Just a moment kangaroo.

278
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:19,335
And, you know, Donald very kind

279
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:42,929
asks him to make a four tickets so that his kangaroo nephews can come too. And the ticket seller completes the transaction for four hundred dollars. Didn't look up what that would be, but sound definitely sounds like a lot. And clerk wishes him well until he does a double take and and says gracious six, that wasn't a kangaroo. That was a person. Kangaroo don't have four hundred dollars.

280
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:53,244
I love the a joke was funny because it's the the money aspect of it. That was the part. That it was funny. They're wait a minute. It's like saying,

281
00:26:53,939 --> 00:27:02,399
C don't have blue hats. Yeah. And I remember even as a kid. I loved this interaction. It was just so ridiculous. And totally dis.

282
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:05,492
Cleric, literally thinking oh.

283
00:27:05,872 --> 00:27:08,250
Because the eyes are just barely open the sliver.

284
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:42,786
Right. So on the next page, the nephews have caught up with Donald who beck and them to follow him, and he leads them to what he calls the clipper base. I guess that's where these clipper planes takeoff off. This is a pretty cool way to travel. It seems Well, at any anyway, they they see him board the Australia clipper and they're freaked out. They've gotta get him out, but he refuses. He says home to kangaroo Is Australia. And they asked the captain for help getting him out. But the captain's like, why should I he gave me four tickets to Australia?

285
00:27:43,465 --> 00:27:44,285
So the Nephews

286
00:27:44,838 --> 00:27:48,206
yeah. You know, He can't really beat his logic. He was given tickets.

287
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,763
Yeah. I I know. Very sound right. Alright. So the Nephews,

288
00:27:53,658 --> 00:28:01,256
you know, they convene and they talk about the fact that, hey, Mcdonald's got tickets for all of us. So we get to go to Australia. Hours,

289
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:16,346
pass a really nice panel nighttime panel of them descending. The Donald is the first of the ducks to wake up. And, you know, he he looks out of the plane he's kinda coming to. He's wondering why he doesn't remember getting the catalina tickets and

290
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:21,704
flight attendant tells him to buckle up because they're about to land in Sydney, Australia.

291
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:38,399
Alright. So on the next page, Donald has realized what's going on and we don't see the explanation which is nice because we know what's going on. It just transitions to to later. And you know what I think is interesting here. We fly into I guess, Sydney Harbor.

292
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:43,165
There's Al lot of cloud cover there. So we don't really see a lot of the city skyline.

293
00:28:43,662 --> 00:28:48,187
And then the next panel just transitions to, like a generic city, The only

294
00:28:48,539 --> 00:29:07,369
thing that really indicates that it's Australia is a poster for cricket matches. Yeah. It seems like such a gimme to like show, you know, the shorthand for Australia and Sydney Harbor is the opera house. And I I realized that it hasn't even no built at this time that was by first not too. I when I saw this. I was like, are they

295
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:24,167
just putting clouds there? Because they don't wanna draw it. And then I'm like, you know what, maybe didn't exist yet. You know. Yeah. I looked it up. I I... Because this this struck me on hindsight, but but it was definitely later. I wanna say nineteen fifty seven. Is like when the planning commission got away. But

296
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:26,562
there's not really a lot of other

297
00:29:28,178 --> 00:29:32,050
for here we're in Australia until you are in the outback. Right?

298
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:36,251
Yeah. You know, it's it's the opera house and the the bridge there.

299
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:41,029
Yeah. You know, I attribute. Well, I saw the bridge and that's when I was looking for the opera house, but i

300
00:29:41,926 --> 00:29:45,217
I mean, yeah, there's not really any distinguishing

301
00:29:45,753 --> 00:29:46,253
features.

302
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:48,884
So Australia rules football

303
00:29:49,301 --> 00:30:07,420
was from the people I knew there was a a bigger deal than than cricket. Maybe Barks didn't wanna get confusing with Right. Because I don't think they call it Aussie rules football there. They just called it football ball. But fucking. Yeah. That would be a a cricket he's like, alright. What do we... What I got to work with here? And there's a

304
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:14,421
recognizable bridge and they play cricket there. Well we'll we'll be in the outback soon and and you'll be reminded constantly.

305
00:30:14,998 --> 00:30:20,382
But for now, Donald is just grip, you know, he's he's in a bad mood pretty understandably.

306
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:41,594
And the Nephews are like, come on. Stop driving. Let's have some fun and, you know, this prompts dawn, Will just say that you can have any fun in Australia. The country is too civilized, you know, which which it seems like a weird thing to say. But I think it's just the setup, right? For us to meet this. Yeah. This stranger with the pretty spectacular

307
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:45,249
mustache, and he is the one that makes the off

308
00:30:46,188 --> 00:30:50,323
to the Nephews. He he encourages them to come to his

309
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:51,282
station

310
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,612
his sheep station, station being the term for ranch.

311
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,128
And the he'll pay them to hunt

312
00:30:59,707 --> 00:31:00,207
and,

313
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:03,897
you know, don all this like, Huey, me. You want me to hunt,

314
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:07,489
and we get a good faint gag where he says Kangaroo.

315
00:31:08,346 --> 00:31:27,092
Yeah. I thought it was interesting that like, if there were some wild Indians or more buffalo or I don't know, some kind of native Australian animal. Like, almost like you forget that i suspect Kangaroo exist. I was confusing that he mentions Buffalo and he's looking for something interesting. But he literally was just p digitized as a kangaroo

316
00:31:27,524 --> 00:31:32,464
and he gets here and they're, like, oh, if only, there was some kind of wild native animal

317
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:33,604
anywhere around here.

318
00:31:34,164 --> 00:31:34,359
Exactly.

319
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:36,156
And Huey, literally

320
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:38,907
describing, like, the American frontier.

321
00:31:39,404 --> 00:31:47,064
Right? Mh. And so much American media at this time was like like fascinated by the American frontier.

322
00:31:47,444 --> 00:31:49,064
Right? Could you see all those western

323
00:31:49,364 --> 00:32:05,604
and stuff. So I think some of this is just kind of playing out a frontier fantasy in a different kind of Yeah. Well, I... Yeah. I kind of after thinking about it a little more. I think they just wanted to in case we couldn't do it on our own because the whole concept of a frontier

324
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,404
is something familiar, but maybe his readers

325
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,046
aren't familiar as much with Australia. So in one panel, it says

326
00:32:13,463 --> 00:32:17,112
wild Indians and Buffalo and then the next panel, bush

327
00:32:17,464 --> 00:32:32,629
and hunting and then talking about Heroes. So I think he just wanted to put those concepts side by side. Right. It's it's very Australia one zero one. Yeah. Yeah. I think they're lang setting a table that maybe we don't really need these days, but they needed.

328
00:32:33,504 --> 00:32:39,033
Alright. So on the next page, you know, Donald recovers, and the man explains that

329
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:49,511
he will pay two pounds for every kangaroo that they bring in and five hundred pounds for mourn mary, either dead or alive.

330
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:52,683
He explains that she is the queen of the kangaroo.

331
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,395
She lost her baby months ago and has been, like, leading

332
00:32:58,869 --> 00:32:59,369
Kangaroo

333
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:06,409
rating on ranchers pasture. And the Ducktales decide, yeah. Let's do it. We're gonna be kangaroo hunters.

334
00:33:07,203 --> 00:33:09,299
They're gonna have some adventure and

335
00:33:09,996 --> 00:33:13,626
maybe make the five hundred pounds that they need to... I don't know, get tickets home.

336
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:22,893
So they they fly out to his sheep station. It's a pretty cool panel depicting the sheep nation. The

337
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:24,728
station manager

338
00:33:25,386 --> 00:33:28,400
tells them where they can find kangaroo and he

339
00:33:28,738 --> 00:33:37,680
dives the plane down low. Scatter several dozen homes so that they can see how overrun with Kangaroo the area is. Yeah. That was

340
00:33:38,273 --> 00:33:40,925
one thing that stood out here is, you know, because

341
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:49,311
now they used dollars that they they have Australian dollars. So they'd I was, like, pounds. They don't use pounds there, but then I was remembering

342
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:50,229
Yeah.

343
00:33:50,766 --> 00:34:00,474
They they originally did use the British pound and I don't know when... So I guess when this was written, they probably did use pounds there. But they they just use the word dollars now.

344
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:11,764
Just like we do, but it's the Australian dollar. Right. Yeah. And I thought about that too. I didn't check when they made that transition. But as you say, some sometime after this story. Yeah. This sheep

345
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:14,082
stations are pretty common there.

346
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:19,675
I spent some time out on some of these sheep stations. And, yeah, they the legitimately did pay people

347
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:21,525
you know, they pay them per

348
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:25,593
pay people to thin out the herd and just

349
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:34,034
when maybe get over populated, so that's not an uncommon thing back then. Right. Alright. So as they dive down, you know, they see

350
00:34:34,335 --> 00:34:37,489
they see kangaroo jumping over the wings up Al plain

351
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,409
pretty fan, but Al little a little site visual.

352
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:47,263
And they land so that they can get to where. And the nephews used point out

353
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,201
one of the kangaroo on top of the plane, and the station manager instantly

354
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:57,729
recognizes it. As mourn Mary who has, you know, a pretty

355
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:03,189
vicious looking Al on her face. She plants herself. She jumps on his chest.

356
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:04,582
And

357
00:35:04,921 --> 00:35:06,578
hops away and

358
00:35:07,195 --> 00:35:09,190
he is upping his auntie.

359
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:16,850
He's upping the bounty now to thousand pounds reward for her hide, again, dead or alive. Yeah. That's...

360
00:35:17,428 --> 00:35:22,693
I I don't think I saw any kangaroo jumping over airplanes. When I was there. But...

361
00:35:23,191 --> 00:35:31,489
Yeah. They get... I I don't know. It'd be interesting to see how... I I know they can go at least, you know, six feet or so I've read they can jump just

362
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:34,766
incredibly far. Probably a lot higher. Yeah I've

363
00:35:35,145 --> 00:35:38,900
seen them jump pretty high, but I like... yeah, just like the image of, like,

364
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:46,569
flying airplane and it's jumping over. Right. Alright. So we transition to the the Ducktales kind of

365
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:49,366
already having tried for a while

366
00:35:49,825 --> 00:35:50,325
to

367
00:35:50,704 --> 00:35:54,094
trap her. You know? They have obviously been Al it

368
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:59,344
they explained that it's really hard to catch her snare and pits don't work.

369
00:36:00,302 --> 00:36:04,049
One of the Nephews is citing through some bin. He sees

370
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:07,806
her on a rock some miles, a mile away

371
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:16,245
watching what they're doing, which is how she knows what's going on. And he says that she looks sad, but I can't tell whether she's weeping or laughing.

372
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,546
It's really interesting to me that, you know, Barks has created this like really interesting

373
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:29,186
animal character here. Right? And this is definitely an animal. This is not one of the human, like, the people

374
00:36:29,644 --> 00:36:30,144
characters.

375
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:39,554
So she... She's an animal who's feeling this sorrow. It's it's there it's some interesting path though some some

376
00:36:40,189 --> 00:36:42,067
to this. Yeah. It gives us... Well,

377
00:36:43,386 --> 00:36:47,482
and even just the name more more info, Mary gives... Yeah. It's...

378
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:58,627
You know, it gives the gives her an extra layer of depth. That's it's kinda nice. It's not just doing it. It doesn't like I like that aspect of it because it's not implying that Kangaroo

379
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:08,418
in their nature in their nature to go and just terror things, you know, get she has a reason for it. She's trying to find her baby. Right. It's retribution or something.

380
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:12,063
She's very... I find her very sympathetic.

381
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:14,215
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.

382
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:16,008
And and so Donald

383
00:37:16,906 --> 00:37:21,280
recalls. He remembers, so that that's the reason that they do call her more

384
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:28,974
because she lost her baby. So that gives him an idea. He drives into town for something. And he yes the nephews used to cover one of the

385
00:37:29,274 --> 00:37:33,146
pits. With some brush. And I like the line from the nephew.

386
00:37:34,364 --> 00:37:39,912
Just I wish Shank Mcdonald wouldn't get ideas that would get ideas that didn't make so much work.

387
00:37:41,087 --> 00:37:47,939
And then they see him come back. They see his car, but it's actually a kangaroo driving the car, so they think

388
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:57,654
Yeah. A couple of things here. I don't know if you noticed the steering wheels on the incorrect side of the car there for Australia

389
00:37:57,994 --> 00:37:58,814
driving vehicle.

390
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:03,949
I didn't. I loved... I I love the gag of the kangaroo driving the car back

391
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,109
that's just another... Just a great...

392
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:09,589
Good Al little visual bag.

393
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:12,669
And also like and they've got what looks like maybe,

394
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:16,661
like ten foot pit for a kangaroo that just jumped over, you know,

395
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,519
flying airplane.

396
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:22,334
Right. We don't think about that too hard. Don't think about that too much.

397
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:30,189
So they they leap at the the kangaroo. They call them an uber overhead grasshopper or a great little line.

398
00:38:31,203 --> 00:38:37,515
You know, ask what did you do with our uncle? And then Donald reveals that it's actually him in this disguise.

399
00:38:38,768 --> 00:38:45,941
Saying that, you know, since she's lost her own, baby, she might want to adopt one. He's gonna stand on that pit and look very

400
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,079
very sad.

401
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:48,314
And

402
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:53,947
hope that she takes the bait and crashes into the into the pit.

403
00:38:54,406 --> 00:39:02,712
And they they watch him from a distance. They note that he's putting on a great act because, you know, he is Al experienced kangaroo now.

404
00:39:03,651 --> 00:39:04,990
And one of the Nephews

405
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:07,044
sites mourn Mary,

406
00:39:07,664 --> 00:39:09,924
spotting him through the bin,

407
00:39:10,664 --> 00:39:14,399
and I like her reaction shot where she's like, very surprised.

408
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:17,539
Had a a little lost baby kangaroo.

409
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:27,865
Yeah. This is... So I find it... I find it interesting that Donald, who has recently been h baptized into thinking, he's a kangaroo

410
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:29,476
his first

411
00:39:30,172 --> 00:39:32,027
plan of action is to

412
00:39:32,723 --> 00:39:34,318
become a kangaroo. U.

413
00:39:34,836 --> 00:39:37,743
Like maybe there's some residue effects that are still lingering.

414
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,410
He's still feeling Al. Like, I I still kinda wanna be a Kangaroo.

415
00:39:42,185 --> 00:39:43,164
And I'm also...

416
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:45,197
I think it's really

417
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:51,403
convenient that the station happened to have a kangaroo costume and his size too that.

418
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:53,740
Yeah. I don't like think too deeply about that.

419
00:39:57,385 --> 00:39:58,283
That's true.

420
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:03,039
Yeah. Alright. So on the next page, we cut

421
00:40:03,499 --> 00:40:10,489
to mourn Mary's perspective for most of it. And she's like, squeaking excited and hopping over to him.

422
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:18,744
Donald feeling very confident and triumphant, but, you know, she stops her jump a little bit short. She's sniffing.

423
00:40:19,677 --> 00:40:22,691
Suspiciously at the pit as Donald watches on easily.

424
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:33,554
And then we see her kind of take a big wind up. And just zoom straight across the pit, grabbing Donald by the head. Join.

425
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,947
Yeah. Shocking the Nephews,

426
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:40,235
She stuffs him in in her pouch

427
00:40:41,214 --> 00:40:48,444
and and bounds off with Don calling out for help and and she's got little cartoon hearts around her head.

428
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:55,379
And I just... I loved that sequence. I thought it was whole area. His look of surprise.

429
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:04,547
He shouldn't have been surprised there and this was very predictable to the reader, but it's still whole hilarious. And I love it. It's one of my favorite parts in the story.

430
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:06,701
Yeah. Yeah. It's

431
00:41:08,155 --> 00:41:09,373
it works a little too

432
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:11,305
bait anyways.

433
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:12,419
Yep.

434
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:15,895
Alright. So Donald

435
00:41:16,314 --> 00:41:17,992
kinda straps in for his ride.

436
00:41:18,831 --> 00:41:19,710
He can't get out.

437
00:41:21,161 --> 00:41:24,212
Miles, you know, she goes miles into the bush

438
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:31,764
with Donald getting stressed. And the Nephews are in a pretty bad situation because they have to take off in pursuit of him,

439
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:32,921
and

440
00:41:33,498 --> 00:41:36,884
they don't really have a ton of water, but they they can't

441
00:41:37,544 --> 00:41:41,024
they have to follow him while the trail is fresh.

442
00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:44,564
And, you know, we start to get

443
00:41:44,984 --> 00:41:45,484
more,

444
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:46,224
like,

445
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:51,419
detail of some of the wildlife and some of the scrub looking

446
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:52,619
Flo

447
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:54,679
of the Australian bush.

448
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:55,713
And

449
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:56,951
then

450
00:41:57,728 --> 00:42:01,061
I don't know if you got to hear much of this in the previous

451
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,942
episodes, but know, Barks used a lot of older national geographic features

452
00:42:06,797 --> 00:42:11,574
has, like, reference for a lot of these stories. And and so to my eye, he's

453
00:42:12,194 --> 00:42:13,494
gone to some care

454
00:42:13,794 --> 00:42:17,874
to depict some of the Australian outback. What what did you think of this?

455
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:20,348
Yeah. Everything,

456
00:42:23,084 --> 00:42:33,234
everything... I mean, you know, Australia, a lot of people don't realize his land mass wise is the same size as the United States. And so they're pretty clear. They do have a... They do have a pretty

457
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:37,005
wide, you know, their ski resorts in Australia.

458
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:38,084
There's,

459
00:42:38,662 --> 00:42:38,862
you know,

460
00:42:39,701 --> 00:42:44,930
it's not all outback, but the... Part has a mediterranean climate I've heard?

461
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:50,219
Yeah. And there's the northern territory that's actually tropical. And so they're... you know, they're

462
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:53,219
but the outback which they specifically,

463
00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:58,659
you know, the the bushes and the color of the dirt and the rock formations all seem

464
00:42:59,574 --> 00:43:03,154
even just the the design of the the sheep station.

465
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:04,474
Yeah. Everything

466
00:43:05,094 --> 00:43:05,594
looks

467
00:43:07,348 --> 00:43:07,848
it

468
00:43:08,584 --> 00:43:09,820
looks in place to me.

469
00:43:10,698 --> 00:43:15,922
Yeah. I I really like these outback vaccines scenes. I I thought they looked really cool as a kid.

470
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:17,554
Yeah.

471
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:18,870
So

472
00:43:19,328 --> 00:43:25,269
finally, Mary stops and Donald takes his chance to jump out and he immediately takes off

473
00:43:26,047 --> 00:43:26,547
but

474
00:43:27,364 --> 00:43:33,012
there there's a great line. He now when I need to be a kangaroo, no hit distance around.

475
00:43:34,243 --> 00:43:39,786
And then he he Nick... He references her. He says back off, you gallo brief case.

476
00:43:40,305 --> 00:43:43,655
I like these sort of nickname names for the kangaroo.

477
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:47,005
But he he takes off the costume.

478
00:43:47,384 --> 00:43:50,880
He reveals that, you know, he's not a kangaroo, and he kind of

479
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:55,814
confronts her, and she grabs him and puts him over her

480
00:43:56,354 --> 00:43:58,894
and paddle him like an naughty child

481
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:02,620
And he's he's realized that,

482
00:44:03,236 --> 00:44:06,687
you know, she loves him in a mother way

483
00:44:07,304 --> 00:44:09,614
regardless of what he is at this point.

484
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:19,077
And he... By the end of this, he says, well, looks like I'm adopted, but how will I get away? Yeah. It's kinda interesting. It's like you know, the moms like, you know,

485
00:44:19,536 --> 00:44:24,244
okay. It cost... At first, I'm like, well, in these cartoons, the mom, you know, when you dress

486
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:32,729
up bugs bunny dresses up as a girl bunny or a girl version of whatever, you know, thing and they fall in love anyways and

487
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:38,009
yeah. I think, you know, there there's just a void that was left when she lost her baby and even though

488
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:40,029
this isn't her baby. She's like, you know what?

489
00:44:41,005 --> 00:44:43,964
You're my baby now. Yeah. She's in full on gosh.

490
00:44:45,285 --> 00:44:45,785
I'm

491
00:44:46,565 --> 00:44:49,077
it's we're in this. Alright. So

492
00:44:49,494 --> 00:44:52,645
this is kind of a sequence that makes me feel hot and thirsty.

493
00:44:53,921 --> 00:45:01,181
We cut to the nephews on the next page, still tracking them. It's it's a pretty rough tracking because there's so many kangaroo tracks.

494
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,035
They just know that mourn was heading west so they keep going that way.

495
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:09,938
They have to eventually camp out in in a dune.

496
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:12,528
There is a random little sequence

497
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:17,608
panel where there's kind of visual of the moon with the personified

498
00:45:17,946 --> 00:45:18,446
face

499
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:31,350
looking at them. And again, this is kind of out of character for Barks he doesn't do this too often. But he did it in the previous story as well and ghost of the g. And and looks worried. Yeah. Yeah. It definitely does.

500
00:45:32,245 --> 00:45:40,125
And then kind of in parallel way, Donald having a rough time. Mourn Mary's is eating some grass. He's feeling hungry he pines for some chop to.

501
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,589
And she she makes him eat grass

502
00:45:43,925 --> 00:45:57,190
and she's just got a very stern maternal look. So he's gotta do it. I like the the panel a lot where he's trying to to choke down that grass. And oh oh well. Maybe it's full of vitamins. Yeah. He seems very...

503
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:05,405
know, like he said, passive. Like, he... Like, I don't know. Maybe it's just because he was... Some of the h digitizing is still wearing off because worries he's

504
00:46:05,983 --> 00:46:12,627
Al little bit. He's still eight percent kangaroo. Yeah. He's willing to go he's it. He's always just long for the ride.

505
00:46:14,257 --> 00:46:16,991
So Al at night, on the next page at nighttime,

506
00:46:17,568 --> 00:46:20,875
she's fallen asleep, so he has the chance to sneak off

507
00:46:21,692 --> 00:46:22,192
and

508
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:25,779
he he heads off, although he doesn't know in what direction.

509
00:46:26,474 --> 00:46:31,654
And by morning, you know, the nephews have woken up and they're they're looking pretty rough. They're

510
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:38,053
wandering off through the bush. And, you know... This is incredibly dangerous. Right? Like

511
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:42,541
in in real life, you're pretty much dead if you don't have a good supply of water out here.

512
00:46:43,419 --> 00:46:45,596
And and so we cut back to Donald

513
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:49,442
also in a rough patch. He's walking past some

514
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,177
clumps of grass,

515
00:46:52,455 --> 00:46:56,645
hearing some what he thinks to be owl hoo sounds

516
00:46:57,265 --> 00:46:58,765
and seeing some vicious

517
00:46:59,065 --> 00:47:05,220
spines poking out of them and in his state. He doesn't realize that it's bush. It's aboriginal,

518
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,395
watching him very men seemingly. I like the panel with the bushes with the spears

519
00:47:11,973 --> 00:47:15,547
be kinda trying to match the the little thing sticking out of the bushes.

520
00:47:16,005 --> 00:47:18,461
Right. Alright. So the Nephews

521
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,257
are approaching

522
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:26,590
pile a big mound of rocks and they see a kangaroo ahead that turns out to be more

523
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,005
weeping again

524
00:47:28,622 --> 00:47:29,521
So they figured

525
00:47:29,898 --> 00:47:34,863
that Donald has escaped and, you know, I'll take a moment to feel pretty bad for more

526
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:45,021
losing another child there. And so they track down pull their their uncles tracks, which they find but they see some

527
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:47,473
footprints also

528
00:47:48,052 --> 00:47:51,568
converging and they can see where he has been captured.

529
00:47:52,128 --> 00:47:55,425
And and so they they run off after him

530
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,319
emo the fact that he's gonna be eaten by cannibal.

531
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,520
And then we cut to Donald

532
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:02,880
surrounded by the aboriginal

533
00:48:03,474 --> 00:48:04,934
they're using some pretty

534
00:48:05,474 --> 00:48:07,015
bad pigeon speed

535
00:48:07,515 --> 00:48:08,575
saying that he's...

536
00:48:08,954 --> 00:48:19,336
He looks hungry. He needs to be fe up and Donald understands that there's only one reason for that. Well, you know, that... So maybe maybe I'm wrong here, but I feel like he

537
00:48:19,794 --> 00:48:21,651
intentionally avoided directly

538
00:48:22,084 --> 00:48:31,796
stating that they were going to eat him. It's Donald the only one who mentions that they mentioned that he's skinny and that he will make a fine prize

539
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,650
But I I haven't seen any indication that they're actually

540
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:42,453
trying to kill him or eat him that comes directly from them. I and I think maybe he did that

541
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:43,410
intentionally

542
00:48:43,906 --> 00:48:46,935
to... It's it's implied but not directly stated.

543
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:50,450
Right. You think maybe there's some ambiguity.

544
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:59,374
I... That's a very generous reading. I like that you're being generous but you know, there there are gonna be a few more stories

545
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:04,559
coming up that also have some of these, like, savage

546
00:49:05,215 --> 00:49:05,450
depict.

547
00:49:06,347 --> 00:49:15,201
This is one of the realities of a lot of great comic creators of this time. Right? Like, I... I'm not trying to call out Carl marx here.

548
00:49:16,575 --> 00:49:29,890
You know, I've seen like twenty thousand leagues under the sea from Disney and Swiss family, Robinson that they have these kinds of depict of savages in the movies. Go and and U dare in the Asterisk

549
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:36,381
comment, ten ten, you know, the tin ten comment. So like, I'm not trying to pick on Barks specifically.

550
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,059
But unfortunately,

551
00:49:38,598 --> 00:49:44,110
he's got these really timeless freight stories that are are marred by

552
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:47,830
by some of these depictions. And like this is

553
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:55,588
something that American society was really interested in at this time. Yeah. See it all over the place. It's just that his stories have held up.

554
00:49:56,005 --> 00:50:06,251
So we we end up having to compare them to media from today where where we should be comparing it to other stuff of its time and just kind of understanding

555
00:50:07,401 --> 00:50:08,300
But we do

556
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:11,890
recognize that, you know, these these are not great depictions.

557
00:50:12,707 --> 00:50:13,406
We do

558
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,994
as you know, they they mentioned, you know,

559
00:50:16,793 --> 00:50:17,692
prize at the,

560
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:24,692
which is a fun term. I I'm... I learned that in second grade during our unit on our Australia. It's like the big

561
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,408
aboriginal festival.

562
00:50:26,746 --> 00:50:30,059
Oh, yeah. I attended one when I was there. Awesome. How was that?

563
00:50:30,937 --> 00:50:32,509
We didn't have Ducktales.

564
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:33,568
I think it was

565
00:50:34,187 --> 00:50:34,687
sandwiches.

566
00:50:35,106 --> 00:50:38,802
Oh, good. Yeah. Yeah. It was good it was really it was really

567
00:50:39,181 --> 00:50:39,860
cool to see.

568
00:50:40,553 --> 00:50:42,824
Right on. So Donald, you know,

569
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,600
understandably is freaking out and he tries to escape

570
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,160
This is our obligatory bank.

571
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,560
This is our obligatory

572
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:53,520
boomerang

573
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:54,460
season.

574
00:50:56,073 --> 00:50:59,250
Can't not have it can't visit Australia.

575
00:51:00,189 --> 00:51:02,567
Without a character not understanding

576
00:51:02,946 --> 00:51:04,980
how boomerang works. And,

577
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:25,579
you know, I guess they make make some effort. Barks makes some effort to to not make it look like it does that magic go forward and back. You can you can see some of the arc that a real boomerang has. Right? Oh, yeah. It doesn't do the direct one eighty. And verizon an Barks to it. So on one quick bit of Boomerang trivia.

578
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,154
Yeah. There are different types of boomerang rings. That and they actually

579
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,474
use boomerang rings for hunting birds

580
00:51:33,775 --> 00:51:44,969
and the primary purpose, they they had two types of boomerang rings. They have the standard side kind that you see and the purpose was to not hit the birds with these ones, but it you would throw it

581
00:51:45,429 --> 00:51:54,705
around the birds and it would scare the birds towards you. So then you have a whole flock of birds instead of you trying to hunt them and them flying away from you.

582
00:51:55,637 --> 00:52:03,435
It it gets behind him, makes them all fly towards you. And they had another style of Boomerang rings that was shaped kinda of like a nike symbol

583
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:04,804
that they

584
00:52:05,263 --> 00:52:05,862
called... I don't know.

585
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:14,359
Person has told me about him just called Him killing william Boomerang where they were just blunt... They didn't... They didn't have any arc to them. They were just blunt and

586
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:18,594
you threw them and they just go straight and they they would kill the birds.

587
00:52:19,293 --> 00:52:20,232
That makes

588
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:22,284
immensely more sense

589
00:52:22,864 --> 00:52:28,124
then, like, the the the the arc to scare Barks towards you. That makes so much

590
00:52:28,584 --> 00:52:32,449
kinda stupid. Scrooge them towards you. Yeah. Yeah. It's really And the,

591
00:52:33,026 --> 00:52:33,185
you know,

592
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:37,484
imagination that Americans and I I think probably a lot of other

593
00:52:37,823 --> 00:52:52,298
have of how boomerang work. Right? Because, like, what's the point of something that comes back to you? Obviously, if you strike something with it, it's just gonna fall with a cla. So anyway, they used it correctly here to bring a bird closer to.

594
00:52:53,115 --> 00:52:54,014
That's true.

595
00:52:56,044 --> 00:53:03,914
So Donald does have a pretty good pit line after the boomerang does bring him down. He says, and I'm the guy that said there was no excitement in this country.

596
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,465
So on the next page, the nephews

597
00:53:07,003 --> 00:53:12,790
have gotten to the point where they can see smoke coming from what they assume must be the bush camp.

598
00:53:13,803 --> 00:53:15,779
And they approach Don

599
00:53:16,197 --> 00:53:17,735
where dawn been captured.

600
00:53:18,592 --> 00:53:21,739
We cut back to the camp where the aboriginal are

601
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:23,914
offering him some food.

602
00:53:24,633 --> 00:53:27,368
He looks at it and he says it's scorched

603
00:53:27,826 --> 00:53:28,424
screeching Al

604
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:35,999
Al owl, I think our west or a yeah, Al an American thing, but whatever. It's a fun sink gag.

605
00:53:36,815 --> 00:53:39,907
He's... They recognize he's American and we're trying to make him so.

606
00:53:40,499 --> 00:53:40,999
Sure.

607
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:44,033
And we see it. It's a pretty gross looking

608
00:53:44,451 --> 00:53:44,951
pet.

609
00:53:46,008 --> 00:53:56,857
So he doesn't like that. So they offer him what he identifies as wizard and for whatever reason Barks doesn't show that that's kept off the panel. Yeah. I'm wondering if

610
00:53:57,529 --> 00:54:05,994
is too morbid to think about eating an animal that isn't generally depicted as food. Yeah or he didn't know... Maybe he didn't have a good reference

611
00:54:06,414 --> 00:54:08,035
photo for Australian lizard.

612
00:54:08,775 --> 00:54:12,115
Says Donald, you know, is again, he's

613
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:16,329
upset and he must up the strength to try and escape.

614
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:21,010
This time, they say they're gonna pin him with a spear. He throws back the boomerang

615
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:26,224
and then by the next page, you know, it's gonna come switch back and he's gonna accidentally

616
00:54:26,644 --> 00:54:39,004
subdue himself Alright. So he's he's good and caught and we transition to the to that night where the nephews are spying at the edge of the camp. One of the Nephews is looking at

617
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:42,715
a large bird roasting over the fire.

618
00:54:43,053 --> 00:54:46,226
And the first time I read this I remember being pretty

619
00:54:46,538 --> 00:54:47,437
wondering If feel.

620
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:52,382
But the the other nephew clarifies for him, that... That's an e.

621
00:54:53,517 --> 00:54:54,735
In case you're wondering,

622
00:54:55,512 --> 00:55:06,319
reassuring him and this is one of the few times that were made to think of about donald as like a bird instead of a human. I think. It really kinda it is jarring.

623
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:11,779
Yeah. When he's looking at the dead, the screeching, and then you've got this roasting e.

624
00:55:12,932 --> 00:55:13,831
Yeah. Yeah.

625
00:55:14,249 --> 00:55:16,425
Exactly essentially very weird.

626
00:55:17,321 --> 00:55:17,821
So,

627
00:55:18,638 --> 00:55:22,862
you know, as they sneak into the camp, they hear someone breathing

628
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:30,693
maybe a... A century hiding in the grass. So one nephew those to knock him out and barely stops himself before

629
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:31,530
striking

630
00:55:31,947 --> 00:55:32,447
bound

631
00:55:32,944 --> 00:55:36,316
donald. And they they release him, and,

632
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:39,187
you know, this is another of those

633
00:55:39,819 --> 00:55:47,209
awkward moments where he says do thank goodness, those blacks state to me out here, so the police wouldn't find me.

634
00:55:47,904 --> 00:55:51,204
I don't think that's meant to be like as

635
00:55:51,624 --> 00:55:59,269
as it sounds, but, you know, obviously, it doesn't sound great. This is one of the few times that I hear him kind of reference anything like that.

636
00:55:59,868 --> 00:56:01,286
You know, the...

637
00:56:02,502 --> 00:56:07,605
Most of the versions that I met they refer to other aboriginal as black.

638
00:56:08,023 --> 00:56:10,855
And so I noticed these the word fella here a lot too.

639
00:56:11,548 --> 00:56:18,574
Right And that that is a common term and to use the the word black over there while I would never refer to them

640
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:24,248
Right that way, they... That is a common way that they refer to each other you know, even.

641
00:56:24,987 --> 00:56:39,740
I I also noticed to. I didn't even notice when I first read this the e cooking on the spit when actually the way that they cook kangaroo, and Al they build a pit and the a fire pit on the ground, and then they bury the car

642
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,314
in the ground on the ashes and then we'll leave it for about six hours.

643
00:56:44,688 --> 00:56:51,173
And then they'll dig it up and then skin it and everything cooked like that. So sounds a lot more efficient. Alright. So

644
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:52,962
the the Ducktales

645
00:56:52,962 --> 00:56:58,003
have a pretty rough night in morning because they have to make as much distance between themselves.

646
00:56:59,136 --> 00:56:59,636
And

647
00:57:00,068 --> 00:57:14,939
I'm just gonna read these couple lines. One in the f says, we've we've come miles and miles. Can't we stop and rest a while. Donald says no, we don't dare those bush men or best trackers on earth and they must be on our trail by now. And, you know, this was

648
00:57:15,317 --> 00:57:36,285
a little more respectful. Right? Because that is something that the aboriginal are are known for it. Yeah. Definitely. And and this this this next page has a just an agonizing sequence that again makes me feel so hot. And first every time I read it, they kinda pull over to a rock to use up their last

649
00:57:36,782 --> 00:57:40,487
water rations because Donald hasn't had a drink since yesterday.

650
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:52,074
They... The nephew looks in the canteen. There's a single drop left and donald generously poor on the product and cuts it half ways. It's it's very funny.

651
00:57:52,814 --> 00:57:53,514
It's also

652
00:57:54,374 --> 00:57:55,994
very very uncomfortable.

653
00:57:56,469 --> 00:58:00,569
Gag. What was that... What was that cartoon where they slice a bean?

654
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:10,697
Oh, yeah. A single bean divided equally and that in in Mickey beans stock. That's right. He's... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I reminded. That's right.

655
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:19,284
Of that. And was the son made contrast to the moon who the moon seemed worried, but the sun he's enjoying this

656
00:58:19,904 --> 00:58:22,004
Yeah. It's pouring down the beat.

657
00:58:22,504 --> 00:58:23,684
Yeah. That's a personified

658
00:58:24,024 --> 00:58:24,524
sun.

659
00:58:25,784 --> 00:58:38,187
The water and they keep walking and, you know, there's some pretty cool art in this panel here where you're behind them looking over their shoulders and you can see some heat waves rip in the distance.

660
00:58:39,161 --> 00:58:44,857
Yeah. I almost feel like this panel is inspired by Air rock where you've got just

661
00:58:45,353 --> 00:58:45,853
it's

662
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:57,176
out right in the middle of Australia and there's just everything flat for miles and miles. You can't see any mountains or hills. And then Air rock is this giant. What do they call now though it's been renamed to, like,

663
00:58:58,453 --> 00:59:15,808
I think? I didn't... I wasn't aware they renamed it. It's not called Airs rock anymore. Right. I I think it was the... I think it was named for the tribe. Yeah. Yeah. I could see that. Is kinda reminiscent of it. And again, it's just looking worse and worse for the depths. They've got scavenger eagles following them.

664
00:59:16,467 --> 00:59:19,005
We see that the aboriginal are

665
00:59:19,399 --> 00:59:25,059
tracking them. The rocks they notice are the ones seemed to be the ones where they saw more,

666
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:31,066
which means they're only one day's walk from the station. So maybe they can make it. But unfortunately,

667
00:59:31,522 --> 00:59:35,945
they turn their shoulder over their shoulder they see that the bush are only one minute.

668
00:59:36,998 --> 00:59:42,572
So they have to make a break for it on the next page here. And as they pass the rock,

669
00:59:43,431 --> 00:59:48,024
mourn Mary is there she observe them. She squeak

670
00:59:48,364 --> 00:59:48,864
excited.

671
00:59:49,364 --> 00:59:51,944
A bunch of cartoon hearts come out of her.

672
00:59:52,644 --> 00:59:54,557
The the ducks are bracing

673
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:57,588
themselves for to to be spear.

674
00:59:58,005 --> 01:00:00,179
But just then, of course, mourn

675
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:04,423
leaps in as they throw their spears.

676
01:00:05,002 --> 01:00:08,978
Donald gets in their pouch. The boys climb on their back, and

677
01:00:09,557 --> 01:00:11,775
Donald tells her home, mama.

678
01:00:12,249 --> 01:00:15,426
So he's definitely leaning in here. I and I like that whole

679
01:00:15,924 --> 01:00:20,100
concept when you have... Because this one doesn't really have a, you know, an antagonist

680
01:00:20,654 --> 01:00:29,924
directly. It starts off as more from marion so I like the... I like the shift when they introduce the second group and then, you know, the original antagonist.

681
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:32,557
Comes in and saves the day. It's so... Yeah.

682
01:00:32,976 --> 01:00:41,164
You're right. There's no real villain in this one. Right? I mean, the aboriginal are more like Al a force of nature They're more like a force nature.

683
01:00:41,664 --> 01:00:45,824
They're... And I... I'm still standing by it. I don't think their plan was to eat them at all.

684
01:00:46,398 --> 01:00:48,275
Alright. They hadn't... They already had a new.

685
01:00:49,193 --> 01:00:49,592
Know, I mean,

686
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:53,884
I think they were honored guests. He looked hungry. He's trying to feed him.

687
01:00:54,462 --> 01:01:01,019
And now the only reason their attack because they're because they're calling the cops, you know, they don't want them to snitch on them which I wouldn't either, you know,

688
01:01:02,016 --> 01:01:04,050
sure. You're you're really going bat for them.

689
01:01:05,406 --> 01:01:06,559
Al out. It.

690
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:10,679
So on the next page, you know, they're they're making great time

691
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:14,679
by Kangaroo. They figure out that they can kinda steer Mary

692
01:01:15,874 --> 01:01:26,430
and they get back at the station where they were trapping, one big leap over the fence and they unfortunately land right in one of their pits

693
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:33,041
and and they're all stuck unless someone finds them and when they call help the

694
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:48,525
the station manager comes and they're able to show him that mourn Mary is is with them now. And, you know, you mentioned that it's pretty ridiculous that this know small pit. You know, I changed my mind though because he she was fresh.

695
01:01:49,341 --> 01:01:57,212
She was fresh. When she jumped over the plane. She's been carrying Donald and three other ducks and they've already shown how hot it is out there. Yeah.

696
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:11,848
She's probably just tired. That's true. She also landed, like, in a, way she didn't expect. Right? So she is like oh or something. She attacked a bunch of bush, You know, She's had she said kind of a That's been emotional day. You know.

697
01:02:12,346 --> 01:02:14,362
And so the station manager

698
01:02:14,741 --> 01:02:18,927
does what station managers do. Right? He's sees the opportunity.

699
01:02:19,864 --> 01:02:20,923
He prepares

700
01:02:21,261 --> 01:02:21,761
to

701
01:02:22,099 --> 01:02:22,958
shoot her,

702
01:02:23,337 --> 01:02:26,764
but the Ducktales protest, you know, she saved their lives

703
01:02:27,184 --> 01:02:28,842
she needs to go free.

704
01:02:29,701 --> 01:02:30,520
He protests.

705
01:02:30,939 --> 01:02:36,168
I can't let her go free she's wrecking my crops and I'm paying you a thousand pounds. And Donald

706
01:02:36,707 --> 01:02:37,606
very virtuous

707
01:02:38,105 --> 01:02:44,134
says that he doesn't want the reward then he'll keep Mary so that she can go free.

708
01:02:44,514 --> 01:02:54,469
The station manager uses an American. He says you've made yourself a deal and we transition to them on a ship randomly named the ss asthma.

709
01:02:55,369 --> 01:03:09,199
Failing from Sydney to to the Us. Say, the docs are feeling great. We transition to the fact that Donald is where he always is. He's got a big crowd around him go at the duck riding around in

710
01:03:09,499 --> 01:03:38,595
mourn mary's, I guess, not so more in full anymore or less more full in her pouch, he says, I don't get tired. I don't find her attire some pet. I do get kinda tired of riding around in her pouch several hours a day to keep her happy. And she does indeed look very happy. So nice sweet little ending there. Yeah. You know, I think I'm standing by the... He's a still a little bit h. He he wants. He wants to be in her pouch. She wants to be a kangaroo

711
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:40,329
it's un

712
01:03:40,869 --> 01:03:43,649
of from what I've seen from Don to just turn down

713
01:03:43,949 --> 01:03:45,409
that large amount of money

714
01:03:45,949 --> 01:03:46,689
to saver

715
01:03:47,364 --> 01:03:51,815
Yeah. I think it's still... you know... No. It's his cover story you think dwindling

716
01:03:52,552 --> 01:03:53,052
effects

717
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:54,729
of the H h.

718
01:03:55,067 --> 01:03:55,665
Yeah. Well,

719
01:03:56,479 --> 01:04:00,376
you know, it's it's a very sweet ending to a pretty weird story.

720
01:04:01,394 --> 01:04:03,932
We can talk in in a moment about...

721
01:04:04,551 --> 01:04:15,548
Yeah And you know what? Let's go right into tell me, tell me Ben. What how did you feel about this story? I know that you're new to this, but I know that you did read a couple of other stories kind of in preparation. Yeah.

722
01:04:16,126 --> 01:04:19,660
Yeah. You know, I I like just seeing the...

723
01:04:20,118 --> 01:04:22,654
Like you mentioned that just the art artistic

724
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:36,683
depiction of Australia. It's kind of interesting to see, you know, we think of our current tropes and everything that we think of about Australia and stereotypes, but kinda... So it's kind of fun to see a little snapshot

725
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:45,515
before we had some of the stereotypes we have now. I mean, they're still kangaroo. They're still Boomerang rings and the things that we just don't have here.

726
01:04:46,371 --> 01:04:54,143
So... yeah. I thought it was a little bit different. The characters are different than the way I remember. I just seem like hue Dewey and Louie were

727
01:04:54,877 --> 01:04:59,002
kind pointless. They the only real purpose they served was

728
01:04:59,712 --> 01:05:33,461
when he was tied up, and they finally they did on tie him, but, you know, like I see, like, Donald did all the work here. He was the one coming up with the traps. He was the one that dressed Al the kangaroo and I don't know. Maybe I'm remembering it wrong, but I always felt like it was like Donald getting into trouble and they were always the one solving things and they're in the in the terror and the swamp one. I mean, they did... you know, they did a whole bunch of problem solving. Whereas this one, they just kinda were walking. The whole time. They i really think you're right. Right? They're they're usually a lot more resourceful than this. It's kind of more

729
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,633
that's kind of in that secondary.

730
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:37,432
Yeah.

731
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:41,707
And so so maybe they just kinda had to step aside for them to

732
01:05:42,685 --> 01:05:54,073
allow this more mary to have her story Barks, you know. And yeah. No. It was... I I enjoyed it It didn't go where I was expecting it too. You kinda have to ignore some of the bush stuff obviously.

733
01:05:55,328 --> 01:05:56,188
But Yeah.

734
01:05:56,765 --> 01:05:59,818
You know, for the time, I guess it could've have been worse.

735
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:02,644
There wasn't any kind of...

736
01:06:03,004 --> 01:06:12,237
There always seems to be some type... But I guess they h known this part of it like a... I don't know. Some like, a hyper concept hi. Yeah. Hi concept. You know, they're just kinda out in the bush.

737
01:06:12,955 --> 01:06:17,985
So I guess they have aspect of it kinda of filled that. But... So it's a little bit diminished he just kind of like,

738
01:06:18,757 --> 01:06:19,257
Australia.

739
01:06:19,674 --> 01:06:32,864
Right? Was was sort of a high concept in this one. Yeah. I guess maybe that's it. Because I'm so familiar with Australia. It's not as a high concept. So maybe that was enough for the time to for for them. But... So yeah there's a little different...

740
01:06:33,584 --> 01:06:42,932
Characters acted it a little bit different than the way I remember him, but... Yeah. It was kind of fun. I like that. Yeah. You know what? I I really liked this one as a kid. I remember...

741
01:06:43,671 --> 01:06:55,664
It was one of the earlier comics that I had gotten. And so I read it a lot and I definitely still enjoy it, but I don't enjoy it as much as I did. And that's not just because of the stereotypes,

742
01:06:56,002 --> 01:07:00,092
although that certainly is is a part of it. It's it's a very unusual

743
01:07:00,685 --> 01:07:03,865
story, right? This, like, kind of motherhood

744
01:07:04,525 --> 01:07:05,625
story. Almost.

745
01:07:06,525 --> 01:07:09,265
It's got some some kind of weird structure

746
01:07:09,699 --> 01:07:14,109
I really like certain individual parts of that. I love the h

747
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:28,137
sequence. I love how he kind of launches the story. I feel like the pacing is a little bit unusual. Yeah. I think he does a really effective job of making the outback feel Frightening and dangerous.

748
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:34,355
So, you know, we we talk about the index rating. Right, which is the community

749
01:07:34,732 --> 01:07:35,405
website that

750
01:07:35,984 --> 01:07:46,128
people have submitted user reviews for many years. So it gives us a really good aggregate for what the community thinks for this one. And this one, I mentioned

751
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:58,032
at the outset, this is an incredibly highly rated story. This one has an eight point five out of ten. And if you think about, you know, hundreds people rating it. That means like almost universally,

752
01:07:58,411 --> 01:08:13,779
they're giving this very high ratings, very few little ratings to pull it down. This is the ninth best rated, not just out of the like five hundred plus Barks stories, but all of the Disney comics that might really. Yeah. So

753
01:08:14,395 --> 01:08:26,450
I I I respect it. I think this is a really cool story. You know, it's got some neat, like sadness. I think the the creation of mourn mary is really cool. Her like, relationship

754
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,310
with Donald is neat.

755
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:54,166
I I don't quite get why this one is as highly rated though as it is. Because I do think it's a very fun different unique adventure story, but it didn't stick with me the way that some of them. But, I think Australia itself has a mass appeal no matter what country you're in. It's a it's a unique place. And so they might they might be tacking on their own internal

756
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:00,340
fascination with Australia as to why they like this story. And i just see how it would have my.

757
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,800
Yeah. Yes. Exactly. Some of those titles from around the world,

758
01:09:04,414 --> 01:09:16,323
But again, this is maybe one of those cases where, like, hundreds of Ducktales fans can't be wrong, and maybe I'm... Maybe I'm missing something. I I do like a lot of this story. Right? I just...

759
01:09:16,662 --> 01:09:18,599
I just wouldn't put it

760
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:30,388
anywhere near the top. Yeah. So five red three, and I wouldn't put it in the top of the threes that I've read so far. Right. But is enjoyable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't I don't want

761
01:09:30,886 --> 01:09:40,781
harp. Because again, as a kid I did really really love this. I do still really like it. But I just stack it next to like, we just read ghost to Leg.

762
01:09:41,254 --> 01:09:48,319
And in the same issue to me that one is is quite a bit superior, but different rooms. Let's see

763
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:56,534
other reflections, you know, we've already kinda talked about some of the data Barks k things. I don't feel like we need to go to into it. We know what's

764
01:09:57,034 --> 01:10:03,314
retro grade and and what's problematic. I did find it interesting to see Australia before the opera house though.

765
01:10:04,394 --> 01:10:14,842
Fine Yeah. As far as I'm aware, we talked about if there's been any appearances in other media. I'm not aware of him using any any of these characters again or

766
01:10:15,473 --> 01:10:21,241
or any other comics creators using them he didn't make any of his oil paintings

767
01:10:21,619 --> 01:10:23,854
about this story from my knowledge.

768
01:10:24,549 --> 01:10:27,029
I did think it had some pretty good educational Al

769
01:10:27,869 --> 01:10:29,929
just because it did have some

770
01:10:30,349 --> 01:10:30,849
interesting

771
01:10:31,469 --> 01:10:32,349
Australian terms.

772
01:10:32,804 --> 01:10:47,136
And I feel like the outback was pretty well depicted. Oh, yeah. The some Australian things they don't quite get the scale of it. Right? And the just even little things like the fact that they took a plane from Sydney to the to the station

773
01:10:47,834 --> 01:11:02,825
you know, like, yeah, you would do that there's not very many things that are within driving distance in Australia. I I feel like he does a good job of capturing the scale of it. Awesome Oh, I don't wanna leave out our favorite panel segment.

774
01:11:03,923 --> 01:11:09,432
Ben, did you have any panels that came to mind as as a contender for your favorite.

775
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:17,357
You know, there's a few, you know, artistic. I liked the the character design of the the h,

776
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:20,507
Yeah the the clerk at the travel agency

777
01:11:20,925 --> 01:11:26,742
and the... I didn't care much for the the Australian, you know, sheep station owner.

778
01:11:27,477 --> 01:11:29,292
See how the characters really good.

779
01:11:30,505 --> 01:11:34,090
You know, I I went through and I was looking and I like the

780
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:38,210
design of the cooked bird. I really wish I could have seen the lizard.

781
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:47,410
There aren't really any the other ones I've read definitely have some favorites, but I I kinda lump... I love this the rock formations

782
01:11:47,908 --> 01:11:49,060
art style of just

783
01:11:49,718 --> 01:11:51,493
I kinda lump a lot of the...

784
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:52,729
Just to outback

785
01:11:53,266 --> 01:11:54,045
the artwork.

786
01:11:54,462 --> 01:12:00,882
There's one I'm looking at now with rock formation with creepy old tree with the ultra

787
01:12:01,301 --> 01:12:05,595
purse on the top. Oh, yeah. That is a good one. I I just like how every

788
01:12:05,949 --> 01:12:06,449
frame

789
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:30,089
without back just kinda has interesting looking bushes and hills and it's not flat. It just everything it looks like it just has a lot of depth to it and layers to it. I think I feel like they took a couple shortcuts because there's a lot of panels where there's just do silhouette work. Are all the comics, just this detail from one panel to another because there's quite a bit of detail. Yeah. I mean know. Spark does is is known for

790
01:12:30,587 --> 01:12:33,975
detail, especially in these early comics. There will be some later ones where

791
01:12:35,633 --> 01:12:44,499
cuts back a little bit. He's also known for doing those silhouette. And sometimes it might be a little bit of shortcut. But sometimes I think it's done for that effect. I'm noticing

792
01:12:45,437 --> 01:12:55,501
whereas I didn't, when I was reading these more casually, going through these chronological, I'm taking note of all that silhouette stuff he does. And I with you. There's some pretty awesome

793
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:01,469
scenes from the outback in this. Yeah. There aren't as many, like, really show panels in this

794
01:13:02,249 --> 01:13:19,054
Right? There's not a not a time like some of the other issues. If I had to pick one, you know, hold the spear to my head and pick one, I would probably pick the one the one with the the email... Not there the E roasting, the one above that one where they're just perched over.

795
01:13:19,709 --> 01:13:23,449
Looking at the camp below. Oh, yeah. The ne user. It's the...

796
01:13:23,789 --> 01:13:38,335
Just because there's some cool lighting there. Yeah. You're you're absolutely right. There's some gray lighting in So something else just pick one of those two frames with the... There's two frames there with the dynamic lighting that just looks pretty cool. I agree. Those are really nice.

797
01:13:38,988 --> 01:13:49,752
I think in the absence of a really show panel, which, you know, I'm usually a set for. I really like the panel that shows him h demonetized and crying

798
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:50,631
thinking

799
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:51,729
about his.

800
01:13:52,489 --> 01:13:54,327
I I think that pretty awesome.

801
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:59,317
The one of the scavenger eagle also pretty cool. Yeah. Awesome.

802
01:14:00,255 --> 01:14:04,849
Alright. Well, Ben, thank you so much. I hope to have you back for more of these.

803
01:14:05,423 --> 01:14:09,672
Yeah. This is fun. Alright. So... Yeah. A really really good adventure.
