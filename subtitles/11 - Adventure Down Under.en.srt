00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:48,545
publishing or order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks.

3
00:00:49,437 --> 00:00:54,442
Hello, and welcome back to Barks remarks. I am still Barks sever,

4
00:00:54,978 --> 00:00:57,330
still a grown man who enjoys donald dot com.

5
00:00:58,182 --> 00:00:59,040
I've managed

6
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:02,069
to khan yet another friend into

7
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,996
letting me talk about comments with him.

8
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,810
We have a first time guest today.

9
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,410
If you can introduce yourself, please.

10
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:19,165
Hello. My name is Ben Johnson. I'm a big comic nerd, but not as big as smart. And yeah, I'm excited

11
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:23,580
to talk about donald Ducktales. Is one of my favorite Disney characters.

12
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,315
Excellent. The bend, do you have any experience with the Karl Barks

13
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:30,595
stories at all?

14
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:47,900
No. Not really. I, you know, introduced to watching Donald Cartoons when I was younger and, you know, duck when i was whenever that was on the Disney afternoon stuff. Yeah. Those were great. Right. And and Ducktales was, of course, based on many of the Barks stories.

15
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:49,572
But

16
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,623
he actually did work on a lot of those early Inducks

17
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,083
cartoons

18
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:57,895
too before he transitioned over to doing the comment.

19
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:00,402
Excellent. And

20
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:03,231
we are here to discuss

21
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:05,462
adventure down under

22
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:08,355
which is kind of the mandatory

23
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:11,355
Australian four a. The

24
00:02:11,895 --> 00:02:14,050
sort of every Tv series or

25
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,370
every adventure series has to have the Australia

26
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,350
episode. Right?

27
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:31,437
Yeah. You know, it's pretty unique place. And so you can't really have where adventures take place and not do Al an Australian episode or issue. Right. And and we've been... We've been around the globe where just about,

28
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,190
I think ten

29
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:40,697
episodes in, and we've been along the The mississippi River. We've been egypt, we've been in the West Indy indies.

30
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:42,890
We've been all over the place. So

31
00:02:43,307 --> 00:02:47,848
Al lot of fun globe t in the Carl Barks stories, you actually

32
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:49,959
spent some time in Australia

33
00:02:50,415 --> 00:02:54,195
yourself which is a big part of why I wanted this to be your first

34
00:02:54,773 --> 00:03:00,859
episode. Yeah. Yeah. I'm very familiar with Kangaroo, and I was there for two years out in the bush. So

35
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:12,385
I was pretty much went through all the same things that Donald went through here. So... Yeah. You you to get to be in the Al less less populated part Yeah. Yeah. Alright. So

36
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:17,105
let's go into a little bit of the overview about this issue.

37
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,996
Again, adventure down under is

38
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:32,469
from July of nineteen forty seven. This one was published in four color one hundred and fifty nine, which is the same issue that

39
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:33,440
our last

40
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:41,183
episode. Our last story, ghost of the g was in, and that one had the cover story or the cover art rather,

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,473
but it's it's kind of

42
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,304
note notable, I think that these two

43
00:03:46,642 --> 00:04:03,793
major and very well remembered stories were originally published together. That's not something that happens all the time. It has, of course, been reprinted many many times. I first read it in donald Ducktales adventures number eleven Barks I think in nineteen eighty nine. This one is twenty five pages,

44
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:19,045
and new to the podcast, I've decided that I should be having our guests offer up our brief synopsis of the story before we go into the narrative later. So ben. Let's hear it. What is this story about

45
00:04:19,423 --> 00:04:25,745
Oh well, you know, it starts off just like any adventure they're sending Al home, trying to think it's something like fun to do. They

46
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:30,786
walk out of the street and come across a hip test. Which I think all good story

47
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,800
start by people getting ties.

48
00:04:33,758 --> 00:04:40,265
Donald gets hepatitis into thinking he's a kangaroo and filling homes sick So he's they find a way to

49
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:41,105
Australia

50
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:41,985
and

51
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:43,305
meet a

52
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:46,585
kind of a shady character with a mustache

53
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:49,234
sends him off hunting kangaroo,

54
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:51,547
and there's some aboriginal

55
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:58,155
and all kinds of of hygiene and sue. Yeah. Lot lots of very Australian elements.

56
00:04:58,855 --> 00:05:08,330
And we'll we'll talk about. I I I like that I've got you on and I can ask you, you know, how true some of this stuff rings? Oh sure. Yeah. Thank you for that.

57
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,944
So a little bit of sort of background Trivia.

58
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,254
I mentioned already that this is the b story

59
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,266
that was after goes to the g.

60
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,930
This is the second story that we've done that is

61
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:30,843
rated in the top fifty and is actually our first to be top a top ten rated story already end up. Which will go into a little bit more.

62
00:05:31,202 --> 00:05:34,060
Another new thing that I'd like to do now

63
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,896
starting this episode, I... I've noticed when doing research

64
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:44,550
that these stories, the titles get translated in kind of a variety of ways around the world,

65
00:05:44,930 --> 00:06:04,902
and this one seem to have a particular they're particularly wide number of titles. So I wanted to just talk about what some of those were because I think it's fine and I like to try to wrap my wrap my mouth around saying things in languages that I don't speak. Well probably not very successful But in Brazil, this was called I was a kangaroo

66
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:05,859
or

67
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:07,813
fu kangaroo

68
00:06:08,191 --> 00:06:10,086
in France. This is

69
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:13,117
the generic Donald in Australia. Don't.

70
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:17,636
In Germany, this is Australian adventure

71
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:19,249
throughout, Al,

72
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:24,488
I think. In Italy, it's Kangaroo Hunter Al

73
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:25,746
Dick.

74
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:27,462
Mexico

75
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,109
is Australian Adventure Ventura, They are Australia.

76
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:32,108
Netherlands

77
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:32,987
is

78
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,745
Adventure in the

79
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,063
or Ave

80
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:39,020
b did

81
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:39,914
he.

82
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:46,058
And then in Spain, it's different than Mexico. It was y.

83
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:48,029
I was a kangaroo.

84
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:50,826
Another bit of trivia,

85
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:55,821
the Just on that too, I wanna add if the down under

86
00:06:56,974 --> 00:07:01,834
probably doesn't have... They're they're down under to us, but maybe in Brazil

87
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:02,914
down under...

88
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:03,794
That's

89
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:11,832
like, a little bit to the left over. And I like say. Yeah. They don't I I would imagine that the... That's probably the reason for

90
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:14,703
changing it in some of those languages and countries

91
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,021
Alright. Is that something that... I I think they do refer to themselves is being down under. Right?

92
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,663
Yeah. I mean, they're familiar with it I don't think they refer to themselves

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,300
as being down under, but they are aware that Americans refer to them because they're not down under to themselves. Right. Right.

94
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:33,533
Making.

95
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah. I mean, and and America has gone through, like, it's Australia

96
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:38,958
fascination

97
00:07:39,295 --> 00:07:40,029
Right. Or like,

98
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:47,789
he's with crocodile done and everything anything. And I imagine it must be kind of infuriating. Well, it's kinda interesting to see something in the context of, you know,

99
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,264
for Steve Irwin and

100
00:07:51,365 --> 00:08:01,039
Crocodile Dundee Movies because... Yeah. I think if this had taken place after, maybe it would have a character like that in here. But we don't have that stereotype yet.

101
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:15,125
It's true. I think this must have been fairly early in the, like, fast fascination with Australia. Right? Because this isn't the late of, and I can't think of a lot of media that is that sort of oh american in Australia

102
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,844
from that era. I I also found it to be notable that the

103
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:24,792
the app originals in this were among the very first human

104
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:25,804
characters

105
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,173
that Barks has drawn.

106
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:30,587
So far. You know, he doesn't usually

107
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:52,502
characters as like humans he he depicts him as, like, a dog nose usually. And and we'll talk about, you know, there there certainly problems with their depiction but they are sure. Unlike most of the background characters, they're actually those humans. Yeah. It is... I haven't thought about that. I i mean, when I was a kid, I remember thinking... Because there's regular

108
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,256
animals in the in this universe.

109
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:57,452
And they're different from the ant

110
00:08:58,244 --> 00:09:05,164
animals in it. And I I wondered about that. Yeah. And when I bring people in in for the these newbie,

111
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:17,778
slots like urine. This is always one of the things that they get focused on. Right? Like are these? Are these animals are these? Any answer is they're Huey,. You know, like, they're there people...

112
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:20,330
They're duct people on dog people,

113
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:22,563
and we only occasionally

114
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,465
think about the fact that they're also animals. And I guess this story is one of those rare times too.

115
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:33,220
Alright. So for the value range of this one,

116
00:09:33,794 --> 00:09:37,890
The highest documented sale was seventy five hundred dollars

117
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:38,729
for.

118
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:54,384
Yeah. Nine point six rate. Which is the same Mh. As it was last episode. Right? Because this is from Ghost. This has the same is in the same comic as ghost of the garage. So we're gonna launch now into a little bit of

119
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:59,888
one of my favorite parts the the background where we talk about some historical and geographical

120
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:00,345
context.

121
00:10:01,437 --> 00:10:08,021
Again, we are in nineteen forty seven right now, and I think that American

122
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:15,281
Attitudes from about Australia we're probably not the same as they are today. Right? It was probably

123
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:23,217
regard as much more remote and, you know, I I think we get a taste to that when, Donald talks about how now it civilized.

124
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:27,661
And I think there was this feeling that until recently, it hadn't been civilized.

125
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,237
Yeah. It's probably, you know, once

126
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:37,075
air travel has become like, because I mentioned air you know, few travels there by playing and, you know, and

127
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:38,567
yeah, That that...

128
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:45,860
That was weird and I can't remember where it was when it meets that stranger with the mustache. It seemed out of context like comments about

129
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:57,251
civilized. I was... See I couldn't quite follow what they talking about. Yeah. And, you know, it's one of the things that I think is the tone for a lot of these stories is that idea of civilization

130
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:58,169
but

131
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:01,243
it also makes for some very interesting

132
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:18,148
and adventure stories. Yeah. For, you know, they for children and in in viewing things with a sense of like, civilization versus something worth exploring and I give them a little lay leeway just to seem a little bit more interesting No ben. These stories are

133
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:19,663
year old

134
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:22,035
having a podcast.

135
00:11:22,855 --> 00:11:26,274
Oh i clearly. Yes. Yes. Absolutely fully

136
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:27,435
we we

137
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:29,569
these are our

138
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:33,276
stories and fact Rx has put so much

139
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:40,671
care into them, but I think they've been so well remember. I... It comes up to me, because when I read this, that's one thing I've been...

140
00:11:41,210 --> 00:12:13,854
Especially this app issue is it's brought to the forefront I can tell a Carl Barks He's he's very good at almost like Calvin and Hobbs where it's an adult, but it tells us story from the perspective of a child. There's so much media content that we see now you can tell it's adult trying to write things for children. But you can tell he has a way of making it almost seem like it's from a perspective of a child. Yeah. And and I think... And he never talks down. Yeah. Yeah. Even a little bit. And and sometimes, some of that's just an effect of

141
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:18,890
you know, in the forties and fifties, like, kids, there was kind of a different attitude

142
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:24,539
about childhood, and kids were more independent, so some of that stuff is kind of jarring. But...

143
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:27,987
But it's great that he never never Barks down. Yeah.

144
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:29,364
Definitely

145
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:46,849
So for for the background to me, one of the natural things to this on is this just the idea of the kangaroo as the national animal of Australia. And, you know, I think one of the really striking things in this comic is the depiction of them as pests.

146
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:50,789
Right? I think I think if you're familiar with Australia,

147
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,769
that

148
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:52,924
is like,

149
00:12:53,803 --> 00:13:06,909
very logical. Right? Yeah. I imagine you have some experience with that. But I think to most Americans when they first read it, It might be jarring to think about their, like, iconic animal as a pest. Yeah. They're

150
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:12,658
I I wouldn't put them exactly in the same category as a pest. I guess I don't mean like a pest, like,

151
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:22,201
but but kinda like in the in the same vein as deer for America. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the main the main risk, there was a a small village I was living in that was...

152
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:26,128
If you or it's about a three hour drive that I would do pretty regularly

153
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:59,574
for one little town to another town. And if you go at Don or desk, You can't go five miles without seeing a, you know, Barks kangaroo and and they they have the tendency to just stand on the edge of the road and and this look like twitch look in their eyes, like, I'm am not gonna jump. Can I jump? And I think they they think that they can jump over the cars. They're ability to judge how fast they're going and and so it's they're they're a danger for people driving those roads. And they even have... They have... And they install these things called Barks that comes out of the grill and it goes

154
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:25,869
up above the driver side and sometimes on the passenger side. And it basically... So it just kinda tears the kangaroo and half to either side of you. Rather than going through the windshield and killing it because they jump right before impact going right through the windshield instead of hitting the bumper. So it's They're not... So not really a pest, and they don't go in and, you know, in this in the comic, they're tear they're going in and ruining the crops and you know, they're doing some things that cares, you know, don't really do. They...

155
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:29,624
And I read a little bit that maybe they don't terrorized

156
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:34,692
props in this way, but I I think that there have been periods

157
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,385
based on my reading. Correct me if I'm wrong.

158
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:46,601
Where, like they are a a real menace to to her ranch and to agriculture when they've been Al their, like, over populated kia.

159
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:53,169
Yeah. By the time I was there, population control wasn't really Al issue mainly. Mainly just

160
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:54,048
dangerous

161
00:14:54,467 --> 00:15:08,898
for people driving down the roads. Right. Yeah. And I I know. I read that they have, like a calling quota where they there's a certain number of them that are allowed to be killed because they do try so to manage the population. Yeah. They

162
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:16,209
friends with some aboriginal people there. And apparently, the aboriginal are allowed to hunt them and they actually just

163
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:25,981
go and you you'll go camping and they'll... And I actually went camping with them a few times and you'd literally just sw over the side of the road and they see one pull out rifle,

164
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:26,874
and

165
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,138
just shoot one and put in the back of the pickup truck, and that was our dinner.

166
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:32,294
One there...

167
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:38,339
Is kangaroo meat. It's Well, you can go to the grocery store. You know, we didn't have a lot of money there. So

168
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:46,508
I was like, oh, this is way cheaper than ground beef for my spaghetti. So it it's definitely an it's really gaming. Not not very good, but if you have enough

169
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:49,041
pasta sauce to it, you know?

170
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:58,174
And then the last thing to say about kangaroo is something that, like, everyone knows at this point, but it kind of bears saying that the the pouch

171
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,764
never works the way.

172
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:04,339
Works the way that they depicted in the cartoons.

173
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:08,415
It's a lot go. Right? It's doesn't is the other

174
00:16:08,849 --> 00:16:11,903
background in this that, you know, is is Al little less

175
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:23,333
fun to talk about is the depiction of of the app originals. Right. Like... And I was really interested it by because, you know, you have to acknowledge right away that it's it's a it's a clearer,

176
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:26,959
you know, they're using that pigeon speed. They're depicted is Al,

177
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,299
I think, long past

178
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,019
when that

179
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,739
would have been a concern.

180
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:42,107
I I read a little bit about it and and from what I can tell, there's no greater incidents of cannibalism

181
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:45,079
in Australia compared to, like, any other

182
00:16:45,658 --> 00:16:46,158
indigenous

183
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:47,196
society

184
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:48,435
around the world.

185
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:56,513
So, that's unfortunate. But the that interesting thing to me was it looks like he went out of his way to, like, visually

186
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,463
depict them at least somewhat accurately.

187
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:05,058
Yeah. I mean, it takes I mean, obviously the character troy or the over

188
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:06,572
characterized

189
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,166
depiction is a little

190
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:13,250
problematic, but it's They have the dot... The dot style artwork

191
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:15,007
on their bodies,

192
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:26,654
which you do see an original artwork is that, you know, the the... I don't know. There's a word for it I can't remember, but it's where they, you know, represent instead of lines. It's through dots, there's

193
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:31,894
snakes and lines that... You know, it's close. It's it's as good as someone

194
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:37,869
right. Expect from somebody in the forties to do. Right. I'm I'm sure it's like mixing elements.

195
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:39,869
But the thing is that it really

196
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:51,285
contrasts with just like, their look is a lot more accurate than, like you know, I think the sort of savage way that he fix them. It... Yeah is kind of a mixture of different things.

197
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:56,888
There's a... We have a boomerang. You gotta have a boomerang. So that's that's it's a good story. Yeah. Alright.

198
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:04,824
As far as notable appearances go, we have more full mary, I would say is the most notable one. We don't have any

199
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:20,392
characters that are gonna go on to be reoccurring And then I've been talking about kind of the version of of the hero that we get. And what's interesting. I I call Donald in this passive Donald. Right? Because throughout this whole story, he's very

200
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,230
compliant.

201
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:29,779
He's just kind of long for the right. Right at the very beginning, the kids are able to just really easily convince him to go and make patient.

202
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:37,279
He immediately gets baptized in a passive way. He he gets quickly pressed into bounty Hunting kangaroo cruz,

203
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:45,465
And then, you know, he's extremely passive when he's taken by first by more full Mary, and then buy the originals,

204
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:51,659
and then again, i'm more full married. So, like, he's always just kind of being passive, and he's always at someone else's

205
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,599
command or, you know,

206
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:59,629
control in this language which was in striking to me. I mean he was advertised. He was.

207
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:01,326
Yes. So Yeah.

208
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:08,533
Alright. So are you ready to go into the actual content of the story? Well, let's do it.

209
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:10,072
Alright. So

210
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:11,710
adventure down under

211
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,641
opens up with

212
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:16,514
the... Just kind of a very boring

213
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:28,043
sedentary life Donald than the kids. At home. You know, donald is there's a really nice site gag right away in the very first panel where Donald just reading boring Ducktales

214
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,760
by Inducks blow hard,

215
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:31,338
looking very.

216
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:38,859
And the kids are asking him if they can't take a vacation before their school starts up again. And un

217
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:40,299
Donald

218
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:45,499
agrees right away and says that they should enjoy some time in Catalina

219
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:52,194
Island off coast of California. Right? I think that was a much more popular vacation

220
00:19:52,494 --> 00:20:02,475
site once upon a time. I don't know. I lived in California for many years and never made it out there. At any rate, Donald grabs some of their savings and they go to get

221
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:07,877
some airline tickets and they... And they pass by a outdoor

222
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:09,513
radio station

223
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,667
broadcast where someone

224
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,635
the the radio and announcer or Dj is introducing a professor

225
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:23,524
with one of those great Barks ian names Argo Gi i. And this professor Gi is going to him

226
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:31,215
a volunteer from the crowd. And he's got a great sort of generic mystic accent and says how do?

227
00:20:31,993 --> 00:20:33,371
Then, what do you think of

228
00:20:33,909 --> 00:21:01,874
esther? Barks kim with I there? So first of all, that's, I love his depiction with his fur brow. Like, he... I I'm kind of hepatitis just looking at him. Okay. His eyes just pull me in. And like, I'll I'll I'll become a kangaroo if he tells me too. Yeah. He's got that top hat and a bow tie, but, man, that and hence looked on his face. He was really born for the job. And I have to say I... That... Like I... Like I mentioned earlier about

229
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:04,586
understanding how kids see the world. I

230
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,295
site guy in the beginning...

231
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:08,391
I I feel like all kids

232
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:12,560
see books that adults read as having that having titles like that.

233
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:26,587
I see that it's like... That's it was hilarious. I mean. I I guess actually laughed out loud. Because a caught off guard when I saw that Donald was reading a book called boring tales. I also just just like you said, looking at the professor

234
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:28,819
very.

235
00:21:29,236 --> 00:21:30,733
Yeah. That's just a great

236
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:36,605
it it's exactly what I would imagine somebody in the forties would look like who people on.

237
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:38,969
Excellent. So

238
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:44,797
On the next page, Donald, and the kids are approaching and they they hear that whoever

239
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:47,484
volunteers to get him ties, can expect

240
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:49,003
ten dollars.

241
00:21:49,542 --> 00:22:02,296
A nice little line here ten dollars and cool cream cash definitely sounds like, you know, an old tiny dj would say that. And Donald is, you know, he's seen that as spending money in Catalina. So he volunteers.

242
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:09,153
And and we get a a really cool and weird panel here where we get fate

243
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:10,487
personified.

244
00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:13,777
Right? And and kind of buying and w

245
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:15,907
and just

246
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:40,914
fore foreshadowing for us the donald, you're going to be sorry. It it trails off. Yeah. That could've took me have threw me off. I And i had to read it, like, three times I'm like, is that? I've never seen faith fade always is depicted Al like, yeah, This is the way things are going, but fate seems like said that this is the way things are going. Yeah. Interesting. And this is a very unusual panel. I think he doesn't he didn't do this very often. So...

247
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:59,101
There was some similar stuff in ghost of the g where it was very over. And that just might have been what he wanted to experiment with that that month. But I really like. So Donald is super eager with the the radio Dj. He's anticipating his every question answering what his name is

248
00:23:00,054 --> 00:23:03,354
ahead of time that confirming he's never been h ties.

249
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:04,234
So

250
00:23:04,814 --> 00:23:06,074
the Dj

251
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:09,969
sets it up and, you know, ponder, what, what is he gonna

252
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:14,689
hepatitis him into is he gonna make him a dog or a monkey or a sea going ground?

253
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:16,984
And we get to see

254
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:25,129
Donald being put into a trans the professor. It's a the kind of depiction you would expect a little jedi mind trick.

255
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:26,309
And

256
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:28,749
there. Yeah. He's got the little wavy fingers.

257
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:34,900
Classic ge. But we get a great he give... He hits donald with a du.

258
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,078
He tells him you are a kangaroo

259
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:47,449
and you are very very home sick. And what, you know, what a great great way to set up an Australian adventure story, I think.

260
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:48,824
Right. Like

261
00:23:49,164 --> 00:23:51,704
Alright. So the the last panel in this page

262
00:23:52,244 --> 00:24:05,650
has the Nephews observing and the and the crowd observing donald whim and crying and he's posture, like the kangaroo. It's clearly worked out really well. Yeah. I don't know. I find it odd that the humid would add the home sick part.

263
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,282
Because I don't feel like that would add much

264
00:24:08,941 --> 00:24:18,359
entertainment value. It's almost like he's... He wants him to just go to Australia. Right? He's gil lily a little bit there. And but I think

265
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:35,375
maybe he's playing to the radio audience, you know? Yeah. But I I just... I love the setup for this. Alright. So I like the dotted lines going for their eyes and gives just limp arms, like Huey, He's he's definitely there. Yep. So on the next page, we see him

266
00:24:35,794 --> 00:24:44,620
acting like the Homes kangaroo that he believes in himself to be. The the Dj is really selling it. It's talking about him acting homes sick and

267
00:24:45,078 --> 00:24:47,855
facing the west to smell

268
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:51,003
sniff at the air and dream of far off

269
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:55,095
Australia. As you mentioned, he refers to it in the far off and.

270
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,332
I think

271
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,894
is just means the, like, bottom half of their earth, but

272
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:01,169
or or the

273
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,321
inside of.

274
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:08,601
I had to look at. It's like that region of New Zealand and Australia.

275
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:11,755
Donald has a thought balloon of him

276
00:25:12,173 --> 00:25:20,951
crying and thinking about kangaroo like him. That's a great panel right there. I love that panel. It sums it up. And all of a sudden, he

277
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:25,917
bounds off with a happy look in his face stunning the crowd, the hi

278
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:44,049
professor can't get in contact with him because he's too far away, and he is bounding off much faster and higher than you should be able to. And, you know, the nephews are worried the hi says it should wear off in a few hours, but who knows what could happen this is why we...

279
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:52,784
Most modern hip just make people find waivers because of stuff like this. That's right. On the next page, Donald bounds off to the

280
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:55,400
airline office to buy a ticket.

281
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,380
And

282
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,508
I I really like the fact that he is now na. He's got human speech. Even though he's a kangaroo.

283
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:06,863
He's saying, I'm a home kangaroo, and I know how to go home.

284
00:26:07,402 --> 00:26:10,714
And he explains this to the ticket seller.

285
00:26:11,092 --> 00:26:14,785
Who tells him oh, your home would be awesome kelly. Just a moment to.

286
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:19,256
And, you know, Donald very kindly

287
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:42,709
ask soon to make it four tickets so that his kangaroo nephews can come to. And the ticket seller completes the transaction for four hundred dollars. Didn't look up what that would be, but definitely sounds like a lot. And the Clerk wishes him well until he does a double take and and says gracious six, that wasn't a kangaroo. That was a person. Kangaroo don't have four hundred dollars.

288
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:53,284
I love the a joke was funny because it's the the money aspect of it. That was the part. Yeah. It was funny. There... Wait a minute. That's like saying,

289
00:26:54,419 --> 00:27:02,799
Don't have blue hats. Yeah. And I I remember even as a kid. I loved this interaction. It's just so ridiculous. And totally dis interested.

290
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:04,872
Clark, literally thinking

291
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:08,250
Because eyes are just barely open to sliver.

292
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:12,885
Alright. So on the next page, the nephews have caught up with Donald who beck

293
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:42,706
them to follow him and he leads them to what he calls the clipper base. I guess that's where these clipper plans take off. This is a pretty cool way to travel. It seems Well, Al rate, they they see him bored the os australia clipper, and they're freaked doubt they've gotta get him out, but he refuses. He says, home to kangaroo cruz is Australia and they asked the captain for help getting him out, but the captain like, why should I? He gave me four tickets to Australia?

294
00:27:43,465 --> 00:27:44,245
So the nephews,

295
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,166
Yeah. You know. Mean can't really beat his logic. He was given tickets.

296
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,723
Yeah. I I know. Very sound. Right. Alright. So the nephews,

297
00:27:53,618 --> 00:28:01,216
you know, they convene and they talk about the fact that, hey, Donald got tickets for all of us, so we get to go to Australia. Hours

298
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:21,562
pass, a really nice panel, nighttime panel of them descending. The Donald is the first of the Ducktales wake up. And, you know, he he looks out of the plane he's kinda coming too. He's wondering why he doesn't remember getting the catalina tickets and a flight attendant tells him to buckle the lot because they're about to land in Sydney, Australia.

299
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:38,359
Alright. So on the next page, Donald just realize what's going on and we don't see the explanation which is nice because we know what's going on. It just transitions to to later. And you know what I think is interesting here, we fly into, I guess, Sydney Harbor.

300
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:43,165
There's a lot of cloud cover there. So we don't really see a lot of the City skyline.

301
00:28:43,662 --> 00:28:48,187
And then the next panel just transitions to, like, a generic city. The only

302
00:28:48,539 --> 00:29:07,369
thing that really indicates that it's Australia is a poster for cricket matches. Yeah. It seems like such a gimme to, like, show, you know, the shorthand for Australia and Sydney Harbor is the opera house and I I realized that it hasn't even built at this time That was by first not too. I when I saw this. I was like, are they

303
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:24,127
just putting clouds there because They don't wanna draw it. And then I'm like, you know what? Maybe didn't exist yet. Know. Yeah. I looked it up. I I because this this brought me on hindsight, but but it was definitely later, I wanna say nineteen fifty seven is like when the planning commission got away. But

304
00:29:24,465 --> 00:29:26,562
there's not really a lot of other

305
00:29:28,178 --> 00:29:32,050
for here we're in Australia until you are in the outback. Right?

306
00:29:32,783 --> 00:29:36,211
Yeah. You know. It's it's the opera house and the the bridge there.

307
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:41,029
Yeah. You know, I attribute it. Well, I saw the bridge, and that's when I was looking for the upper house, but I

308
00:29:41,926 --> 00:29:45,217
I mean, yeah, there's not really any distinguishing

309
00:29:45,753 --> 00:29:46,253
features.

310
00:29:47,068 --> 00:30:07,420
So Australia rules football was from the people I knew there was a a bigger deal than than cricket. Maybe carl Barks didn't wanna get confused with Right. Because I don't think they call it A rules football there. They just called it the football. But. Yeah. That would be... So cricket he's like, alright. What do we... What do I got to work with here? And there's a

311
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:14,381
recognizable bridge and they play cricket there. Well, we'll we'll be in the outback soon, and and you'll be reminded constantly.

312
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:20,382
But for now, Donald is just g, you know, he's he's in a bad mood pretty understandably.

313
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:41,594
And the nephews are, like, come on, stop driving. Let's have some fun and, you know, this prompts Donald, i'll just say that you can have any fun in Australia. The country is too civilized. You know, which which seems like a weird thing to say. But I think it's just the setup, right? For us to meet this Yeah. This stranger with the pretty spectacular

314
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:45,249
mustache, and he is the one that makes the off

315
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:50,283
to the nephews. He he encourages them to come to his

316
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:51,282
station.

317
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,532
And his sheep station station being the term for ranch.

318
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,968
And the he'll pay them to hunt

319
00:30:59,707 --> 00:31:03,778
and, you know, Donald is like, pain me when you want me to hunt

320
00:31:04,475 --> 00:31:07,449
and we got a good faint thing ga where he says kangaroo.

321
00:31:08,346 --> 00:31:27,092
Yeah. I thought it was interesting that like, if there were some wild Inducks or or buffalo. I don't know some kind of native Australian and animal. Like, like it for forgets that us that kangaroo exist. I was confusing that he mentions his buffalo and he's looking for something interesting. But he literally was just hepatitis as a kangaroo

322
00:31:27,524 --> 00:31:32,464
then he gets here and, like, oh, if only, there was some kind of wild native animal

323
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:33,444
anywhere around here.

324
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:34,284
Exact.

325
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:36,156
And he's literally

326
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:38,867
describing, like, the American Frontier.

327
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:39,864
Right?

328
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:47,024
And so much American Media at this time was, like like fascinated by the American Frontier.

329
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:49,064
Right. Could you see all those western

330
00:31:49,364 --> 00:32:05,564
and stuff. So I think some of this is just kind of playing out Frontier fantasy in a different kind yeah. Well, I... Yeah. I I kinda after thinking about it a little more. I think they just wanted to in case we couldn't do it on our own because the whole concept of a frontier

331
00:32:05,984 --> 00:32:08,404
is something familiar, but maybe his readers

332
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:12,904
aren't familiar as much with Australia. So in one panel, it says,

333
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:17,112
wild Inducks and Buffalo and then the next panel, Bush

334
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:32,969
and hunting and then talking about kangaroo. So I think he just wanted to put those concepts side by side. Right. It's it's very Australia one zero one. Yeah. Yeah. I think they're link... Setting a table that maybe we don't really need these days, but they needed problem.

335
00:32:33,504 --> 00:32:38,993
Alright. So on the next page, you know, Donald recovers, and the man explains that

336
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:49,471
he will pay two pounds for every kangaroo that they bring in and five hundred pounds for more full mary, either dead or alive.

337
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:52,643
He explains that she is the queen of the kangaroo.

338
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,355
She lost her baby months ago and has been, like, leading

339
00:32:58,829 --> 00:32:59,329
kangaroo

340
00:32:59,709 --> 00:33:06,369
rating on Rancher pasture. And the Inducks decide, yeah, let's do it. We're gonna be kangaroo to hunters.

341
00:33:07,203 --> 00:33:09,379
They're gonna have some adventure and

342
00:33:09,996 --> 00:33:13,626
maybe make the five hundred pounds that they need to... I don't know, get tickets home.

343
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:22,893
So they they fly out to his sheep station. It's a pretty cool panel depicting the sheep foundation. The

344
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:24,688
station manager

345
00:33:25,386 --> 00:33:28,360
tells them where they can find kangaroo and he

346
00:33:28,698 --> 00:33:37,680
dives the plane down low. Scatter several dozen them so they can see how overrun with Kangaroo the area is. Yeah. That was

347
00:33:38,273 --> 00:33:40,885
one thing that stood out here is, you know, because

348
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:49,271
now they use dollars, that they they have Australian dollar. So they'd I was like, pounds, they don't use pounds there, but then I was remembering

349
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:49,809
Yeah.

350
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:53,461
They that they originally did use the British pound

351
00:33:53,774 --> 00:34:00,474
and I don't know when... So I guess when this was written, they probably did use pounds there. But they they just use the word dollars now.

352
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:11,650
Just like we do, but it's the Australian dollar. Right. Yeah. And I thought about that too. I didn't check when they made that transition. But as you say, some sometime after this story. Yeah. That's sheep.

353
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:14,042
Stations are pretty common there.

354
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:19,635
I spent some time out on some of these cheap stations. And, yeah, they the legitimately did pay people

355
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:21,525
you know, they pay them per

356
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:25,593
pay people to thin out the herd and just

357
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:33,994
when they get over populated. So that's not an uncommon thing back then. Right. Alright. So as they dive down, you know, they see

358
00:34:34,335 --> 00:34:37,369
they see kangaroo jumping over the wings up the plain

359
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,309
pretty fancy but little any little site visual.

360
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:47,223
And they land so that they can get to work. And the nephews point out

361
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,201
one of the kangaroo on top of the plane, and the station manager instantly

362
00:34:53,737 --> 00:34:57,729
recognizes it, as more info Mary who has, you know, a pretty

363
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:03,189
vicious looking Al on her face. She plants herself she jumps on his chest,

364
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:06,578
and hops away, and

365
00:35:07,115 --> 00:35:16,810
he is upping his anti. He he's up in the bounty out to thousand pounds reward for her high. Again, dead or alive. Yeah. And

366
00:35:17,428 --> 00:35:22,693
I I don't think I saw any kangaroo jumping over airplanes. I was there. But...

367
00:35:23,191 --> 00:35:24,011
Yeah. They get...

368
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:31,489
I don't know. It'd be interesting to see how... I I know they can go at least, you know, six feet. So... Have read i can jump just

369
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:34,766
incredibly far. Probably a lot higher. Yeah. I've

370
00:35:35,145 --> 00:35:38,860
seen them jump pretty high, but I like... Yeah. Just like the image of, like,

371
00:35:39,793 --> 00:35:46,569
flying airplane and it's jumping over. Right. Alright. So we transition to the the docs kind of

372
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:49,286
already having tried for a while

373
00:35:49,785 --> 00:35:50,285
to

374
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:53,900
trap her. You know. They have obviously been Al it.

375
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:59,304
They explained that it's really hard to catch her snare and pitt don't work.

376
00:36:00,302 --> 00:36:02,878
One of the nephews is siding through some.

377
00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:04,035
He sees

378
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:07,806
her on a rock some miles, a mile away

379
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:16,206
watching what they're doing, which is how she knows what's going on. And he says that she looks sad, but I can't tell whether she's weeping or laughing.

380
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,507
It's really interesting to me that, you know, Barks has created this, like, really interesting

381
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:29,147
animal character here. Right? And this is definitely an animal. This is not one of the human, like, the people

382
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,104
characters.

383
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,834
So She... She's an animal who's is feeling the sorrow. It's

384
00:36:36,254 --> 00:36:39,554
there it's some interesting path though. Some some

385
00:36:40,189 --> 00:36:42,067
to this. Yeah. Gives us... Well,

386
00:36:43,386 --> 00:36:47,482
and even just the name more more mary gives yeah. It's,

387
00:36:48,101 --> 00:36:58,587
you know, gives the gifts her extra layer of debts. It's it's kinda nice. It's not just doing it. It doesn't I I like that aspect of it because it's not implying that kangaroo

388
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,790
and their native in their nature to go and just

389
00:37:02,206 --> 00:37:08,379
things. You know, they get she has a reason for it. She's trying to find her baby. Right. It's retribution or something.

390
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:12,364
She's very... I find her very sympathetic.

391
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:14,255
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.

392
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:15,968
And and so Donald

393
00:37:16,826 --> 00:37:33,106
recalls, he remembers. So that that's the reason that they do call her more inform. Because she lost her baby. So that gives him an idea. He drives into town for something. And he asks the nephews to cover one of the pit. With some brush. And I like the line from the Nephew.

394
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:39,872
Just... I wish On Domino wouldn't get ideas that would get ideas that didn't make so much work.

395
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:47,939
Sure And then they see him come back. They see his car, but it's actually a kangaroo driving the car. So they think

396
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:57,614
Yeah. Couple of things here. I don't know if you noticed the steering wheels on the incorrect side of the car they're for Australia

397
00:37:57,954 --> 00:37:58,814
driving vehicle.

398
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:05,449
I didn't I love. I I love the gag of the kangaroo driving the car Barks

399
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,069
That's just another just great...

400
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:09,189
Been a little visual.

401
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:12,629
And like they've got what looks like maybe,

402
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:18,519
like, ten foot hit for a kangaroo that just jumped over, you know, Right flying airplane.

403
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:22,334
Right. We don't think about that too hon. Nothing think about that too much.

404
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:30,149
So they they leap at the the kangaroo, they call in an fed grasshopper, a great little line.

405
00:38:31,203 --> 00:38:34,479
You know, ask, what did you do with our uncle? And then Donald reveal,

406
00:38:34,918 --> 00:38:37,575
that it's actually him in this disguise

407
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:45,941
saying that, you know, since she's lost her own, baby, she might wanna adopt one. He's gonna stand on that pit and look very

408
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,079
very sad.

409
00:38:47,854 --> 00:38:48,354
And

410
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:53,766
hope that she takes the bait and crashes into the into the pit.

411
00:38:54,366 --> 00:39:02,672
And they they watch him from a distance. They note that he's putting on a great act because, you know, he isn't experienced kangaroo room now.

412
00:39:03,651 --> 00:39:04,950
And one of the nephews

413
00:39:05,424 --> 00:39:07,004
sites mourn full Mary

414
00:39:07,584 --> 00:39:10,084
spotting him through the bin particulars.

415
00:39:10,704 --> 00:39:17,499
And I like her reaction shot where she's, like, very surprised. I had a a little lost baby kangaroo.

416
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:25,507
Yes. This is... So I find it. I find it interesting that Donald who has recently been

417
00:39:26,006 --> 00:39:27,825
into thinking he's a kangaroo.

418
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:29,476
His first

419
00:39:30,132 --> 00:39:31,908
plan action is to

420
00:39:32,683 --> 00:39:33,582
become a kangaroo.

421
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:34,158
U.

422
00:39:34,796 --> 00:39:37,703
Like maybe there's some residue effects that are still lingering.

423
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,370
He's still feeling... Like, I I still kinda wanna be a kangaroo.

424
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:43,164
I'm also...

425
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:45,157
I think it's really

426
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:51,163
convenient that the station happened to have a kangaroo custom and his size too

427
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:53,740
Yeah. I don't like thing too deeply about that.

428
00:39:57,345 --> 00:39:58,283
That's true.

429
00:40:00,135 --> 00:40:10,450
Alright. So on the next page, we cut too mourn mary's perspective for most of it. And she's like, squeaking excited and hopping over to him.

430
00:40:11,584 --> 00:40:14,444
Donald feeling very confident in triumph,

431
00:40:14,784 --> 00:40:18,884
but, you know, she stops her jump a little bit short. She's sniffing

432
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:22,630
suspiciously at the pit as Donald watches on easily.

433
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:28,730
And then we we see her kind of take a big wind up and just zoom

434
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:33,794
straight across the pit. Grabbing donald by the head. Right talking.

435
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,907
Yeah. Shocking the nephews

436
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:40,155
she stuffs him in in her pouch

437
00:40:41,214 --> 00:40:48,384
and and bounds off with Donald calling out for help, and and she's got little cartoon hearts around her head.

438
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:55,259
And I I just... I loved that sequence. I thought it was whole hilarious. His of surprise.

439
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:04,587
He shouldn't have been surprised there. And this was very predictable to the reader, but it's still whole hilarious. And I love it. It's one of my favorite Barks in the story.

440
00:41:05,722 --> 00:41:06,121
Yeah. Yes.

441
00:41:08,155 --> 00:41:09,572
That works a little too well

442
00:41:10,508 --> 00:41:11,305
the bait anyways.

443
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:11,999
Yeah.

444
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:15,815
Alright. So Donald

445
00:41:16,314 --> 00:41:18,072
kinda straps in for his ride.

446
00:41:18,831 --> 00:41:19,710
He can't get out.

447
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:24,212
Miles, you know, she goes miles into the bush

448
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:31,724
with Donald getting stressed. And the nephews are in a pretty bad situation because they have to take off in pursuit of him,

449
00:41:32,461 --> 00:41:32,961
and

450
00:41:33,498 --> 00:41:36,884
they don't really have a ton of water, but they they can't

451
00:41:37,544 --> 00:41:41,024
they have to follow him while the trail is fresh.

452
00:41:42,505 --> 00:41:44,524
And, you know, we start to get

453
00:41:44,984 --> 00:41:45,484
more,

454
00:41:46,064 --> 00:41:46,144
like,

455
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:49,299
detail of some of the wildlife

456
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:51,419
and some of the scrub looking

457
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:52,579
floor

458
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:54,739
of the Australian bush

459
00:41:55,254 --> 00:41:55,754
And

460
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:56,911
then

461
00:41:57,728 --> 00:42:01,061
I don't know if you got to hear much of this in the previous

462
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,942
episodes. But, know, Bark used a lot of older national geographic features

463
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:11,574
Al, like, reference for a lot of these stories. And and so to my eye, he's

464
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,414
gone to some care

465
00:42:13,794 --> 00:42:17,994
to depict some of the Australian out outback. What what did you think of this?

466
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:20,348
Yeah. Everything

467
00:42:23,084 --> 00:42:23,584
everything...

468
00:42:23,922 --> 00:42:33,274
I mean, you know, Australia, a lot of people don't realize is land mask wise is the same size as the United States. And so they're pretty cool. They have a... They do have a pretty

469
00:42:34,108 --> 00:42:36,965
wide, you know, they're ski resorts in Australia.

470
00:42:37,544 --> 00:42:38,044
There's,

471
00:42:38,662 --> 00:42:38,862
you know,

472
00:42:39,701 --> 00:42:40,760
it's not all

473
00:42:41,314 --> 00:42:44,930
outback. But the... It has a Mediterranean climate that I've heard.

474
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:50,219
Yeah. And there's the Northern territory that's actually tropical. And so they're, you know, they're

475
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:53,179
But the outback, which they specifically,

476
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:58,659
you know, the the bushes and the color of the dirt and the rock formations, all seem

477
00:42:59,574 --> 00:43:03,194
even just the the design of the the sheep station.

478
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:04,434
Everything

479
00:43:05,054 --> 00:43:05,554
looks

480
00:43:07,348 --> 00:43:07,848
it

481
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,099
looks in place to me.

482
00:43:10,698 --> 00:43:15,922
Yeah. I I really like these outback. I I thought they looked really cool as a kid.

483
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:17,133
Yeah.

484
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:18,831
So

485
00:43:19,288 --> 00:43:25,269
finally, Mary stops and john... Donald takes his chance to jump out, and he immediately takes off

486
00:43:26,007 --> 00:43:26,507
But

487
00:43:27,324 --> 00:43:32,932
there there's a great line. He has now when I need to be a kangaroo. No hit and the distance around.

488
00:43:34,163 --> 00:43:39,747
And and he he nick... He references her. And he says back off, you gallo the case.

489
00:43:40,305 --> 00:43:42,121
I like these sort of

490
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:43,636
nickname for the kangaroo.

491
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:46,966
But he he takes off the costume.

492
00:43:47,344 --> 00:43:50,840
He reveals that, you know, you know he's not a kangaroo, he kind of

493
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:55,814
confronts her and she grabs him and puts him over her

494
00:43:56,354 --> 00:43:58,714
and paddle him like an naughty child.

495
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:02,580
And he's he's realized that,

496
00:44:03,236 --> 00:44:06,687
you know, she loves him in know a mother y way

497
00:44:07,264 --> 00:44:09,574
regardless of what he has at this point.

498
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:18,617
And he... By the end of this, he says, well, looks like I'm adopted, but how will I get away? Yeah. It's kinda interesting. It's like and know the mom's like, you know,

499
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:24,244
Okay. It cost... At first, I'm like, well, in these cartoons, the mom, you know, when you dresses it

500
00:44:25,343 --> 00:44:32,729
bugs bunny and dresses up as a girl bunny or a girl version of whatever, you know, thing and they fall and love anyways. And

501
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:37,969
Yeah. I think, you know, they're they're just a void that was left when she lost her baby and even though

502
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:40,029
this isn't her baby. She's like, you know what?

503
00:44:40,964 --> 00:44:43,864
You're my baby now. Yeah. She's in full on

504
00:44:44,204 --> 00:44:44,704
mode.

505
00:44:46,565 --> 00:44:49,037
It's we're in this. Alright. So

506
00:44:49,494 --> 00:44:52,685
this is kind of a sequence that makes me feel hot and thirsty.

507
00:44:53,921 --> 00:45:01,181
We cut to the nephews on the next page still tracking them. It's it's a pretty rough tracking because there's so many kangaroo tracks.

508
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,035
They just know that more formula mary was heading west so they keep going that way.

509
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:09,858
They have to eventually camp out in a in a dune

510
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:12,528
there is a a random little sequence

511
00:45:13,104 --> 00:45:17,089
panel where there's a kind of a visual of the moon with the

512
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:18,446
personified face

513
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:31,310
looking at them. And again, this is kind of out of character for Barks he doesn't do this too often. But he did it in the previous story as well and ghost of the g. And it looks worried. Yeah. Yeah. It definitely does.

514
00:45:32,245 --> 00:45:43,368
And then kind of in parallel way, Donald having a rough time, more mary eating some grass. He's feeling hungry. He pines for some chopped to we. And she she makes him eat grass,

515
00:45:43,925 --> 00:45:57,190
and she's just got a very stern maternal look. So he's gotta do it. I like the the panel a lot where he's trying to to choke down that grass and, oh, oh well maybe it's full of vitamins Yeah. He seems very...

516
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:05,405
Yeah, like you said passive. Like, he... Like, I don't know maybe it's just because he was some of the advertising is still wearing off because where he's

517
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:12,906
little bit. He's still eight percent kangaroo. Yeah. He's willing to go use it. He's always just along for the ride this.

518
00:46:14,217 --> 00:46:20,875
So at at night on the next page at nighttime, she's fallen the asleep, so he has the chance to sneak off

519
00:46:21,732 --> 00:46:25,677
and he... He heads off, although he doesn't know what direction.

520
00:46:26,474 --> 00:46:31,654
And by morning, you know, the nephews of woken up and they're they're looking pretty rough. They're

521
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:37,593
wandering off through the bush. And, you know, that this is incredibly dangerous. Right? Like,

522
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:42,502
in in real life, you're pretty much dead if you don't have a good supply of water out here.

523
00:46:43,419 --> 00:46:45,556
And and so we cut back to Donald

524
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:49,402
also in a rough patch. He's walking past some

525
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,278
clumps of grass

526
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:56,565
hearing some what he thinks to be howell h sounds

527
00:46:57,265 --> 00:47:05,220
and seeing some vis spines poking out of them and in his state. He doesn't realize that it's bush man, it's originals

528
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,819
watching him very men.

529
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,395
I like the panel with the bush with the spears

530
00:47:11,973 --> 00:47:15,486
they kinda tried to match the the little things sticking out of the bushes.

531
00:47:15,965 --> 00:47:18,421
Right. Alright. So the Nephews

532
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,990
are approaching a

533
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:28,005
pile a big amount of rocks, and they see a kangaroo ahead that turns out to be more inform weeping again

534
00:47:28,622 --> 00:47:29,481
So they figured

535
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:34,863
that Donald has escaped and, you know, I'll take a moment to feel pretty bad for more

536
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:35,939
losing

537
00:47:36,276 --> 00:47:45,740
another child there. And so they track down on... Their their uncle uncles tracks, which they find, but they see some originals

538
00:47:46,574 --> 00:47:47,473
footprints also

539
00:47:48,052 --> 00:47:51,509
converging and they can see where he has been captured.

540
00:47:52,168 --> 00:47:55,245
And and so they they run off after him.

541
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,280
Be promoting the fact that he's gonna be eaten by cannibal.

542
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,480
And then we cut to Donald

543
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,880
surrounded by the app originals

544
00:48:03,474 --> 00:48:04,934
they're using some pretty

545
00:48:05,434 --> 00:48:06,974
bad pigeon speak

546
00:48:07,474 --> 00:48:08,494
saying that he's...

547
00:48:08,954 --> 00:48:19,296
He looks hungry. He needs to be found up and donald understands that there's only one reason for that. Well, you know, that... So maybe maybe I'm wrong here, but I feel like he

548
00:48:19,714 --> 00:48:20,214
intentionally

549
00:48:20,592 --> 00:48:21,651
avoided directly

550
00:48:22,084 --> 00:48:31,756
stating that they were going to eat him. It's Donald the only one who mentions that they mentioned that he's skinny and that he will make a fine price

551
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:42,413
mh But I I haven't seen any indication that they're actually trying to kill him or eat him that comes directly from them. I and I think maybe he did that

552
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:43,370
intentionally.

553
00:48:43,866 --> 00:48:46,935
To it's it's implied, but not directly stated.

554
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:50,270
Right. You you think maybe there's some ambiguity.

555
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:56,043
I... That's a very generous reading. I like that you're being generous but

556
00:48:56,482 --> 00:48:59,374
You know, there there are gonna be a few more stories

557
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:04,519
coming up that also have some of these, like, savage

558
00:49:05,016 --> 00:49:05,450
du depiction.

559
00:49:06,307 --> 00:49:15,161
This is one of the realities of a lot of great comic creators of this time. Right? Like, I... I'm not trying to call out Carl Barks here.

560
00:49:16,575 --> 00:49:22,355
You know, I've seen, like, twenty thousand leads under the sea from Disney and Swiss Family Robinson

561
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:28,290
they have these kinds of du depiction of savages in the movies. Go and and Oh dare

562
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,810
in the Asterisk

563
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:36,381
comet, ten ten, you know, the ten ten common So like, I'm not trying to pick on barb specifically.

564
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,059
But unfortunately,

565
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:43,990
he's got these really timeless breaks stories that are are marred by

566
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:47,830
by some of these depictions. And like this is

567
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:55,548
something that American society was really interested in at this time. Yeah. See it all over the place. It's just that his stories have held up.

568
00:49:55,965 --> 00:50:06,251
So we we end up having to compare them to media from today where we're should be comparing it to other stuff of its time and just kind of understanding

569
00:50:07,162 --> 00:50:08,261
But but we do

570
00:50:08,718 --> 00:50:11,789
recognize that, you know, these these are not great depictions.

571
00:50:12,707 --> 00:50:13,366
We do

572
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,416
as you know, maybe they mentioned,

573
00:50:15,755 --> 00:50:17,891
you know, a price Al the cara,

574
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:24,652
which is a fun term. I... I'm... I learned that and second grade during our unit on our Australia. It's like a big

575
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,369
original festival.

576
00:50:26,707 --> 00:50:29,282
Oh yeah. I attended one when I was there. Awesome.

577
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,059
How was that?

578
00:50:30,937 --> 00:50:32,010
We didn't have duct

579
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:33,608
I think it was

580
00:50:34,187 --> 00:50:34,687
sandwiches.

581
00:50:35,106 --> 00:50:38,482
Oh, good. Yeah. Yeah. It was good it was really... It was

582
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:39,820
cool to see.

583
00:50:40,513 --> 00:50:42,824
Right on. So Donald, you know,

584
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:47,600
understandably is freaking out and he tries to escape

585
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,220
This is our obligatory Barks

586
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,560
this is our obligatory

587
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:53,760
boomerang

588
00:50:56,033 --> 00:50:59,170
can't not have that. Can't visit Australia

589
00:51:00,149 --> 00:51:02,527
without a character not understanding

590
00:51:02,946 --> 00:51:03,945
how boomerang works.

591
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,060
And

592
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:20,291
you know, I guess they make make some effort. Barks me some effort to to not make it look like it does that magic call forward and back. You can you can see some of the arc that real boomerang has. Right? Oh yeah. It doesn't do the direct one eighty

593
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:24,420
doesn't an Barks to it. So on one quick bit of

594
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,579
boomerang trivia.

595
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:26,240
Yeah.

596
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,114
There are different types of boomerang. That and they actually

597
00:51:30,814 --> 00:51:33,434
use boomerang for hunting birds

598
00:51:33,775 --> 00:51:44,969
and the primary purpose, they they had two types of boom boomerang. That'd be standard side kind that you see and the purpose was to not hit the birds with these ones, but it you would throw it

599
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:46,529
around the birds

600
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:54,705
and it would scare the birds towards you. So then you have a whole flock of birds instead of you trying to hunt them and them flying away from you.

601
00:51:55,637 --> 00:52:03,435
It it gets behind him, makes them all fly towards you. They had another style of boomerang that was shaped kinda like a Nike symbol

602
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:18,554
that they called... I don't know. Yeah person was told me about it them just called them killing Boom boomerang where they were just blunt. They didn't... They didn't have any arc to them. They were just blunt. And you threw them and they just go straight, and they they would kill the birds.

603
00:52:19,213 --> 00:52:20,192
That makes

604
00:52:20,691 --> 00:52:22,129
immensely more sense.

605
00:52:22,824 --> 00:52:28,124
Then like the the the the arc to scare Barks towards you. That makes so much

606
00:52:28,544 --> 00:52:32,051
kinda stupid Scrooge them towards you. Yeah. Yeah. It's really,

607
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:33,185
you know,

608
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:39,599
imagination that Americans, and I I think probably a lot of other people have of boomerang work?

609
00:52:40,136 --> 00:52:40,636
Like

610
00:52:40,974 --> 00:52:41,474
the

611
00:52:41,971 --> 00:52:46,738
that comes Barks to you, obviously, if you strike something with it it's just fall with

612
00:52:47,689 --> 00:52:52,298
and we they used it correctly here to bring a bird closer to.

613
00:52:53,115 --> 00:52:53,974
That's true.

614
00:52:56,004 --> 00:53:03,914
So Donald does have a pretty good pit line after the does bring him down. He says, and I'm the guy that said there was no excitement in this country.

615
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,465
So on the next page, the nephews

616
00:53:06,923 --> 00:53:12,750
have gotten to the point where they can see smoke coming from what they assume must be the bush man's camp.

617
00:53:13,803 --> 00:53:15,739
And they approach donald

618
00:53:16,237 --> 00:53:17,695
where donald been captured.

619
00:53:18,592 --> 00:53:21,726
We cut back to the camp where the aboriginal are

620
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:23,975
offering him some food

621
00:53:24,633 --> 00:53:27,328
He looks at it, and he says it's scorched

622
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:28,424
Al.

623
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:35,999
Al, I think are less or a, yeah. Al an American thing, but whatever. It's a fun guy.

624
00:53:36,656 --> 00:53:39,947
But he's they'd recognize he's American and we're trying to make him himself.

625
00:53:40,459 --> 00:53:40,959
Sure.

626
00:53:41,736 --> 00:53:44,033
And we see it. It's a pretty gross looking

627
00:53:44,411 --> 00:53:44,911
pet

628
00:53:46,008 --> 00:53:56,857
So he doesn't like that. So they offer him what he identifies as wizard. And for whatever reason, Barks doesn't show that that's kept off the panel. Yeah. I'm wondering if

629
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:05,994
is too morbid to think about eating an animal that isn't generally depicted as food. Yeah or he didn't know... Maybe he didn't have a good reference

630
00:54:06,414 --> 00:54:07,994
photo for Australian and Lizard.

631
00:54:08,775 --> 00:54:12,035
So Donald, you know, is, again, he's

632
00:54:13,255 --> 00:54:16,289
upset, and he must up the strength to try and escape.

633
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:21,069
This time, they say they're gonna pin him with a spear. He throws back the boomerang,

634
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:26,224
and by the neck page, you know, it's gonna come sw back and he's gonna accidentally

635
00:54:26,604 --> 00:54:27,564
subdue himself.

636
00:54:28,044 --> 00:54:39,004
Alright. So he's he's good and caught. And we transition to the to that night where the nephews spying at the edge of the camp. One of the nephews is looking at

637
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:42,535
a large bird roast over the fire.

638
00:54:43,093 --> 00:54:46,226
And the first time I read this, I remember being pretty

639
00:54:46,538 --> 00:54:47,278
wondering if.

640
00:54:48,612 --> 00:54:50,229
But the the other nephew you

641
00:54:50,686 --> 00:54:51,723
for him that that's Al.

642
00:54:53,517 --> 00:54:54,735
In case. Sure wondering,

643
00:54:55,512 --> 00:54:59,498
reassuring him and This is one of the few times that were made to think

644
00:55:00,116 --> 00:55:06,299
about donald as like a bird instead of a human. I think it really kinda it is jarring.

645
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:11,739
Yeah. When he's looking at the dead, the screeching gel, and then you've got this roasting e

646
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:13,411
Yeah. Yeah.

647
00:55:14,808 --> 00:55:16,425
Essentially very weird.

648
00:55:17,321 --> 00:55:17,821
So,

649
00:55:18,638 --> 00:55:22,822
you know, as they sneak into the camp. They hear someone breathing

650
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:30,653
maybe a a century hiding in the grass someone one nephew goes to knock him out and barely stops himself before

651
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:31,490
striking

652
00:55:31,868 --> 00:55:32,368
bound

653
00:55:32,865 --> 00:55:33,365
Donald,

654
00:55:33,742 --> 00:55:36,316
and they they release him and,

655
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:39,187
you know, this is another of those

656
00:55:39,819 --> 00:55:50,404
awkward moments where he says dewey thank goodness, those Barks state to me out here, so the police wouldn't find me. I don't think that's meant to be like

657
00:55:50,704 --> 00:55:59,410
as pe as it sounds, but, you know, obviously, it doesn't sound great. This is one of the times that I hear him kind of reference anything like that.

658
00:55:59,868 --> 00:56:01,286
You know, the

659
00:56:02,502 --> 00:56:10,855
most of the that I met they refer to other originals as black fellas. And so I noticed these the work fella here a lot too.

660
00:56:11,548 --> 00:56:14,086
Right. And that that is a common term

661
00:56:14,424 --> 00:56:18,379
and to use the the word black over there well I would never refer to them.

662
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:24,348
Right That way, they... That is a common way that they refer to each other, you know, even now.

663
00:56:24,947 --> 00:56:39,700
I I also noticed too. I didn't even notice when I first read this the move cooking on the spit when actually the way that they cook kangaroo, and those as they build a pit on the fire pit and the ground, and then they buried the car

664
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,334
in the ground on the ashes, and then we'll leave it for about six hours

665
00:56:44,688 --> 00:56:51,133
and then they'll dig it up and then scan it and everything cooked like that. So sounds a lot more efficient. Alright. So

666
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:52,922
the the Inducks

667
00:56:52,922 --> 00:56:57,861
have a pretty rough night in morning because they have to make as much distance between themselves.

668
00:56:59,176 --> 00:56:59,676
And

669
00:57:00,068 --> 00:57:36,245
I'm just gonna read these couple lines. One of the f says we've... We've come miles and miles, can't we stop and rest a while. Donald says, no, we don't dare. Those bush men or the best tractors on birth, and they must be on our trail by now. And, you know, this was a a little more respectful. Right? Because that is something that the aboriginal are are known for it. Yeah. Definitely. And and this this this next page has a just an agonizing sequence that, again, makes me feel so hot and thirsty every time i read it. They kinda pull over to a rock to use up their last

670
00:57:36,742 --> 00:57:40,448
water actions because Donald hasn't had a drinks since yesterday.

671
00:57:40,785 --> 00:57:52,034
They... The Nephew looks in the. There's a single drop left and Donald generously poor on the pocket and cuts it half ways. It's it's very funny.

672
00:57:52,774 --> 00:57:53,514
It's also

673
00:57:54,334 --> 00:57:55,954
very very uncomfortable.

674
00:57:56,429 --> 00:58:00,449
Guy. What was that... What was that cartoon where they slice a bean?

675
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,169
Oh, yeah. A single bean

676
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:05,099
divided equally and

677
00:58:05,755 --> 00:58:10,998
in Mickey beans. That's right. He's... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what i reminder. That's right

678
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:19,824
of that. I was his son really contrast to the moon who... The moon seemed worried. But the sun he's enjoying this Yeah.

679
00:58:20,544 --> 00:58:21,644
It's pouring down.

680
00:58:22,464 --> 00:58:23,164
Yeah. That

681
00:58:23,544 --> 00:58:24,484
bonafide sun

682
00:58:24,784 --> 00:58:25,404
with the

683
00:58:25,784 --> 00:58:38,187
the lot. And they keep walking and, you know, there's some pretty cool art in this panel here where you're behind them looking over their shoulders and you can see some heat waves ripping in the distance.

684
00:58:39,201 --> 00:58:44,596
Yeah. I almost feel like this panel is inspired by Airs rock where you've got just...

685
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:45,814
That's

686
00:58:46,231 --> 00:59:15,748
out right in the middle of Australia, and there's just everything flat for miles and miles. You can't see any mountains or hills And then Arr rock is this giant. What do they call it now though it's been renamed to, like, Lou, I think. I didn't... I wasn't aware they renamed it. It's not called Arr rock anymore. Right. I I think it was the... I think it was named for the tribe. Yeah. Yeah. I could see that. It is kinda of. And again, it's just looking worse and worse for the debts. They've got scavenger your eagles following them.

687
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,965
We see that the aboriginal are

688
00:59:19,399 --> 00:59:31,066
tracking them. The rocks they noticed are the ones seem to be the ones where they saw more full mary, which means they're only one days walk from the station. So maybe they can make it. But, unfortunately,

689
00:59:31,522 --> 00:59:35,985
they turn their shoulder over their shoulder. They see that the bush are only one minute.

690
00:59:36,998 --> 00:59:42,392
So they have to make a break for it on the next page here. And as they pass the rock,

691
00:59:43,391 --> 00:59:47,984
more info Mary is there she observe them. She squeak

692
00:59:48,324 --> 00:59:48,824
excited,

693
00:59:49,364 --> 00:59:51,684
a bunch of cartoon hearts come out of her.

694
00:59:52,644 --> 00:59:57,508
The the Ducktales are bracing themselves for to to be smeared.

695
00:59:57,965 --> 01:00:04,383
But just then of course, more Mary weep in as they throw their spears.

696
01:00:04,962 --> 01:00:09,058
Donald gets in their pouch, the boys climb on their back, and

697
01:00:09,477 --> 01:00:11,714
Donald tells her home Mama.

698
01:00:12,249 --> 01:00:15,426
So he's definitely leaning in here. And and I like that whole

699
01:00:15,884 --> 01:00:20,234
concept when you have. Because this one doesn't really have a, you know, an ant antagonist in

700
01:00:20,614 --> 01:00:29,985
directly. It starts off as more informed air. So I like the... I like the shift when they introduce the second group and then, you know, the original antagonist

701
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:32,137
comes in and saves the day and so yeah.

702
01:00:32,976 --> 01:00:41,164
You're right. There's no real villain in this one. Right? I mean... The originals are more like Al a force of nature They're more like four nature

703
01:00:41,624 --> 01:00:45,784
there. And I I'm still standing by it. I don't think their plan was to eat them at all.

704
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:48,275
Alright. They hadn't... They already had an new.

705
01:00:49,073 --> 01:00:49,592
You know, I mean,

706
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:53,664
I think they were honored guess. He looked hungry. He's trying to feed him.

707
01:00:54,462 --> 01:01:01,019
And now the only reason they're attached because they're... Because they're calling the cops, you know, they don't want them to snitch on them which I wouldn't either, you know?

708
01:01:01,857 --> 01:01:04,010
Sure. You're you're really going bad for them.

709
01:01:05,406 --> 01:01:06,519
Al allow. It.

710
01:01:07,059 --> 01:01:10,559
So on the next page, you know, they're they're making great time

711
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:14,639
by kangaroo. They figure out that they can kinda steer Mary

712
01:01:15,914 --> 01:01:19,454
And they get back at the station where they were trapping,

713
01:01:19,794 --> 01:01:26,390
one big leap over the fence and they unfortunately land right in one of their pitt,

714
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:30,509
and and they're all stuck unless someone finds them.

715
01:01:30,809 --> 01:01:33,002
And when they call help, the

716
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:35,353
the station manager comes

717
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:48,485
and they're able to show him that more full Mary is is with them now. And, you know, you mentioned that it's pretty ridiculous that this oh know, small pit. You know I changed my mind though because he she was fresh.

718
01:01:49,341 --> 01:01:59,405
She was fresh. When she jumped over the plane. She's been carrying donald and three other dogs, and they've already shown how hot it is out there. Yeah. She's probably just tired.

719
01:01:59,779 --> 01:02:11,508
That's true. She also landed, like, in a way, she didn't expect. Right? So she like old all or something. She attacked a bunch of bush, you know, she's had she said kind of Al been promotional day know.

720
01:02:12,346 --> 01:02:14,323
And so the station manager

721
01:02:14,701 --> 01:02:18,887
does what station managers do. Right? He's sees the opportunity.

722
01:02:19,824 --> 01:02:21,641
He prepares to

723
01:02:22,059 --> 01:02:22,919
shoot her

724
01:02:23,337 --> 01:02:26,711
but the du protest, you know, she saved their lives

725
01:02:27,184 --> 01:02:28,762
she needs to go free.

726
01:02:29,661 --> 01:02:36,088
He protests, I can't let her go free. She's racking my crops, and I'm paying you a thousand pounds. And Donald

727
01:02:36,707 --> 01:02:37,606
very virtually

728
01:02:38,065 --> 01:02:44,094
says that he doesn't want the reward, then he'll keep Mary so that she can go free.

729
01:02:44,514 --> 01:02:45,614
The station manager

730
01:02:45,914 --> 01:02:54,469
uses as an American isn't. He says you've made yourself a deal, and we transition to them on a ship randomly named the s asthma.

731
01:02:55,329 --> 01:03:34,639
Failing from Sydney to to the Us say, the decks are feeling great. We transitioned to the fact that Donald is where he always is. He's got a big crowd around him knocking at the duck riding around in more Mary's, I guess not so more in full anymore. Or less more in full. In her pouch. He says, yeah I don't get tired. I don't find her tire some pet. I do get kinda tired of riding around in her pouch several hours a day to keep her happy. And she does indeed look very happy So nice sweet little ending there. Yeah. You know, I think I'm standing by the... He's still a little bit. He he wants.

732
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:38,555
He wants to be in her pouch. She wants to be a kangaroo.

733
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:40,329
It's un

734
01:03:40,869 --> 01:03:43,609
of from what I've seen from Donald to just turn down

735
01:03:43,909 --> 01:03:45,369
that large amount of money

736
01:03:45,949 --> 01:03:51,775
to saver her Al Yeah. I think it's still, you know... So it's his cover story you think. Dwindling

737
01:03:52,512 --> 01:03:53,012
affects

738
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,665
of the Hi h diagnosis. Yeah. Well,

739
01:03:56,479 --> 01:04:00,376
You know, it's it's a very sweet ending to a pretty weird story.

740
01:04:01,394 --> 01:04:03,852
We can talk in in a moment about...

741
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:15,128
Yeah. And you know what? Let's go right into tell me tell me Ben, what... How did you feel about this story? I know that you're new to this, but I know that you did read a couple of other stories kind of in preparation. Yeah.

742
01:04:16,126 --> 01:04:19,660
Yeah. I... You know, I I like just seeing the...

743
01:04:20,118 --> 01:04:22,614
Like, you mentioned that just the art artistic

744
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:36,683
depiction of Australia. It's kind of interesting to see, you know, we think of our current tropes and everything that we think of about Australia and stereo, but kinda... So it's kind of fun to see a little snapshot

745
01:04:37,221 --> 01:04:45,374
before we had some of the stereotypes we have now. I mean, there's still kangaroo. They're still boomerang and there things that we just don't have here.

746
01:04:46,371 --> 01:04:54,143
So, yeah, I thought at it was a little bit different. The characters are different than the way I remember them. I just seemed like Huey, dewey and Louis were

747
01:04:54,877 --> 01:04:59,002
kinda pointless. They... Only the real purpose they served was

748
01:04:59,712 --> 01:05:09,793
when he was tied up, and they finally they they did un him. But, you know, like, it seems like Donald did all the work here. He was the one coming up with the traps. He was the one that dressed Al the kangaroo

749
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:35,633
I don't know. Maybe I'm remembering it wrong, but I always felt like it was like, donald on getting into trouble, and they were always the ones solving things and they're in the in the tear on the swamp one. I mean, they did, you know, they did a whole bunch of problems solving. Whereas this one, they just kinda... Were walking. The whole time. They really Think you're right. Right? They're they're usually a lot more resourceful than this. It's kind of more call that's kind of in that secondary.

750
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:36,473
Yeah

751
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:37,011
Yeah.

752
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:41,627
And so so maybe they just kinda had to step aside for them to

753
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:54,073
allow this more well Mary to have her story. And know. And Yeah, No. It was... I I enjoyed it. It didn't go where I was expecting it to. You kinda have to ignore some of the bush stuff, obviously.

754
01:05:55,328 --> 01:05:55,727
But Yeah.

755
01:05:56,765 --> 01:05:59,818
You know, for the time, I guess it could been worse.

756
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:02,626
There wasn't any kind of...

757
01:06:02,963 --> 01:06:08,310
There always seems to be some type... I guess the hip this part of it. Like I don't know. Some like a concept.

758
01:06:08,644 --> 01:06:12,237
High yeah high concept, you know, they're just kinda out in the bush.

759
01:06:12,955 --> 01:06:19,178
So I guess they have the to aspect of it kinda filled out but it's a little bit be just kind of like Australia.

760
01:06:19,634 --> 01:06:42,932
Right? Was was sort of a high concept in this one. Yeah. I guess maybe that's it because I'm so familiar with Australia. It's it's not as high concepts. So maybe that was enough for the time to to for for them. But so yeah, There's a little different... The characters acted a little bit different. Than the way I remember him. But... Yeah, it was kinda fun. I like it. Yeah. You know what? I I really liked this one as a kid. I remember...

761
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:55,664
It was one of the earlier comments that I had gotten and so I read it a lot, and I definitely still enjoy it, but I don't enjoy it as much as I did. And that's not just because of the stereotypes,

762
01:06:56,002 --> 01:07:00,052
although that's certainly is is a part of it. It's it's a very unusual

763
01:07:00,685 --> 01:07:03,865
story, right? This, like, kind of motherhood

764
01:07:04,525 --> 01:07:04,765
story.

765
01:07:05,365 --> 01:07:05,725
Almost.

766
01:07:06,525 --> 01:07:09,225
It's got some some kinda of weird structure

767
01:07:09,699 --> 01:07:28,097
I really like certain individual parts of that. I love the hip sequence. I love how he kinda launches the story. I feel like the pacing is a little bit unusual. Yeah. I think he does a really effective job of making the outback feel frightening and dangerous.

768
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:35,405
So, you know, we we talk about the Inducks rating, right? Which is the community website that

769
01:07:35,944 --> 01:07:46,048
people have submitted user reviews for many years. So it gives us a really good aggregate for what the community thinks for this one. And this one I mentioned

770
01:07:46,665 --> 01:07:58,032
the, this is an incredibly highly rated story. This one has an eight point five out of ten. And if you think about, you know, hundreds people rating it, That means like, almost universally.

771
01:07:58,411 --> 01:08:12,064
They're giving this very high ratings, very few little ratings to pull it down. This is the ninth best rated not just out of the, like, five hundred plus Barks stories, but all of the Disney comics that might.

772
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,739
Yeah. So

773
01:08:14,395 --> 01:08:26,490
I I I respect it. I think this is a really cool story. You know, it's got some neat like, sadness. I think the the creation of more is really cool. Her, like, relationship

774
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:42,630
with Donald is neat Mh. I I don't quite get why this one is as highly rated though. As it is. Because I do think it's a very fun different unique adventure story, but it didn't stick with me the way that some of them.

775
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:54,126
I think Australia itself has a mass appeal no matter what country you're in. It's a it's a unique place. And so they might and and they might be tacking on their own internal

776
01:08:54,840 --> 01:09:00,300
fascination with Australia to why they like this story. And i see how I would have my.

777
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,800
Yeah. Yes. Exactly. Some of those titles from around the world.

778
01:09:04,414 --> 01:09:16,283
But again, this is maybe one of those cases where, like, hundreds of vaccines can't be wrong, and maybe I'm... Maybe I'm missing something. I I do like a lot of this story. Right? I just...

779
01:09:16,622 --> 01:09:18,599
I just wouldn't put it

780
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:30,388
anywhere near the top. Yeah. So five red three, and I wouldn't put it in the top of the three that I've read so far. Right. But it is enjoyable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't I don't wanna

781
01:09:30,845 --> 01:09:48,165
harp on it. Because again, as a kid I did really really love this when I do still really think. But I just stack it next to, like, we just read ghost to the g. And in the same issue to me that one is is quite a bit of superior. But different rooms. Let's see.

782
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:56,534
Other reflections, you know, we've already kinda talked about some of the data Barks archaic things. I don't feel like we need to go to into it. We know what's

783
01:09:56,994 --> 01:10:03,275
retro grade and and what's problematic. I did find it interesting to see Australia before the opera house though.

784
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:14,762
That that's fun. Yeah. As far as I'm aware, we talk about if there's been any appearances and other media. I I'm not aware of him using any any of these characters again or

785
01:10:15,473 --> 01:10:21,201
or any other economics creators using them He didn't make any of his oil paintings

786
01:10:21,619 --> 01:10:23,814
about this story. From my knowledge.

787
01:10:24,509 --> 01:10:27,409
I did think I had some pretty good educational value

788
01:10:27,869 --> 01:10:29,889
just because it did have some

789
01:10:30,349 --> 01:10:30,849
interesting

790
01:10:31,429 --> 01:10:32,409
Australian terms

791
01:10:32,804 --> 01:10:46,995
and I feel like the outback was pretty well depicted. Oh, yeah. The some Australian things they don't quite get the scale of it Right? And the just even little things like the fact that they took a plane from Sydney to the to the station.

792
01:10:47,834 --> 01:11:02,804
You know, like, yeah, you would do that there's not very many things that are within driving distance semester australia, i I feel like he does a good job of capturing the scale of it. Awesome. Oh, I don't wanna leave out our favorite panel segment.

793
01:11:03,883 --> 01:11:09,392
Ben, did you have any panels that came to mind as as a contender for your favorite.

794
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:17,357
You know, there's a few, you know, artistic. I like the the character design of the hit the hit

795
01:11:17,734 --> 01:11:20,468
yeah. They the clerk at the travel agency

796
01:11:20,925 --> 01:11:26,742
and the... I didn't care much for the the Australian, you know, sheep station owner.

797
01:11:27,477 --> 01:11:29,292
See Al the characters really good.

798
01:11:30,465 --> 01:11:38,210
You know, I I went through and I was looking and I like the design of the cooked bird. I really wish I could've seen the lizard.

799
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:47,410
There aren't really any the other ones I've read definitely have some favorites, but I I kinda lump... I love this the rock formations

800
01:11:47,908 --> 01:11:51,533
art style just So I kinda lump a lot of the...

801
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:54,045
Just to outback, the artwork

802
01:11:54,462 --> 01:12:00,882
There's one I'm looking at now with the rock formation with a creepy little tree with a filter

803
01:12:01,301 --> 01:12:06,329
perched on the top. Oh, yeah. That is a good one. I I just like how every frame

804
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:30,089
without outback. Just kinda has interesting looking bushes and hills and it's not flat. It just everything it looks like it just has a lot of depth to it and layers to it. I think that I feel like they took a couple short shortcuts because there's a lot of panels where there's just too silhouette work. Are all the comics just this detail from one panel to another because there's quite a bit of detail. Yeah. I mean that Spark does is is known for

805
01:12:30,547 --> 01:12:34,614
detail, especially in these early economics. There will be some later ones where he

806
01:12:35,593 --> 01:12:44,499
cuts back a little bit. He's also known for doing those silhouette and sometimes it might be a little bit of shortcut. But sometimes I think it's done for that effect. I'm noticing

807
01:12:45,437 --> 01:12:55,461
whereas I didn't when I was reading these more casually like going through these chronological, I'm taking note of all that silhouette stuff he does. And i with you. There's some pretty awesome

808
01:12:55,841 --> 01:12:57,638
scenes from the outback in this.

809
01:12:58,557 --> 01:13:01,469
There aren't as many like really show panels in this

810
01:13:02,249 --> 01:13:05,489
Right? There's not a not a time like some of the other issues.

811
01:13:05,849 --> 01:13:19,054
If I had to pick one, you know, hold a spirit in my head and pick one, I would probably pick the one The one with the the email... Not the roasting. The one above that one where they're just purged over.

812
01:13:19,709 --> 01:13:22,529
Looking at the camp below. Oh, yeah. The nephews.

813
01:13:22,989 --> 01:13:30,101
The just because there's some cool lighting there. Yeah. You're you're absolutely right. There's some gray lighting and So something

814
01:13:30,559 --> 01:13:38,335
just pick one of those two frames with the... There's two frames there with the dynamic lighting that just looks pretty cool. I agree. Those are really nice.

815
01:13:38,908 --> 01:13:47,541
I think in the absence of a really shall panel, which, you know, I'm usually a set for. I really like the panel that shows him

816
01:13:48,693 --> 01:13:49,552
and crying

817
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:51,610
about it.

818
01:13:52,489 --> 01:13:54,327
I I think that one's pretty awesome.

819
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:59,237
The one of the scavenger eagles also pretty cool yeah. Awesome.

820
01:14:00,215 --> 01:14:04,849
Alright. Well, Ben, thank you so much. I hope to have you back for more of these.
