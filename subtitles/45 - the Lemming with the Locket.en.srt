Yeah. Sure. This is channel. Let me just first talk about that read the competition for norwegian weekly rico on that com. So I guess, yeah. Michael has a couple of

26
00:02:32,349 --> 00:03:10,301

And the because of the what this need Europe or something nor they ask both me goal to do this, like sound little through you session about us being young down that fans and comic with fans. And of course, we're working with it. Being happy to do this as as a covid.

Also have this one little fun experience after actual air yeah the Tv commercials because one day I was taking the bus, there was a little girl coming on and I'm she just saw man and she walked up to me and almost points her finger up in my face and I saw you on Tv, and then know she run the away.

28
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:36,408
What

29
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:44,800
little kids are so funny. Oh, they're little the little minute of fame right there. Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome. That's so great you guys, but that's really cool.

30
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:48,505
And I should mention that Ruben, you have recently

31
00:03:48,922 --> 00:03:53,968
supplied us with some great cover art for the episodes of the ten page

32
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:57,019
podcast. That that we put out, which

33
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:15,459
turned out great. So thank you. You guys can can check him out well, we'll mention that. We'll mention at the end where they can find you if anyone wants to do a commission or anything. So you guys you are both... You... You're both in Norway. Right? You guys are are perfect for this episode

34
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,419
because I figure you can give us a local

35
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:27,638
perspective And and this story is great. It's it's kind of a travel log in a way. Right? Sometimes Barks really Huey,

36
00:04:27,638 --> 00:04:29,155
really take some effort.

37
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:36,129
To localize stories going into the national geographic that you loved so much, learning about the place.

38
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:50,859
I've gotta imagine it's kind of like a good news bad news situation. Right? Because I don't know. There's probably some pretty big stereotypes in this. What what do you guys think? Where did you enjoy Severino Norway featured in this story?

39
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:51,817
Ruben?

40
00:04:52,415 --> 00:05:14,884
Well, I actually didn't create. I'm you about for a long time, but it hasn't actually been printed that much no way. So I actually didn't get to read it. I guess until I randomly found like this best stories from Dom coming and edit. And that was, I guess, it was after I actually saw the Ducktales that itself. I saw Ducktales episode three release of error reading the Barks story. In Ducktales

41
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:17,661
episode and norwegian and translation. They also

42
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,849
call it Norway. We're going to Norway and I find found it. Was this little play? Pull in the duct savers and also in the comic book Barks medicine bit more weight. But for me, that's pretty much where it ends.

43
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:32,044
And it's it's Al. It's an okay

44
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:41,138
presentation of no weight that bad. I guess we will go back to it. Yeah. How about you, Miguel to stand out? Kia. I think it's stand stood

45
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:48,350
or it was not the best story I ever read at the time, but I actually found it first in in an American printing.

46
00:05:48,924 --> 00:06:02,897
Before I phoned them in the region. So my first residence in the call greatest Ducktales stories from Jen that in Published in two thousand and six So I read it the first time along me back to the clone, for example, stood outs

47
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:23,102
a little more to me but sure. But, yeah, I'm I'm quite proud Barks and docs on a question by why while this hill was in his golden age that is concerning the character the design of the Barks. And it was still a few years away from those way two twelve we got around nineteen fifty seven, And this is a little, but

48
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:24,794
the reason for

49
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:29,230
throwing style changed around than the end of the fifties well because

50
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:35,278
west provided him bit more with less quality paper because it cheaper. And

51
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,173
Bur phone is hard to get the Barks

52
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:55,407
and their heights bright in his first try. So it would he would usually shorten them a little before he ink. The new paper made that impossible since the pencil dug to deep into the paper and thereby making it hard to fix So we you would just try best to get the docs right for two years

53
00:06:55,866 --> 00:07:16,099
before he just gave her in nineteen fifty seven with story and stories like T any gan. But after forgot and provided in the better paper. That's interesting. That's a it's fascinating little and tidbit bit that that's something like the paper quality can make such a big difference. You know, since you guys are our artist yourself and do fan are, you probably

54
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:31,671
relate to that more than I would. I can so that's very much with the poor paper policy. Nice. Alright. So you guys... This is I I think you mentioned right, that this is maybe not the best of Barks stories, but is an awfully

55
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,602
fun. Little adventure.

56
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:45,501
And and I I do think that it's like as un remarkable story as it is, it's very memorable. Right? Because we've got this really cool yeah. Hook to talk about this neat

57
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:50,606
journey that the debts are gonna go on. So let's get into a little bit of the background

58
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:58,534
of the story. It's itself. We are talking about the le with the lock. It came out in uncle Scrooge number nine

59
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:04,109
back in in January of nineteen fifty five. And

60
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:13,684
has been reprinted kind of an average number of times. Ten in the United States, including the original printing, This is a... This is a shorter

61
00:08:14,304 --> 00:08:19,379
adventure story. At least for this era. It's only twenty two pages.

62
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,819
We're just a few issues

63
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:35,094
from from his very last thirty two pager. So that these are kind of a different style of stories to me a little bit brisk. And you guys something that I've been thinking about as I've done

64
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:38,090
episodes, I've recorded a bunch of episodes recently

65
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:49,389
for this run of the first handful full of uncle screwed stories. Right? So I can't help but take a little bit of time to think about what the early part of uncle Scrooge

66
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:52,589
run looks like the comic of run,

67
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:56,329
specifically, like issues number one through

68
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:58,384
tan. And it's really

69
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:08,907
interesting to me how we've got these handful of the very early stories, really deal with kind of setting Scrooge up as a character

70
00:09:09,763 --> 00:09:25,556
establishing his origin and what motivates him a little bit and and exploring some really interesting really adult themes. Right? Like Inducks to the lawn can only a poor man and the horse rather story. And then at some point into this first

71
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:27,812
ten stories Barks,

72
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:33,640
I think he's figured... Okay. Why I've got this character. I've successfully soften his edges.

73
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:37,555
Now I'm gonna take him on some. Just plain Al adventures.

74
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:44,666
But but the other thing that I think Barks is doing around this time. Is he's thinking about his character.

75
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:54,645
What is his hook it's that he has an enormous amount of money. So he's essentially cycling through what are the different things that Scrooge

76
00:09:55,179 --> 00:10:03,910
can do with his money. Right? And in the horse rad story, he's trying to hold on to it in Manny mystery,

77
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:07,234
he is trying to keep it safe. He's

78
00:10:07,611 --> 00:10:12,229
relocating it. We're gonna see him do that in a number of different stories going forward

79
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:17,237
in Secret of Atlanta number five. He's trying to recover it.

80
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:21,744
T lies another of those kind of more

81
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:23,384
mature

82
00:10:23,684 --> 00:10:27,084
exploration that to me goes better with the first handful of stories.

83
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:30,438
And then in like the seven cities of S.

84
00:10:31,337 --> 00:10:36,632
He's trying to think about new ways, new interesting ways to make money.

85
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:47,949
And then... And then the mysterious stone rate is just kind of a a pros adventure, I think. But in this one, it is one of those stories where he's trying to just

86
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:55,702
protect his mind. Right? So so Barks has this great hook. It's a character with a huge

87
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:56,541
physical

88
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:09,927
fortune. And and now he's gonna develop. All of these different story templates. And and to my eye, first ten or so screwed stories. You're just him trial all these different types of stories

89
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:15,684
that later he's gonna kinda go back to the well. You know, eventually, we're gonna get kind of comp petitions

90
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:27,287
over his money, but but he really sets out, I think, some interesting templates for the rest of his run. What do you guys think? I think it's results. Also interesting Barks have used

91
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:33,934
Scrooge bin being sick for three times already. First back to the plan, memory loss and

92
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:41,529
is sick of money and stress. And then the mysterious stone right is the skin is full of gold Yeah. Harry,

93
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:53,504
there is really center about this a billion of something. Like it is already used in Al or trial Barks wants to visualize this billion of something to show people

94
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:54,464
astronomical

95
00:11:55,004 --> 00:12:03,619
amounts this really are. Yeah, You're right. I talked about that at length and in the trial. Really was something that he was very interested in

96
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:29,130
just the idea of visualizing that. And thoughts ruben? Well, I think you're completely the right about how Barks are previous from this, but developing the characters, soft Scrooge sanchez. And I definitely feel that from now on, we have the character. Let's find different ways to use it. Right. It's it's almost like he's winding him up and and just seeing what will happen. Right? Because it's such a good hook he's got. Not only the character

97
00:12:29,468 --> 00:12:44,363
himself, but the Money Bin, which we'll talk about here momentarily. Let's see. The the only thing that I did wanna talk about background wise before we get into the story itself is this story is gonna deal with this very

98
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:45,522
pervasive

99
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,560
long lasting

100
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:49,997
myth. Right? This this

101
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:53,849
misconception that people have about le.

102
00:12:54,189 --> 00:13:09,447
Does this drive you guys a little bit crazy as as Norwegian? Does this come up with with people who, you know, the I feel like it's one of the four or five things that Americans think about when they think about Norway. Right? He got like, we're we're scanned

103
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:13,451
and Jen People think about, like, the swedish chef from the up.

104
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:14,927
They think about the

105
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:26,709
they think about Denmark Lego land and and like, and and Ikea, I guess, and that's and Le, and those are the, like, four or so things that Americans know about Canned.

106
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:31,605
How about it ruben? I don't no. But you Ill, but I don't think you're about letting that much.

107
00:13:32,481 --> 00:13:35,270
Ain't neither. It's not something we usually talk about here.

108
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:38,336
Not in my everyday talk and

109
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:43,838
norwegian. I really love talking about what what we call typical marie,

110
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:48,515
like what is like the most norwegian things? It's the knobs

111
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:50,308
our national clothing.

112
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,448
It's the moves and it's the... Well, I was almost gonna say polar bear, that's also Made an infection.

113
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:00,885
Eagles trolls,

114
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:05,109
the brown cheese that I wanna come back to. Did you say chills?

115
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:14,826
Yeah. Definitely nice. That that's cool. Yeah. Trolls are actually on the thing or I wanna say. But my point where that I don't put

116
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:19,269
in that list I never think about lending Al something typical region

117
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:22,138
along with the fields and the moves and

118
00:14:22,474 --> 00:14:32,579
and the high and stuff like that. So it's actually pretty interesting to see the story and compare what should say, mark about Yeah. Planning being one of things that Americans first think of when the

119
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:38,208
because because it definitely is. Part of it is that there's such a good metaphor,

120
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:50,889
right? Or or at least this mistaken idea Right? And that any idea to be clear is is there's the idea that le are this animal that every few years vary seriously

121
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:51,848
will

122
00:14:52,427 --> 00:14:59,080
end mass, like in in in enormous crowds, they'll migrate towards the ocean, and they'll just keep going

123
00:14:59,914 --> 00:15:08,983
They they they'll swim across rivers and lakes and they treat the c as as a late or something, and they'll just jump off into it and and drown,

124
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:15,260
you know, and and massive amounts of of le will will die on these mysterious journeys.

125
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,293
Do you?

126
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,434
Well, it is it is true lot le from time to time doing this huge

127
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:25,595
migrations, but that's just because they for some reason, getting

128
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:31,953
way to many of them and then they also to move to find fruits and unable to cross river and on and

129
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:41,137
travel over the moment. That that's not the collective I mentioned. Right. And I think that's the misconception Right? Is that they're deliberately jumping

130
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:48,222
to mindless leslie, jump into their debts? Yeah. And I just have to do little research because I said I don't actually know

131
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:50,777
and don't know that much

132
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:51,935
and I found

133
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:56,126
live the mountains and whether like swimming

134
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,456
we call when huge amounts of limits. They'll eat up

135
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:02,891
there's no more mouse or plans

136
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:22,961
or bear is there and then they'll come down for the mountains and they could come as close as still short but they won't actually survive their So just because there are the type of that that they would eat, I guess and around type of climate that... Or maybe tours welcome come. Right. I don't the gym out the ocean.

137
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:38,512
I at least I can find any information about it. All of them. Well, what we're gonna talk about later? I don't think so jump into the ocean, but I think they accidentally drone and they tried to cross the rivers reverse and so on. So then it... Maybe people talk them wrong out. When there right. So there's this, like,

138
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:52,312
misconception. Right? Because anytime that that many millions of something are gonna move in Unison. Some of them are gonna tram folder whatever. But I I guess very famously walt Disney had put out a documentary

139
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:54,441
called white Wilderness

140
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,356
back in the late fifties,

141
00:16:56,894 --> 00:17:10,082
which in in which it was found later that this crew, this documentary crew is actually hurting them and throwing them off some clips in this very terrible and sensational way

142
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:15,036
to match the myth that everyone apparently believed about

143
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:15,695
swimming.

144
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:19,440
So the... Apparently, this did not create,

145
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:23,188
you know, the the belief, but it really popularized

146
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,142
it. Because, obviously, time

147
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:26,832
the in the timeline,

148
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,624
Barb already has this concept.

149
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:38,097
And and he doesn't really talk about them being like, suicidal or anything like that. But he does talk about it being this, like, mysterious

150
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:46,065
purge that people don't really understand. So I guess we can talk about it more when we get to that huge c of le

151
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:55,017
moving about. Very quickly you guys we we're gonna pan to some of our listeners from around the world. I've got a couple of titles

152
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:55,973
to

153
00:17:56,644 --> 00:17:59,504
to share. And what's more appropriate?

154
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:02,024
Right? Then for our Norwegian,

155
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:05,644
set story with a couple of Norwegian guest host,

156
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:10,108
But for me, the American to do the Norwegian title. So

157
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:13,258
here, I'm gonna go ahead and butcher it in Norway,

158
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:20,632
you all call it le yacht in, which is the le hunt. Hopefully, I didn't embarrass myself too badly there.

159
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,326
And then, Mi miguel, you want to

160
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:30,425
hit us with the Italian title? Yeah. I will I will say So serena in advance if really really but

161
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:34,372
the italian title is ill

162
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,198
the with.

163
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:47,591
Yeah pretty good Al far as I know. And how about you, Ruben, you've got Stain? Yeah. I love this very like poetic title. It's ten at

164
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:55,506
pair and means that thief melts or the correct, I believe. Yeah. I I enjoy that too. The Spanish Publishers

165
00:18:55,819 --> 00:19:12,305
seem to to my eye, they seem to do a better job than many of the countries of finding these kind of poetic fun translations. Alright, you guys. So we've we've talked about kinda of what we're gonna be thinking about and, you know, as we go through the story, we're we're kinda thinking about what is Barks

166
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:14,736
idea of Norway,

167
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:21,481
What is this kind of impression that people have of le and how is this early Scrooge adventure

168
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:27,583
gonna shape up. Are you guys ready to go through the story itself? Okay awesome sign in to the money.

169
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:29,160
Alright. So

170
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:48,934
as is the case with so many of these screwed stories. You know, Ruben, we were kinda having exchange about this on Facebook. They they so frequently start out with Scrooge in his money Bin, Either enjoying his fortune or worrying about it. And, you know, I... When I had

171
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:58,089
Y came from Dan Denmark, who's an editor with Ag on a few months ago. He talked about how Barb did such a good job of, like,

172
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:03,496
reestablish the character each time. Right? Because this is still a pretty new series

173
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,890
So he would have expected thousands of new readers each month.

174
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,470
And we get a lot of information

175
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,350
about Scrooge immediately

176
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,630
with this opening

177
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,756
where He is focused on his immense vault door.

178
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:22,835
His office is adorned with money symbols and actual money just laying around.

179
00:20:23,688 --> 00:20:26,699
And and we see that he is very satisfied

180
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:31,855
with a new safe that he's got. And we we kind of flash back

181
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:34,972
outside to see his been with a new

182
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:36,970
configuration. It is

183
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:40,885
this big block of what he calls in imp.

184
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,076
Al an ind.

185
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:47,679
Metal. That's ten foot thick, and he's now got seven locks

186
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:50,111
meaning that his remaining two

187
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:55,592
So remaining is because Scrooge is p reported to spend

188
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:57,645
half of his fortune.

189
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:03,075
On this new bin. Right? And and his remaining two hundred and fifty

190
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,552
fab italian dollars

191
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:07,510
is safe because

192
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:08,324
only

193
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:12,179
he knows the combination for those seven locks.

194
00:21:12,658 --> 00:21:13,877
So so there's

195
00:21:14,216 --> 00:21:18,203
right away on this first page you guys, there's a lot to

196
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:32,605
unpack here. Did it ever bother you guys when when you would see Scrooge do something like this like spend half of his fortune to protect the other half. I'm kinda happy. It's just extra sketch in the next story because this is kinda crazy.

197
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:45,618
To see half portion. And then just right after that it will be... It will be scared that is rodent into rat will be now is way into this box Like you even me really bought himself some poor

198
00:21:45,997 --> 00:21:54,569
feeling of safe dealer. Right. Yeah. And and and I'll note too that in these first few uncle Scrooge issues. He identifies the fortune

199
00:21:55,105 --> 00:22:12,567
multiple times and this is yet another new dollar figure that we've got for it. And and we've got this new configuration of the Bin. What do you think about that, Ruben? Yeah. I I couldn't stop thinking about because in the region translations, instead of saying it's his new safe he says it his new one that.

200
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:16,415
And I see new money. So I think

201
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:25,980
when was the last time we saw the exterior of the money? And then I just kept digging going further down into rabbit and I actually started...

202
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:29,928
Let we just say, I'm about to talk about the

203
00:22:30,504 --> 00:22:43,566
evolution of the monitor actually. Because let me just start... This is the last time we see like a configuration of the mono that isn't the iconic one we know. This is like, the last time we see Barks experimenting with the exterior

204
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:53,095
visual of the one of it. Right. So the first time we saw edit type of one event, I believe, that isn't just a mac Ducktales building entrance is actually in a financial

205
00:22:53,515 --> 00:23:00,984
when he has this corn grip. And the next time we see him is in the terra of the b voice, say nineteen fifty one. We see this skyscraper

206
00:23:01,362 --> 00:23:37,376
with a dollar sign on top. Right. And then becomes a big on K Hill. Well, we mostly see, like it's a on killer hill. And it's a square box, and it with all these wrapped pretty much the one know. The only thing that doesn't really fit is that it doesn't have that giant dollar sign from. Instead of having a safe lock, and oversized face safe look. Bin itself just Barks like an oversized site We just with an idea. And then for Christmas for Check count one year later, we see the mona bam visually or one of the drawings that the scientist hold up to them. So it's only drawing. And then we come to only Al man.

207
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:52,832
Number one, I believe. Right? Pretty close. That's pretty close. It is we have the big dollar sign on the front, but it's not completely specific. It's more of. Also there are a couple more windows staple details like that. And of course, it be in the city center with.

208
00:23:53,449 --> 00:24:08,710
No k motor hill there. That's which was necessary for the story. Exactly. My the the inside of the money be in the money vault and the Barks have kind to find it already in on the portal man and back to the front So it's just exterior I'm gonna keep changing. I guess

209
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:31,634
about stereo. That's true. Antonio is shown multiple times. But we... It's very rarely in this space of time. That we actually see the exterior of. Mostly just like this small entrance of the Mac building. So the next time again, is the round one event which is a new one completely, and also that that is different because it's around and then we come to this story with this interpretation with the Ban

210
00:24:32,464 --> 00:24:41,637
Well, mark, would you want to, like, describe product it looks like? Yeah. Sure. In this one, it has definitely its kind of Barks

211
00:24:41,956 --> 00:24:47,184
structure you know, it's a top its perch on the hill. But it has almost this like, vest

212
00:24:47,922 --> 00:25:04,110
front, right? Like an an x str front building or a front front entrance that seems to be devoted entirely to, like, the office space. And honestly, it's it's a pretty cool look for the Bin. You know, I I could see if he... If he had kept this,

213
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:15,428
and just added that iconic dollar sign. I could see that becoming like the icon look, but there's really no replacing the release Barks

214
00:25:15,428 --> 00:25:23,832
spare, I think, look of the the quote real bin. What what do you think Rubin? Yeah. Exactly. I think it's great. But and kinda

215
00:25:24,464 --> 00:26:00,143
Al like but that like office building in the front that was Al already and there, and then he failed built like this big vault on the back of it. Like a new building connected to it. That's kind of the way I to pay it. It looks great. But I'm very glad that we ended up with the bit with it because it's it's a cube and it's great to be playing right playing around with. In that way. And that one them as we know it will come in the mix four it's in... Yeah. It's in the next four issues after this one of the Scrooge. It won't be shown in land beneath the ground in nineteen fifty six I thirteen.

216
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,055
That that was like you were coming through my lecture of

217
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:04,469
evolution.

218
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:10,900
Now there will be a snack Going room. Real sandwiches and left tomorrow glass beef.

219
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,300
I'm.

220
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,680
That is a great ted talk there.

221
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:35,056
Now thank thank you. That was a cool tour. You know, I I talked a lot about that in my episode on the big Bin. Kim motor Hill, which I paired with the round money bin, but it didn't go into it. Nearly Al systematically. So that was awesome. Thank you. So let's go ahead and delve back into the the progression here.

222
00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:39,260
Interesting that in the very beginning of the story. It's mostly Scrooge

223
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:51,249
internal monologue. He continues to think about how satisfied he is about how safe his new building is and that it only he has the code

224
00:26:51,628 --> 00:26:58,175
the combination to the seven locks. Which, he places... He's written down on a slip of paper,

225
00:26:58,554 --> 00:26:59,493
any he places

226
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:01,590
inside a tiny lock.

227
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:04,636
And then he subsequently hangs the little locket.

228
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:11,370
Around a small statue of himself and then he just kinda sits back and bath

229
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:25,910
and and how safe he thinks his money is. What you guys think you you probably were old enough when you read this to to kind of know how this was gonna go. Right? Miguel? Yeah. This is immediately set for catastrophe, because Scrooge not.

230
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:31,857
It thinks is in control of the situation. And this whole story is basically about the illusion

231
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:36,421
about being in control. And then screws data plunge into chaos.

232
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:41,691
I would like to just bind wind back a little before we move on with the story because

233
00:27:42,189 --> 00:27:45,940
the splash panel has screw and Scrooge closing the vendor.

234
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,340
Well, we Al already talked about

235
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,820
our Barks has

236
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,660
established

237
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:05,218
because we will as a character and the previous stories. Having has only been showing as well And here we have screws closing the door to them to both. Kind of closing the door on all these previous establishing stories from

238
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:07,790
no on, we move forward the new adventures.

239
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:09,942
It's kind of a poetic

240
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:13,974
special panel right there. Yeah. He's not in inside the Bin.

241
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:19,138
Like, the the vault itself and this one unlike most of Yeah. It's a good point.

242
00:28:19,636 --> 00:28:28,375
The one thing I can start thinking about both when I was here again, this time, Scrooge is hanging at elm around the statute, and what that's that too. It's a great question.

243
00:28:30,035 --> 00:28:41,310
I know I had the same thought as like, a Barks. That... It's such a goofy thing. Right? Because his expression is very un Scrooge like And what weird, like, he's not usually

244
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:48,274
one to be self centered like that. It's it's interesting. I'm I'm sure we'll we'll mention the duck

245
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:57,703
episode at the end, but it's interesting that they chose to make that a statue of glittering bold when they adapt it rather than having Scrooge kind of like looking

246
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:59,179
self obsessed.

247
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:07,345
So we're gonna transition Al this point. To screws Nephews, Donald Huey, doing wayne Louie are in enjoying

248
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,719
some fishing over by the docks. And

249
00:29:11,297 --> 00:29:29,264
they're they're in the process of taking of a food break. And we get this set up that the Nephews apparently are a big fan of some specific cheese that was imported all the way from Norway. And really quickly you guys I do not associate as an American.

250
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:32,153
Don't associate Norway with its cheese.

251
00:29:34,027 --> 00:29:35,803
I much heard Barks back?

252
00:29:36,913 --> 00:29:58,816
Okay I I know that every country has, like, it's cheese that it's famous for in Europe. And, like, if you impressed me I could probably have come up with I wouldn't have peg it specifically to Nor out. I mean like, oh, it's the scan one. Right? Because of the name, most Americans are gonna think of France when they think of cheese.

253
00:29:59,494 --> 00:30:06,712
So that that that always struck me a little bit weird. Norwegian cheese. Those don't seem to go together to me. Yeah. I actually

254
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:20,736
started with this research about that because I talked about what we see here ourselves as typical reach. No. We don't actually see our help as a cheese nation. I see what you see about putting, like, the whole new Europe and like, everyone has its cheese permissions.

255
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,850
But

256
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,390
probably six or seven.

257
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,450
European countries that I would have named that I would have associated

258
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,390
first.

259
00:30:30,323 --> 00:30:47,599
Exactly. So I like I had to Google black reach and cheese when it's going up. And then of course, there's an article that says like, oh, what we I actually have ever rich? Please cheese tradition. It's just not that loan out of get. But I did wanna mention the brown cheese that we do see

260
00:30:48,851 --> 00:31:20,865
and it is it's goat cheese. And it's more like caramel ish. And sweet. And also, we have, like, the y'all that Michael mentioned that is like if it's famous for being like this cheese wheel, and I believe you can buy in some stores in the united states. It's not that it doesn't work. It just... I don't make the connection. Immediately. What about you Miguel? I think the reason the reason Barks think about cheese when I am hear about no because he lived in Minnesota for his mere prepared of time. And apparently, there was a little cheese

261
00:31:21,205 --> 00:31:23,225
cheese instructor her, named Larson

262
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:28,232
or larson cheese. And it might be the... From there, I got this

263
00:31:28,968 --> 00:31:32,699
new information about norwegian because there many

264
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:45,470
reaching immigrants moved minnesota Right. Start living there. Yeah. So they they grab their sack, their lunch sac, and Donald will notice that it feels a little bit heavier than it should, and they

265
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:52,164
discover they don't know that... Yet, that it's a lemon, but we're introduced to the landing of the title.

266
00:31:52,662 --> 00:32:11,731
And and so he's a really funny little animal. Right? It's it's funny when Barks plays around with quote real animals. In his funny animal stories. But he's like very or. He's always coming in, like a fighting pose that deluxe are gonna learn he's very clever, but also very skit. And,

267
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:19,928
you know, he's eating all the cheese in the bag. And they're they're a bit curious about it so they decide they un unable

268
00:32:20,663 --> 00:32:23,133
decide that they're gonna ask Uncle Scrooge

269
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:24,085
about

270
00:32:25,062 --> 00:32:28,353
blaming. Him key being a a man of the world.

271
00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:37,550
And you guys... I I think I could have predicted Scrooge is reaction immediately. It's it's pretty... It's it's a little silly that the Nephews

272
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:49,185
think he has any interest in, like, an animal and isn't gonna react this way. But it definitely works for the story progression. Right? Yeah. Barks us to introduce chaos into the screw office.

273
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:56,520
Right. And and that that's a great point, Miguel, because Scrooge that were set up with this nice orderly

274
00:32:57,097 --> 00:33:19,890
system that Scrooge has here and and now he's just gonna throw it into array. So Scrooge does react to the way we expect him to he pretty much only ever thinks about animals as environments that want to destroy his money One of you guys mentioned them how ridiculous the idea is that this little rodents

275
00:33:20,229 --> 00:33:23,006
could chew his way through the in imp

276
00:33:23,466 --> 00:33:35,529
den. But Scrooge just freaks out and he he makes the situation worse by panic. This something I always tell my kids. Right? If you're If you're upset, take a moment

277
00:33:35,945 --> 00:33:41,525
to make sure you stay calm because Panic can always makes the situation worse.

278
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:52,345
And Ruben, do you wanna tell us how his panic makes this situation worse? Well, he started chasing the rat as they call it around the office. And

279
00:33:52,803 --> 00:34:25,875
it jumps on top of the chair, that screws previously used to stand on when hanging the on top of his statue himself and also setting up this same for equipment because it jumps on top of that chair onto to add the. The statue you and Gladstone to that statue tips over with the lemon into the into the floor, the statue breaks, and falls of it and on to the living make right. And and so we've got... We've got our setup right guys for the whole rest of the story. It's... It's going to become a chase

280
00:34:26,294 --> 00:34:32,746
story. We're getting at all these little chase sequences the rest of the way. So he knows where he's going with this.

281
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:35,156
You guys this sequence

282
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:39,821
seemed to me like something that would probably work better.

283
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:43,784
Right? It's hard to depict this kind of like, frantic

284
00:34:44,638 --> 00:34:45,138
motion

285
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:57,466
effectively. But does a pretty good job here, but this strikes me as like a story board where you're like, oh, this still look really good once we realize it as a car too. I agree. The the necklace itself

286
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:18,198
actually is too small to wrap around the big let head So I believe that would work better and some type animation. Yeah. There there's a little bit of cartoon and logic gets it there. What do you think we miguel? No. I really agree that this is very much an internet story, and it also becomes very clear once they get to the ship, try to catch just wrecked. Yeah. The that part is

287
00:35:18,615 --> 00:35:20,391
is basically animation still.

288
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:26,209
Exactly. It's gonna be... It's gonna be that very slaps stick. So the Ducktales

289
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:37,152
Scrooge explains the importance of what he has in the locket and the fact that he can't remember one combination let alone service. Screws panic kinda scares the skit

290
00:35:37,931 --> 00:35:53,443
le, the skit rodent into jumping out the window. And and at that point, they have no choice but to, you know, pursue him. And he Barks a ship with the ava evo name, the Moon golf, you know, at this point, He also...

291
00:35:53,981 --> 00:35:58,849
And so, you know, the Ducktales feel like they've got him corner and they head to the docks.

292
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:00,445
But, of course,

293
00:36:01,218 --> 00:36:07,223
they are just a little bit too late and and it has taken off. And Miguel, you wanna tell us about

294
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:17,055
change with the sale there? Well, screws is coming down running and then you see this sale run. It shows hey, sailor. Where that Scrooge going? And the sailor Al

295
00:36:17,669 --> 00:36:25,654
transfer who knows fishing go everywhere the cactus have an next call it goes very points fish is next porch. Of

296
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:27,750
Casablanca.

297
00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:39,138
Yeah. So I like the setup. Right? This the... It feels very hope list. It feels like the the saying in in English would be... It feels like a needle in a haystack.

298
00:36:39,596 --> 00:36:42,110
So it it really does feel hopeless.

299
00:36:42,564 --> 00:36:50,207
And so the the setup is very exciting. Next we get to, like a sequence where he charter a helicopter

300
00:36:51,440 --> 00:37:06,107
but a fog Barks ends up foil him and they have to turn back. I'm not gonna go into too much detail every little bit here. Right? And and, basically, Barks is doing a really good job of of of setting up this logical

301
00:37:06,566 --> 00:37:07,005
progression.

302
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:10,353
For why they're gonna end up following the le

303
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:26,290
back to its home. And so as they ponder this dilemma. The Nephews have a really good idea. Ruben, you wanna tell us their their suggestion to Scrooge. Yeah. I just have a simple idea. That just the scooter will land some place

304
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:29,650
notify every sea in the world to hold the

305
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:42,915
theirs and a Scrooge just pair like, oh, that's simple. That will. Yeah. I I really liked that because, like, sometimes in in these stories they... It it annoys me when they don't come up with the most logical

306
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:56,217
next step, that really is exactly what he should do. In this situation, I feel like. Right? It's it's a good next step. And so it leads to this passage of time where weeks later

307
00:37:56,529 --> 00:38:05,940
Right, We imagine Scrooge has been been just incredibly stress over this passage of time. He gets the notification that they're done with their fishing,

308
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:07,734
and they're being held

309
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:09,695
in herring tail

310
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:16,148
Norway. And and sp does this great thing where like, he's always having the Ducktales pack up

311
00:38:16,486 --> 00:38:26,394
prepared on a moment notice. I've gotta imagine guys that at some point, they just keep standing suitcases for one Scrooge is like, come on. We're getting on the plane. That reservation.

312
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:27,869
And and,

313
00:38:28,587 --> 00:38:30,563
why don't you tell us about their

314
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:42,285
conversation? Oh, go ahead Ruben, you had some and... Yeah. I just wanna tell, you know, I had Al plane book. That's right. The book is called fly or pre in region and it's by kids

315
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:45,079
nordic in two thousand fourteen. And

316
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:49,389
it tells that the airplane they used to... It says it's on analog

317
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:56,560
cancellation it was produced from nineteen forty three to nineteen fifty eight and was used for cross atlantic travel

318
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,935
index in this

319
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:01,851
fly is written by call and clear

320
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:08,936
by or or the evaluation... The norwegian and aviation museum very cool. It's amazing how

321
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:13,721
the length that Barks went to to get his aircraft accurate.

322
00:39:14,258 --> 00:39:14,758
So

323
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:17,724
Nico miguel, why don't you tell us about their approach

324
00:39:18,062 --> 00:39:34,749
and just kinda your impressions of our our first glimpse of Norway and what the Ducktales talking about. Well, so do son no or the plane and then screws explained that they're holding to ship in the forge and they will board border shape and find that rats. And then one of the nephew Nephews

325
00:39:35,365 --> 00:39:43,177
tell that if is still a board, and Scrooge don't expands that's tedious the crew man have seen him, and then nephews

326
00:39:43,676 --> 00:39:46,213
claim that your troubles will soon be over uncle.

327
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:48,270
I don't think probably will be Al

328
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:59,596
right. And and we get them arriving at herring tale, I'm gonna guess you guys that this is a sectional place name. Oh, no. Harry is beautiful I area should go.

329
00:40:00,215 --> 00:40:05,070
I interesting that hair tale is basically the same name as Colbert houston in

330
00:40:05,824 --> 00:40:12,117
the special panel of the Golden Helmet with the the old viking shipping they're in her Norway. That's

331
00:40:12,896 --> 00:40:17,570
use this name. It's a lovely little drawing of this fishing village. But this is

332
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,530
we really nailed the the western coast

333
00:40:21,844 --> 00:40:50,325
looked of this place. Yeah I was gonna ask you guys because to me it looks very realistic. It looks very evo about it, but I I wouldn't know. Well. Well, I wanna say, like, from a distance, the the small village and the mountains around it. And it looks it looks pretty accurate. I clint looks like this could be like somewhere over the the west far away. Yeah. And and so our next sequence is that one that we were alluding to a little bit earlier where it's this really slaps stick

334
00:40:50,702 --> 00:40:51,202
series

335
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,755
of them trying to catch

336
00:40:54,172 --> 00:40:57,880
the le. I guess they're still calling him a rat at this point.

337
00:40:58,735 --> 00:40:59,555
It's it's

338
00:40:59,855 --> 00:41:01,715
it's a bunch of comic mayhem.

339
00:41:02,455 --> 00:41:29,730
You know, I'm not necessarily too interested in in the specifics of these pratt falls. It's it's fun. But, again, it kind of brings me back to Donald duck finds pirate gold where, like it it really does feel a little bit like an animation story board. No one beats sparks when he's drawing, like, these naval scenes on top of shit you know, he does such great detail where on the ship.

340
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:39,465
You know, but there's pratt falls with the harpoon gun and a polly and and Scrooge getting dizzy running up on on the circular platform that I guess

341
00:41:40,205 --> 00:41:43,799
more modern ships would have instead of a crow nest. And eventually,

342
00:41:44,218 --> 00:41:53,279
they start to get smart because as the captain has mentioned, this rodent is is very craft. So they try to

343
00:41:53,737 --> 00:41:58,925
lure him with a piece of that cheese. You know, he returns to this cheese.

344
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,800
One of you guys wanna tell us about the top hat sequence.

345
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,933
Yeah. They still call it them the rest So one of the nephew

346
00:42:08,312 --> 00:42:24,093
explain that brother is really disappeared. Along the guru asks where d hide that we haven't looked then one nephew spot with lan and say that he's not in the board and anymore uncle Scrooge. There he goes. Sailing in your hats. And another Scrooge explains

347
00:42:24,512 --> 00:42:37,540
that and that has cost me two dollars in nineteen ten, and this is of course, one detail that Donna rosa would later through use and the life and financial subscription deck by showing skill actually actually buying this hat in. Yeah.

348
00:42:38,816 --> 00:42:39,316
It's

349
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:40,251
detail.

350
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:41,405
No

351
00:42:41,945 --> 00:42:45,845
far. Yeah. So you guys this that little moment where

352
00:42:46,425 --> 00:43:09,160
where the rodent is is sneaking around under the hat that feels very, like, donald Duck Cartoon to me. They're not not in the best way. It's not not my favorite sequence. But does work to get him to get him over to shore. Right? Because he's got this convenient little boat. What do you think rubin? And I agree toll because like, they're all sweating they're all looking at the

353
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,920
pizza cheese that are put floor and they're all all the

354
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:37,172
and all the nephews are standing with minutes rated to catch that. And then Scrooge head just come crawling or what is sliding or around along the deck? It is very donald duck part tony. To me. And it's not so much that the le is that smart but more that the other characters are being a little bit well stupid in this one. Exactly. So so the next sequence is the Ducktales going

355
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:44,540
to to follow the le And they passed by a couple of little local Barks kids.

356
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:57,595
Right? And and you guys I imagine, this is Barb wanting to give some flavor of local people. I will give you my impression as an American is that Number one, these kids do look very stereotypical typically scan

357
00:43:58,095 --> 00:44:03,139
me. Number two, they're they're they're drawn kinda creepy. They are really crazy.

358
00:44:03,617 --> 00:44:07,954
It's so Al it's the dollar eyes. And you wants to highlight the blue eyes

359
00:44:08,652 --> 00:44:13,939
their blue iris, and therefore it's drawn the pupils and very very small. Yeah. They're very

360
00:44:14,356 --> 00:44:14,715
unsettling.

361
00:44:15,328 --> 00:44:16,546
Lucky. I always.

362
00:44:16,884 --> 00:44:27,255
I thought that kid and I failed thinking Yeah. And bricks really could draw kids, like in the pool Barks story have kids who feel like kids to this more realistic,

363
00:44:28,355 --> 00:44:30,394
kind of and genuinely Al. Yeah. Yeah.

364
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:32,255
Everything

365
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:33,894
But like to,

366
00:44:34,315 --> 00:44:41,829
like they're clothing and their parents. Like in that way, that's actually accurate. Nice you talk talk about it being

367
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:49,557
the girl is wearing some kind of know the inspired clothing. And I think the boy is wearing typical fifties

368
00:44:50,096 --> 00:44:57,324
small region ish clothing and both wearing boots, standing and fishing. I think that's pretty accurate. Yeah. The she and the girl is wearing this

369
00:44:57,942 --> 00:45:02,173
simplify the hard on not cactus kind of and alone that's just to capital...

370
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:06,682
Yes you said needed that maybe? Yeah. Yeah. That's true. And.

371
00:45:07,698 --> 00:45:39,959
So the... At least these creepy looking kids are able to finally tell us what what the rat is. That that he is Al lemon. They're like, oh, you mean that lending with the lock we did see it going through the village toward the up land trail and and you know, the steaks keep going up. This is becoming more and more like a needle in a hay tax scenario. And as the docks get into the village, we get a predictable, but very cool sequence where each of them thinks he has found the le

372
00:45:40,734 --> 00:45:43,784
because what what they're seeing is one of these

373
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:44,621
migrations

374
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:45,776
or

375
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:51,189
as I read someone referred to it, It's not so much a migration, but a

376
00:45:51,609 --> 00:45:58,015
dispersed. The the animals are being just dispersed because of, like, food pressure is what really happens.

377
00:45:58,614 --> 00:46:02,844
But whatever you call it, it is one of these great lemons on the move.

378
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:03,959
Events.

379
00:46:04,419 --> 00:46:06,059
And and the Inducks,

380
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:15,004
you know, they have to like. They're looking checking for line kits on all of these le and it's seeming more and more hopeless and one of them...

381
00:46:15,342 --> 00:46:18,889
One of them angrily bites Donald finger, and then and then he gets

382
00:46:19,389 --> 00:46:28,304
swarmed. It's it's a fun panel. It's a good... It's what we wanna see happen to Donald. I'm sorry donald. This. It's very accurate as well because lending are famous

383
00:46:28,804 --> 00:46:36,036
because or their fan for being angry. And there's yeah little myth that I can explode with anger and just flat all lower.

384
00:46:37,954 --> 00:46:40,664
Not through that. They it has been the.

385
00:46:41,162 --> 00:46:41,662
But

386
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:42,598
compared to, like,

387
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:48,702
both creditors and also skiing norwegian skin and hiking

388
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:55,785
migrations up in the mountains. So I believe some people have been bitten or probably many people have done

389
00:46:56,202 --> 00:46:59,113
by by while hiking in the summertime time the.

390
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:00,849
Yeah. They

391
00:47:01,506 --> 00:47:03,500
they might be small, but They have they're ferocious.

392
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:10,114
So, yeah, it seems like a good choice for the story. Ruben, do you wanna tell us about the Nephew little d tour?

393
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:12,789
I just want to highlight

394
00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:22,274
panel where the kids are pointing to watch the city. So first, I just wanna ask you Barks, what do you think about the scandinavian architecture here? This scan

395
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:26,549
architecture... I get a good look at it mostly from that

396
00:47:26,968 --> 00:47:31,318
panel with the two kids pointing toward that plan trail. I'm.

397
00:47:32,137 --> 00:47:35,114
Right. I mean, first off, it looks very

398
00:47:35,613 --> 00:47:35,933
picturesque.

399
00:47:36,692 --> 00:47:44,324
I noticed that a lot of the houses seem to have, like, pretty steep gable roofs for for snow. I assume.

400
00:47:44,744 --> 00:47:51,802
Yeah. There's nothing about it. That's standing out as being... It it kinda looks generic northern Western

401
00:47:52,657 --> 00:48:06,046
European me. There's nothing about it. That looks like, I would be able to identify it. Al Norwegian. I find it kind of more German looking in some ways. So I like this little detail that for said with the stay and state church

402
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:11,891
dragon heads or brothers spikes that he has added on the rooftop sir? To... I guess

403
00:48:12,268 --> 00:48:13,065
guess Huey,

404
00:48:13,384 --> 00:48:23,335
mistakenly thought this was a very normal norwegian way to decorate rates the rooftop. Yeah. I think that's great. Still is a Barks word Barks

405
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:24,294
phrase. It's a great catch.

406
00:48:25,093 --> 00:48:28,684
But I just wanna say that to me, it also just feels like this generic

407
00:48:29,264 --> 00:48:43,163
European type. It's it looks more like dutch and twists and German to me than actually scandinavia. But the... I I can't do you kind forgive it because I can see how americans would find it hard to differentiate

408
00:48:43,862 --> 00:48:44,362
different

409
00:48:44,781 --> 00:48:54,584
architecture type I I think he's made a good effort for at least. Yeah. If it it's okay. So why don't you tell us about the little d tour? Al the nephew take. I will

410
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:09,206
that they've been searching for a long time, So they wanna... What that you says, let's find the store where we can buy some of that you cheese. And then they see that little store which by the way, that's accurate or reaching Barks architecture right there.

411
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:13,014
Where I sell that cheese, that is called large,

412
00:49:13,632 --> 00:49:15,409
or large cheese and.

413
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:27,494
Just like the point out Barks really went through great lengths and is written sign in the region. Exactly only made one little mistake with Al drop because was or now larson

414
00:49:27,848 --> 00:49:32,192
it's just written in one word and working in the in norwegian. Not mushrooms.

415
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:38,212
That's true. And I also go inside that cheese store, and we could also mention that.

416
00:49:38,991 --> 00:49:45,325
Inside the cheese store, I... There are more no norwegian Barks. There are two piles of cheese that says no

417
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:57,503
That would be a north cheese. I don't know that one. And close to the viewer, there are also two packages of app. Tools that would be coke cheese. I believe it's the problem cheese maybe. And also I see that was

418
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,975
a my edition they called red

419
00:50:00,392 --> 00:50:01,171
behind the

420
00:50:01,508 --> 00:50:04,258
the goat cheese. That looks like some sort of

421
00:50:04,717 --> 00:50:28,594
or maybe Iceberg and they see that big pile of or the big kind they call it of a whole cape of that type of cheese they like very much. So that buy that for for almost nothing because the guy who owns this he expects the will eat up in store time one of the you say. So they run away with this big problem. That I love so much, and that will be their food for the rest of me week maybe.

422
00:50:29,671 --> 00:50:35,997
Yeah. That would... That much cheese makes my stomach hurt. Although, I I do love me a good goat cheese.

423
00:50:37,036 --> 00:50:51,790
But I I really like I like their very clever solution, right? How to keep it safe. That they suspend it hanging in mid air from a a telephone wire. Which, of course, is gonna become very important. Also like the covers.

424
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:54,787
With the new rules he wrote it into

425
00:50:55,166 --> 00:51:00,360
different ways. Both in one word, new, and you also used it with

426
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:06,550
with the hyphen just to be sure that Huey, at least one of them most the correct spelling. Right. And, you know,

427
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:13,377
it's worth really highlighting that it's cool that he got that right. Because, like, he didn't have Google translate.

428
00:51:14,036 --> 00:51:34,180
The way that I did. So he had to go to some effort to to figure that out. Right? And on some of his stories, Huey, he uses kinda like native lingo for some characters and another stories. He like goes to more pains to get it right. So he obviously was interested in having this be at least a little bit like a travel lobby.

429
00:51:34,793 --> 00:51:36,490
So as the nephews

430
00:51:37,266 --> 00:51:37,766
recon

431
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:46,558
with their uncles, you know, Scrooge is telling them to come on that they're heading up towards that up lens trail, and they're pondering

432
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:49,155
how they are seeing more and more le.

433
00:51:49,494 --> 00:51:59,245
As they go get along, and they encounter a local that tells them you haven't seen anything. Yeah. Wait until you get up on the farmland land above very ominous.

434
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:08,361
And, you know, this is one of those cases where I don't have to like think about how the characters can all speak to them in English because, like, most Norwegian

435
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:11,883
speak very good English. Well, thank you.

436
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:24,221
So also I just want to notice that the the guy informed them about this. I believe you may be escaping or running away from towel, but it looks like that it's it's a great accurate

437
00:52:25,155 --> 00:52:32,098
representation of an norwegian hike Alright. So you guys were we're gradually getting to the, like, really big

438
00:52:32,836 --> 00:52:45,172
anticipated sequence here. It's it's easy to imagine that this is what Barks really wanted to lead up to. The whole time I I think in a lot of these stories. He has a a moment

439
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:52,077
that he's really starting with. Right? Because the Nephews are gonna see these trails of of le

440
00:52:52,455 --> 00:52:52,895
converging.

441
00:52:53,308 --> 00:52:53,808
And

442
00:52:54,664 --> 00:52:55,841
one of them ominous

443
00:52:56,258 --> 00:53:09,217
says there must be a big band of them where all these runs of le get together. And as they crest this hill part, we see this. And it's a it's a very cool

444
00:53:10,209 --> 00:53:11,309
extremely memorable

445
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:16,349
splash panel. We see what seems to be millions

446
00:53:17,103 --> 00:53:23,546
you know, this this might be that exploration for their exploration of what does a billion of something look like

447
00:53:24,122 --> 00:53:24,622
Moving

448
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:26,696
across the side

449
00:53:27,049 --> 00:53:28,028
like a blanket.

450
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:38,822
And and as a reader we're thinking, wow. We're we're thinking they're... They must be eating everything in their path. But most of all, we're thinking about the impossibility

451
00:53:39,281 --> 00:53:40,380
the en normally

452
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:46,588
of this task of finding this one lemon in that teaming mass

453
00:53:46,927 --> 00:53:47,867
and knowing

454
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:57,602
what is about we're we're gonna find out what is about to come. Thoughts you guys? Well, if cob didn't have to that billion bottle caps in Al

455
00:53:58,878 --> 00:54:01,231
sure they get that. Huge hair.

456
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:07,131
Right. Absolutely. It's a great flash panel left. I probably saw this splash panel

457
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:10,801
way before I read the store. Because was published in some.

458
00:54:11,433 --> 00:54:21,479
Talk about oh, the norwegian Barks story. Ninth great. I love it. And also you further there miguel. We chatted the for the podcast and you're talked about about some coloring

459
00:54:21,896 --> 00:54:23,153
where the not norwegian

460
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:28,674
whether of the west coast is accurate and harry actually

461
00:54:29,014 --> 00:54:32,074
grew of a big pile of wind and

462
00:54:32,694 --> 00:54:35,369
and clouds and that's again, glitch for

463
00:54:35,788 --> 00:54:37,246
the western Norway

464
00:54:37,944 --> 00:54:45,222
western norwegian climate. I just like to point out that the example you've been mentioned with the the caller is the Gladstone,

465
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,040
Album

466
00:54:47,653 --> 00:54:55,581
no norwegian sky is pretty gray and, yeah, that's very accurate for the best western cons that's inside of Norway. This always raining there

467
00:54:56,038 --> 00:54:59,568
Nice. Also, I would just like to add that I exactly we

468
00:54:59,905 --> 00:55:15,229
Barks that this probably is like I believe Barks and many of these stories have this like panel like it wants to visualize and often the of page slash panel. And I'll just love the idea of thinking about how Barks come up with this idea. Yeah. You can't

469
00:55:15,606 --> 00:55:32,710
you can't identify it on every story. But there's definitely a handful of them where like Oh, that... That's what you wanted to do here. What do you think we can? Yeah. I think Ports really did a good job here, this especially family. We certainly got some help from National geographic because in August nineteen

470
00:55:33,128 --> 00:55:35,304
fifty four, there was article particular about

471
00:55:35,722 --> 00:55:37,074
describing a American

472
00:55:37,533 --> 00:55:41,783
and taking a sale tour from post to Bargain And

473
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:42,820
I was

474
00:55:43,197 --> 00:55:44,269
nineteen fifty four

475
00:55:44,609 --> 00:56:02,856
the national Geographic Magazine also has some picture from lisa, where there was this rates alan and picture of where. Of a man looking out Al least view, and you can see that a picture was played Al huge role and it's inspiring Barks for his panel. Yeah. Thanks for earth that. We'll we'll make sure to put that up

476
00:56:03,195 --> 00:56:15,959
on the Facebook page for sure. It's a it's a great panel. It's one his most iconic I would say for a reason, it's a probably a big part of why people remember this story fondly on a.

477
00:56:16,857 --> 00:56:28,954
And also I also like how we see the Inducks from the back camry we like units from the same view as the Inducks. Definitely agree. It's a great perspective shot. That choice he makes there is is excellent.

478
00:56:29,614 --> 00:56:41,349
And I really like the sequence that follows. Right? The the sequence that follows is is just really about the futility of what they're trying to do. It's about Barks,

479
00:56:42,163 --> 00:56:43,341
surrounding them

480
00:56:43,718 --> 00:56:45,375
with all of these,

481
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:49,004
like, mindless, the ram paging le.

482
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:54,043
It's about Scrooge just bearing, you know, there's a moment where donald

483
00:56:54,460 --> 00:57:02,591
votes that they just give up because it's a lost cause. There's a funny Al little bit where he provides all the votes by saying, I I I.

484
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:10,349
And and we get to see Scrooge looking both, like, it's it's both funny, but it's also very sad as he's

485
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:18,493
commenting that he can't give up. He'd sit penn lists and starving outside the door is safe with two hundred and fifty

486
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,704
fabulous trillion dollars

487
00:57:21,203 --> 00:57:24,260
inside that couldn't touch. Yeah. I also likes

488
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:30,287
with at that's Scrooge is not invisible. He has this breakdown on that makes him view.

489
00:57:30,806 --> 00:57:32,682
It's not always on top of things. Right.

490
00:57:33,441 --> 00:57:44,743
That's a really good thing Barks there. Definitely it. To me it evo the moment in horse rash. Story. We're just basically saying I I can't give up. I have no choice. I I nothing.

491
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:56,975
Otherwise. Because this He is his fortune basic. And, you know, this sequence is so cool. The le are like this rolling wave that that's basically eating everything in their path

492
00:57:57,514 --> 00:57:59,652
they pass another person

493
00:57:59,991 --> 00:58:02,809
fleeing with a chest of whatever world

494
00:58:03,867 --> 00:58:12,493
he could get and and the states go up here because they've never really had the chance to, like, learn about Le. And so Scrooge asks,

495
00:58:13,632 --> 00:58:21,785
mister what causes this flood of le. Do you want it ruben do you wanna share his response? I can I can do bit reach and accent actually?

496
00:58:22,862 --> 00:58:29,590
This go for it. So he he asked you know, mister her, what causes is this flood of le? Says Scrooge.

497
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:30,570
No.

498
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:37,065
We just get out way every few years they leave their homes and start watching Al your

499
00:58:38,245 --> 00:58:40,225
migration, maybe they're be

500
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:56,562
which, Maybe they're only looking for more and different food. They more everything in their involved awesome. They're do the go. They keep going until they reach this team. And not even that stops the the plug of the clips into the rails and swim

501
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,935
bone Severino goes back to the mountains.

502
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:11,520
So it's a great setup of what the steaks are, even if it's definitely playing into this, you know, myth. Even if even if none of that true. The fact that there... His lock is on Al le.

503
00:59:11,959 --> 00:59:12,459
It's

504
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:23,502
it's still an impossible task base And and I like the desperation over the next couple of pages. The dots are trying all these last ditch

505
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:24,620
attempts

506
00:59:25,773 --> 00:59:26,273
And

507
00:59:26,732 --> 00:59:41,774
I I love this sequence. And for whatever reason even though this is very slap stick. It just works for me so much better than the ship stuff. Maybe it's because of the urgency, maybe it's because of all the le.

508
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:56,230
I I can't place it. But but I love it. Right? The they're, like, building these walls, what do you think rubin? Yeah. And also it feels way more dramatic now because you can really see how, like they see the serious

509
00:59:56,730 --> 01:00:03,998
and to see how how the task is because there was only that one learning on the ship that I need to catch and what's this

510
01:00:04,336 --> 01:00:11,114
mouse type of thumb. But there it is more hard like like even in the haystack and they and it's a moving haystack. And

511
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:12,429
if the haystack

512
01:00:12,846 --> 01:00:22,729
reaches the ocean, they'll never see it again. And also like, Scrooge tests and what the ritter it thinks it's like this is truly a nightmare. There Barks so many

513
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:27,130
I have to check out each one but are so many and they're moving so fast

514
01:00:27,549 --> 01:00:35,050
So it's really just that and it's section nightmare. The experiences says. Yeah. That... That's the word for it. Right? It's hopeless.

515
01:00:35,744 --> 01:00:40,679
And really feel the clock is ticking. Right. There this great sense of urgency.

516
01:00:41,218 --> 01:00:49,197
The the lam keep devour everything that the Ducktales are trying to do to help. Right? As they go to get a view up up a tall tree,

517
01:00:49,734 --> 01:00:52,547
they they they devour it down, essentially,

518
01:00:53,323 --> 01:00:56,695
likewise a hay stack and nephew goes to look up there.

519
01:00:57,655 --> 01:00:59,435
They try to build walls

520
01:00:59,735 --> 01:01:05,686
to stop them. You guys I really like these panels where they're just, like, hopeless

521
01:01:06,063 --> 01:01:08,119
trying to bat them backwards

522
01:01:08,935 --> 01:01:10,752
with switches with branches.

523
01:01:11,703 --> 01:01:15,393
And we see them plunging into the seat. We see the inevitable

524
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:16,568
thing happen.

525
01:01:16,966 --> 01:01:29,430
I like that we do see them attempting to swim, you know? So there's none of this, like, they're they're not trying to commit suicide or anything like that. But but they are this un unstoppable

526
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:31,044
force And

527
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:34,234
after hours past, you see

528
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,825
screws, just kind of pitiful

529
01:01:37,362 --> 01:01:38,221
half hearted

530
01:01:38,638 --> 01:01:41,185
looking at the last few str wars

531
01:01:41,562 --> 01:01:42,779
as they pass.

532
01:01:43,673 --> 01:01:46,125
And Miguel, do you wanna tell us about the

533
01:01:46,501 --> 01:02:00,098
splash the mini splash panel that expands the page at the bottom. Scrooge door we're overlooking this the ocean and looks so waste and all this naked clips and the sea goes flying and don't just say their gone on.

534
01:02:00,515 --> 01:02:03,209
The last of the millions has gone over the clips.

535
01:02:03,546 --> 01:02:04,064
And Scrooge

536
01:02:04,622 --> 01:02:19,028
say yes. And the last of my has come with them. This a great panel. It makes him you. It makes the reader just so, I this Yeah. It's very Barks it it feels it's devastating. Right? And the way their shadows

537
01:02:19,365 --> 01:02:20,343
are are

538
01:02:20,681 --> 01:02:25,145
being cast now gives us the idea that time is asked and

539
01:02:25,485 --> 01:02:28,905
everything that that works really well. Box was really

540
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:37,068
informed of you from of using these shadows to really drive on the point of hopelessness. So we also use starting home world man.

541
01:02:37,604 --> 01:02:39,517
Just lost this fortune to the bagel boys.

542
01:02:40,194 --> 01:02:48,380
Just before it gets that right Id. But Harry, he doesn't get any right And how to save his fortune he's through the last and then screwed

543
01:02:49,160 --> 01:03:01,395
I will bear my property like a mom. I will be brave in the face of disaster. I won't cry and then he just boils down to the ground and starts sobbing and holding and don't stay this standard.

544
01:03:01,935 --> 01:03:02,775
Not much that is.

545
01:03:03,549 --> 01:03:15,410
It's it's a good comic be. It's pretty predictable, but but it's it's very funny. And sp just looks very different seated here and And then Ruben, do you wanna tell us about how the nephews

546
01:03:16,988 --> 01:03:21,097
decide to cheer him up and and what they discover? Yeah. They just...

547
01:03:22,033 --> 01:03:29,605
The letters, I just suddenly remember that that the cheese they're hanging from the phone wire. So they go get that to Up

548
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:33,717
chairs and man that I most to remember the Federal Lil

549
01:03:34,174 --> 01:03:58,505
or something dollars, more than a decent cheese. So they're hoping it's still there And when they come there, they are shocked to see that it's a big hole in the chase, and it's also a airway way build up sticks. That's leaning up from the ground up to it. So when they come closer, and I see the how is about the size of a living and the left other that response yes.

550
01:03:59,143 --> 01:04:13,980
Lending... There's only one living in the world smart enough to figure out this their setup up. So they look inside and they see that exact living with the login around it the view don't see it. But is the... But one of the left tells the viewer the other,

551
01:04:14,399 --> 01:04:25,801
of course, that his name there, And he's just been eating so much they can't get out of that hole he just and can tell but. You guys this part works, I think fabulous.

552
01:04:27,215 --> 01:04:30,307
This is such a great solution. It's it's

553
01:04:30,818 --> 01:04:33,111
super unlikely, it's super coincidental

554
01:04:33,608 --> 01:04:38,505
that there's something very funny about the idea of this Clever little room and

555
01:04:38,964 --> 01:04:50,291
the the Clever Little rodent eating his way into being too big to escape. I I like this element of the story a lot. We don't usually see the Nephews have the w

556
01:04:50,907 --> 01:04:58,997
exclamation I don't think. Right? I think that's mostly a donald thing. That baby. I don't know. I won't fat check yet. But And also...

557
01:04:59,934 --> 01:05:08,653
About something we don't see nephew due to often but when I discovered this, one of the nephews gels Barks Scrooge, and it runs towards this location.

558
01:05:09,492 --> 01:05:22,050
And I believe that is you read us. It says stop. Wait. Let's tell him just yet because if we work this so right, we may be able to get a rich reward we're finding the log So actually try to up trick Scrooge

559
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:37,105
giving them some... But maybe they get some reaches from this. And they other... And yeah. How does the other that he respond? It's it's a funny gag. It's so funny. It's a funny line. He says we're we're only Inducks, not magicians, but I'm with you.

560
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:48,045
So I like that too. Yeah. You're right. We don't usually see them be a little bit greedy. But on the other hand, they... As far as I concerned, they definitely

561
01:05:48,462 --> 01:05:52,550
deserve a rich reward here. Kinda reminds me of

562
01:05:52,928 --> 01:05:53,428
horse

563
01:05:53,924 --> 01:05:59,982
story right where they're going to some length to make sure that they can collect their wages.

564
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:06,501
Yeah. True. This this time non Scrooge not even paying them thirty cents an hour. They're not any payments.

565
01:06:07,193 --> 01:06:09,845
Yeah. We haven't heard it. I think we can imagine

566
01:06:10,181 --> 01:06:19,983
maybe there too... They they feel too guilty to... I guess it's probably contingent. His... Their wages are gonna be contingent on him getting into that safe, obviously.

567
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:21,099
So

568
01:06:21,516 --> 01:06:26,101
the the story is then I can include. And what looks like a a relatively

569
01:06:26,439 --> 01:06:38,775
nice... I guess it's not a restaurant. It must be like the the dining room of the in that they're standing at. And they've set up that cheese. And, you know, Donald is looking really cheerful.

570
01:06:39,433 --> 01:06:43,025
He may or may not be in on what the nephews have planned,

571
01:06:44,363 --> 01:07:05,788
but he at least looks excited to to be sitting down and ready to go home Scrooge is just looking desolate and the nephews are looking very, like, right and and sure of themselves because of what they've got planned. And and so as they prepare to dig into that cheese, they they start to kinda talk up a deal

572
01:07:06,247 --> 01:07:06,747
asking

573
01:07:07,126 --> 01:07:22,768
him if you were to... If if we were to suddenly find your lock for you, how big a reward would you give us? And fridge kind of gestures that he would give them a chunk of gold three feet around and six inches

574
01:07:23,161 --> 01:07:26,461
thick. And the Net Barks satisfied they've heard enough

575
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,981
so they do their big reveal.

576
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:39,627
They flip over the cheese with has, like, a little trap door that they seem to have blocked the the le in there with. And they reveal him

577
01:07:40,046 --> 01:07:40,801
and he is

578
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:50,758
still just incredibly full. I I imagine the inside of that cheese would be pretty gross by that point, guys. Yeah. Problem probably.

579
01:07:51,294 --> 01:07:52,233
I I know.

580
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:53,986
Also,

581
01:07:54,442 --> 01:07:57,685
the purpose is I think bubbles so thinking that is working.

582
01:07:58,203 --> 01:08:03,446
Yeah. That's great. He's got a little burp sound effect, but only inside his own little le head.

583
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:10,456
And and he looks very funny and Scrooge of course, is delighted and he calls out the title.

584
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:12,456
The le with the locket

585
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:15,308
And Let living with my.

586
01:08:16,046 --> 01:08:20,101
Yes. Excuse me. Not quite the title. The landing with my lock

587
01:08:20,575 --> 01:08:26,075
And and that that is our ending. We get a brief little comic cap.

588
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:29,075
Mi miguel, you wanna tell us about the the nephews

589
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:38,325
getting their reward. Yeah. So uncle Scrooge gets well again and the boys get their reward. Unless the Barks is boarding the home board

590
01:08:38,926 --> 01:08:53,412
Line. You didn't carry a big wheel of cheese. And one of the nephews with annual faces. At cheese. That's the reward. Right on just like on Scrooge promise It's three feet around and six inches six. And is gold

591
01:08:53,844 --> 01:08:59,327
all the way through caller that is. And one of them is... One of them is saying it,

592
01:09:00,182 --> 01:09:02,810
What what of them are saying you'd like long.

593
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:09,930
Yeah. Not. And one of them just find money Yeah Yeah. And find it funny is actually the one who

594
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:11,510
at least in my conversation.

595
01:09:12,564 --> 01:09:21,908
The one time that funny is the one that wasn't in on the idea in the first place or Al least wasn't with baggage. Right. Yeah. They they all have this kind of air of

596
01:09:22,405 --> 01:09:25,433
expiration. Like, what are you gonna do? That's our uncle Scrooge.

597
01:09:26,111 --> 01:09:32,292
Exactly. You guys this the ending doesn't really work that well for me. It's it's a silly

598
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:38,106
thing to say, you know, gold is is clearly not cheese. Cheese is not gold.

599
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:44,134
I get what he's going for there. But I don't know. I don't think it's the most successful

600
01:09:44,792 --> 01:09:47,786
gag that he's ever end with. Kind cheesy.

601
01:09:50,406 --> 01:09:51,706
Whatever it really is.

602
01:09:52,246 --> 01:09:53,566
It's a cheesy joke.

603
01:09:54,619 --> 01:09:55,399
But but...

604
01:09:56,137 --> 01:09:59,972
Like mark, can you please add the sign anything music right after life.

605
01:10:02,945 --> 01:10:04,885
You know the the the actual

606
01:10:05,185 --> 01:10:07,085
ending. The little construction

607
01:10:07,425 --> 01:10:07,925
of

608
01:10:08,265 --> 01:10:12,737
of how they find the le. I do find that very satisfying.

609
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:18,865
I do enjoy the way it wraps up. Otherwise, I I just prefer not to do dwell on this

610
01:10:19,962 --> 01:10:24,609
silly little gag that doesn't live up to a lot of his efforts for me. But

611
01:10:24,986 --> 01:10:35,130
but but that's that's the I with the lock at you guys. I I think we covered the story really nicely. And and now, you know, we can kinda talk about what what

612
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:35,970
how

613
01:10:36,324 --> 01:10:50,510
how do we receive this story? What do you guys think did you enjoy? Do you think it was a good representation of Norway? I mean, that's not obviously the most important. Thing. But what do you think Ruben? Well, as I said earlier, it's like it's true Barks

614
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:57,256
Norway they're in the first place. I love that thought. And this but and the story itself, it's a fun idea.

615
01:10:57,834 --> 01:11:01,861
My love like they're chasing like this animal that is

616
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:19,702
Al lot many aspects of it. I love how like that the of it is Scrooge having it's big fortune not but that they can't reach. It knows where it and everyone knows where it is, but no one can enter. That's what in danger hair. I like that ninety end. Like the idea that they're chasing like it's animal,

617
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:25,335
which has, like, the key to this great great amount but wealth

618
01:11:25,835 --> 01:11:31,575
So that'll of course, I like the fact that there are in More. So I I like kinda know like the panel about

619
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:48,522
know this flash panel, the great one but letting submitting Al a carpet. But just the store itself, it's it's okay. When you see Al the whole thing it's it's okay. It's a pretty good Barks story but not I'm on the greatest than might opinion. No. We could surely just swap out

620
01:11:49,099 --> 01:11:53,167
the text some other characters and the store still kind of work. You just

621
01:11:53,505 --> 01:11:58,355
have something else than the lock combination from Scrooge just have a letter or a

622
01:11:58,893 --> 01:12:02,885
code or something and you could use Mickey or some other characters

623
01:12:03,305 --> 01:12:12,074
I think it's a fine story. It's not not as strong Al the eight previous sample Scrooge ventures. It's fun. And this, of course, very cool that I go to Norway.

624
01:12:12,553 --> 01:12:18,495
Yeah. For sure. I I think I largely agree with you guys, you know, it's a very good very enjoy

625
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:20,532
even very memorable

626
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:31,582
story. It's gonna suffer a little bit compared to some of the recent ones just because they were so good. Right? Because, like, this... And they... And they had deeper Scrooge

627
01:12:32,101 --> 01:12:32,601
themes.

628
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:49,812
Only a poor man and back to the Al can even the horse rather story and control Al. They like really had something to say. They had some big ideas in them. And there's nothing wrong with the fact that this one doesn't. It's just a good solid Scrooge adventure.

629
01:12:50,189 --> 01:13:05,938
And we're gonna get a lot of those. But like thinking about it alongside the... This group of the first ten Scrooge stories that I'm I'm choosing to do that because it's... It makes for a good podcast. I think this one is is like, kinda and middle of the road

630
01:13:06,411 --> 01:13:12,831
as far as the other adventure stories go. Right? I... Just for pure Adventure, nothing touches

631
01:13:13,651 --> 01:13:14,751
secret of Lan.

632
01:13:15,344 --> 01:13:19,632
That's just the the... To me, that's the best of the adventure stories

633
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:21,585
in this early cohort.

634
01:13:22,002 --> 01:13:32,511
And like, I think it's probably a little bit better. I enjoy it a lot more than, like, the mysterious stone ray, which is probably for me the weakest of them.

635
01:13:33,324 --> 01:13:37,457
Likewise, I like it a little bit better than I enjoyed the fabulous

636
01:13:37,795 --> 01:13:38,295
philosopher

637
01:13:38,713 --> 01:13:44,418
stone. But I don't know if it quite holds up to, like the seven cities of S,

638
01:13:44,836 --> 01:13:46,094
which just was

639
01:13:46,472 --> 01:13:48,769
really twisty, and turn

640
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:57,526
and and really memorable as far as and pure adventure stories go. But but for a lot of the reasons that you mentioned,

641
01:13:58,024 --> 01:14:07,519
I I love the... I love the kind of needle and the haystack stack ass expect of it. I love the feeling of despair. And I love what they did with the le

642
01:14:08,296 --> 01:14:08,796
himself

643
01:14:09,214 --> 01:14:11,885
with his journey and and how it eventually

644
01:14:12,266 --> 01:14:15,446
resolved and wrapped up. I think I think it's a good

645
01:14:15,746 --> 01:14:17,885
standard Barks adventure that

646
01:14:18,281 --> 01:14:19,817
is remembered fondly

647
01:14:20,195 --> 01:14:25,361
for reason. Definitely and ask some great visuals as well like that most of the big

648
01:14:25,778 --> 01:14:29,802
panel with living moving as of carpet. That's we'll make it really like

649
01:14:30,218 --> 01:14:32,769
memorable I to say more. Yeah. That's something.

650
01:14:34,045 --> 01:14:38,468
And I think I never get that and I have one le

651
01:14:39,045 --> 01:14:46,645
having to find in that big pile of fleming. I find that very remember. Yeah. The the story has a great hook. First. Sure. Yeah.

652
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:55,145
So, you know, I've compared it a little bit to the other stories from this era. But let's go ahead and check him on what the community

653
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:58,737
actually thinks about this one by looking at Inducks,

654
01:14:59,376 --> 01:15:03,411
you know, the site where people can vote on on what they think.

655
01:15:03,985 --> 01:15:28,346
About these stories, and this one gets a very respectable rating as of of today, it's got a seven point nine out of ten, which makes it good for number fifty one out of all the, like, forty two thousand or so Disney stories that are rated. So I mean, that that kind tracks for me. Right? Because it's people I think have a lot of goodwill for this story because it is an early Scrooge

656
01:15:28,826 --> 01:15:29,226
adventure.

657
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,532
And it just has such a strong memorable

658
01:15:33,109 --> 01:15:36,361
hook. It's a very famous story. So I think it's gonna naturally

659
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:41,002
stand out. I might not rank it white that high myself,

660
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:52,866
but I I don't think that's like, out of bounds. I don't think that's off too too far off track. What you guys think? No. I... Out of the first ten years adventures, I would probably rank this either

661
01:15:53,404 --> 01:15:54,675
last or second last

662
01:15:55,812 --> 01:16:04,327
the the fabulous philosophy Gladstone is of course, very great fresh and story, but I I think that one also is kind of weaker on dates

663
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:18,165
previous stories. I personally like to mister Stone Ray. But of course, none of them really are quite up there with the secret of Ot land or back to the clone or They're just They just kind of go the little extra mile

664
01:16:18,585 --> 01:16:21,685
Yeah. Yeah. I yeah I think it's a strong story

665
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,099
it's good

666
01:16:23,558 --> 01:16:27,973
I really like that Barks sent to. As I previously said the he sent

667
01:16:28,392 --> 01:16:33,757
Norway when it was still in his golden and age when it comes to character drawing. So that's circle.

668
01:16:34,275 --> 01:16:35,374
You know, it's interesting

669
01:16:35,832 --> 01:16:36,332
that

670
01:16:36,749 --> 01:16:41,316
as of this point, is it's he hasn't really gone to Europe that much.

671
01:16:42,035 --> 01:16:51,159
At this point in the Ducktales adventures. It's it's in these first few stories he's gonna start Scrooge stories. He's gonna start exploring that a little bit more.

672
01:16:51,918 --> 01:17:00,710
But yeah, it till, like, castle secret and danger to skies. And then for a long time that was not really much in Europe, which which I find interesting.

673
01:17:01,347 --> 01:17:06,785
So you guys... Let's talk a little bit about other, like, references and adaptations.

674
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:09,239
We had alluded to this being

675
01:17:09,895 --> 01:17:13,107
used as one of the episodes of duck

676
01:17:13,939 --> 01:17:18,199
I think did did we all rewatch the episode? Yeah. I worked with yesterday.

677
01:17:18,819 --> 01:17:23,591
I see but before what recording. Yeah. I got to... Rewatch it this morning.

678
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:43,075
And and I have been revisiting at least some brief scenes of some of these episodes as they have corresponding ones for the stories. Like, I watched a little bit of back to the lawn. I can I watched some of the for t la? And I not this episode is actually pretty strong compared to those.

679
01:17:43,674 --> 01:17:46,946
I don't I don't know what you guys think, but it's called... It's called Scrooge

680
01:17:47,465 --> 01:17:57,283
pet So, you know, he they change it a little bit. But but they change it in a way that actually Barks for me rather than just doing a straight up Al expectation.

681
01:17:57,821 --> 01:18:19,414
The kids wanna get screwed to pat. And as mentioned, it ends up being kind of a list full reminder of glittering gold because that's the statute that the lock goes on. And he's relieved when it doesn't shatter. So I I liked it. I don't always love the the original app so the way that I did as a kid, but I found that one really enjoyable.

682
01:18:19,894 --> 01:18:48,259
What do you think Ruben? Well, it's a pretty good episode, and it's a pretty good rotation of the story it's not accurate because the change some bits. Moved back and forth. Of course, we use large pad and credit instead of donald. And it's Al complete link different character. But I think it's a decent since Episode. And also I like the idea how to introduce the in another way because they're still at the harbor when they are introduced to the learning, but let's they have like

683
01:18:48,639 --> 01:18:52,954
a different motivation of it. And I I will say it's better. Because it isn't

684
01:18:53,454 --> 01:18:57,114
Al lot the our Barks. But it it's pretty good. Let's say

685
01:18:57,534 --> 01:19:07,881
the alive is so that's pretty much can't I'd say Al least the story wise is pretty much the story for them to start from dot. But this it's more

686
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:15,093
adaptation. The pull it in another way. What did you think we miguel? Oh, as a ruben said they he still not way to

687
01:19:15,433 --> 01:19:35,793
introduce the lending and it just don't send me that that's pretty similar to hold the priority and the pixel lite Barks was introduced. They can't yeah kinda use that one for lam. That's done. That's honestly, I I found the introduction of the lam more believable in the cartoon. I... I'm not saying it's better. But I did find it more believable.

688
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:40,739
It definitely did not treat Norway as respectfully as a Barks.

689
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:42,613
No way.

690
01:19:42,951 --> 01:19:44,970
Pretty pretty silly stereo

691
01:19:45,349 --> 01:19:55,819
of, yes. They call it no way instead of Norway, which makes for a couple of silly yeah. And all the people run their own. They run around and leather the ro and and... Yeah. And they speak very

692
01:19:56,559 --> 01:20:18,641
where the we're reaching us kinda made think about the x files episode where better or in Norway. Yeah. I haven't seen that one myself. I know you guys talked about... But apparently a pretty cri version. Yeah. That's and also, I know the because they're like. Because I remember it's more being a German accent probably because a wearing leather.

693
01:20:18,979 --> 01:20:24,724
And again, the architecture is like his mickey town, so switzerland meets switzerland lamp.

694
01:20:26,174 --> 01:20:27,072
I'll tell you.

695
01:20:27,807 --> 01:20:29,542
Go ahead. No. I just wanna say that.

696
01:20:29,959 --> 01:20:32,389
But if they're more pulling it than like this,

697
01:20:33,044 --> 01:20:36,624
swedish chef type of talking. So Yeah. It is like

698
01:20:37,204 --> 01:20:40,199
I see that this swedish is Jeff already where started this

699
01:20:41,298 --> 01:20:44,915
probably for whatever I know it didn't start it. But it's like this. That's what...

700
01:20:45,773 --> 01:20:47,152
It's like this cultural

701
01:20:47,731 --> 01:20:49,569
agreement and how the scanner made stock.

702
01:20:50,383 --> 01:20:52,878
But, of course, I'm not talking about since they're just talking

703
01:20:53,216 --> 01:20:55,831
words within in that in that type of...

704
01:20:56,928 --> 01:20:58,639
Yeah. They're they're pulling up pulling the

705
01:21:00,295 --> 01:21:09,308
around see. Yeah. And they're doing like the the try to, like, because I've heard that the norwegian of canadians, it's sounds like we're singing when we're

706
01:21:09,765 --> 01:21:18,196
talking, and that's probably what we're trying takes. Yeah. On the hold, though, it's a pretty successful at episode as far as the handful of Barks

707
01:21:18,835 --> 01:21:19,474
Ducktales

708
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:28,704
that they did. I think it might be one of the best. Yeah. I'll have to think about that. Think the land beneath the ground optic adaptation might be my favorite of them. But...

709
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:31,284
Yeah. The one pretty solid. Let's see.

710
01:21:32,418 --> 01:21:40,030
I'm not aware of any other major sql that any other Comics creators did to this. I think Rosa might have snuck a Cameo

711
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:49,118
in his like, Olympic story, there was, like, a little lemon cameo or something in that one, but but just an off hand thing.

712
01:21:50,688 --> 01:22:05,544
Yeah. Let's see. And you guys any any other thoughts anything else you wanted to highlight before we transition to favorite panels and and wrap things up. Yeah. I would just like to mention that the period when Barks was making lending documents

713
01:22:05,924 --> 01:22:08,524
Since he wanted to visualize this a billion of something.

714
01:22:09,379 --> 01:22:24,154
That would end up giving in... Giving him quite a headache. He wife Gary Williams and sometimes to get married in July. And they're have to go on six week holiday. And when the day for leaving was approaching guys still missed much a bunch of linking.

715
01:22:24,634 --> 01:22:32,641
Especially on le So this become kind of a joke about among their friends and neighbors. Would I get to start finished before they went on their holiday?

716
01:22:33,041 --> 01:22:34,699
So Get told

717
01:22:35,174 --> 01:22:38,071
story roughly like this. When we finally have finished

718
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:39,509
that dun

719
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:40,388
lending

720
01:22:40,807 --> 01:22:48,840
story. We just showed it Hooray and one of the neighbors come running and ask if you had finished and be answered Yes. We are done.

721
01:22:49,517 --> 01:22:50,017
So

722
01:22:50,394 --> 01:22:57,059
rest out with this getting the story done and in know... In a sense you can perhaps feel this urgency

723
01:22:57,438 --> 01:23:03,267
for Barks to get done with the story that it kinda got himself in stick bid. He had to draw his.

724
01:23:03,966 --> 01:23:11,753
Yeah. Thanks for sharing that. That's a a dynamic to. I think I saw that a long time ago, and I didn't encounter it in in we

725
01:23:12,091 --> 01:23:20,766
reading and researching for this episode Barks off and he you gotta imagine that he off has this thought of, like, why did I make him so rich

726
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:41,204
and he's he's always kind of exploring ways to draw few of the actual coins in those bin scenes, but make it look as convincing as possible. Because he really does. He sets himself up sometimes for drawing all these millions of coins and bottle caps and le and jewels

727
01:23:41,543 --> 01:23:48,448
sometimes. So... Yeah. That's that's funny thing to think about. Any any other thoughts have just one little more story that

728
01:23:49,026 --> 01:24:03,634
in the eight region eighty character and a friend, he sent a letter Barks were told him all good this norwegian story was, and they wondered if he... They received Norway. Something Barks sadly haven't. So The same is... I

729
01:24:04,453 --> 01:24:06,953
with mail and when it arrived

730
01:24:07,413 --> 01:24:08,609
Barks place, it was

731
01:24:09,387 --> 01:24:28,919
on the soft it was apparently tasty and there was... Is there that they sent them? They go both. Yeah. The goat jeez. But there was a picture. There was a picture of a rain there on the package. So Bark thought it was rain cheese. And I don't think you learned into until many years later that there is no such thing as rain.

732
01:24:29,459 --> 01:24:42,874
That's funny. I mean, they're mammals so you you can milk them. So some... Someone must have made it at some point, but clearly, it's not something that's like in wide beige. Right? It's probably gonna be some person in the chrome that tell them.

733
01:24:43,728 --> 01:24:51,300
Oh, there is right cheese sprite. Right. Awesome. Well you guys... We we definitely covered a lot of the great panels.

734
01:24:51,774 --> 01:24:54,274
In this story. There are some really wonderful

735
01:24:54,614 --> 01:24:55,454
splash panels.

736
01:24:56,014 --> 01:25:24,009
Are there any any that you'd like to kinda go back two or other panels that you'd like to highlight as a favorite or notable panel? Yeah. I just wanna tell that it's this... It's kinda interesting to see the panel where the download and nephews are actually packing for the visit. Because and that's kinda like some behind the scenes for me, it's like it's behind the scenes type of thing. But we don't see enough that they're actually pack packing. It's like Severino one of the Inducks going to the toilet that we never see.

737
01:25:25,049 --> 01:25:28,354
So and I'm not sure if I actually would see that, but

738
01:25:29,448 --> 01:25:33,608
method like one of the things Severino see, and I love seeing it. I can't look it sometimes. Yeah.

739
01:25:34,605 --> 01:25:40,604
Adds to the the storytelling. It should be done rough actually Also I love the sequence where

740
01:25:41,593 --> 01:25:44,844
they're running after landing on the boat or the ship. And

741
01:25:45,182 --> 01:26:02,690
the learning is running not top and Arp. And is climbing after it, and it's climbing on the front of the arp and the landing just jumps off an up the leader that suits the Barks with donald on. And I think that's great comedy actually. And also it is it feels like.

742
01:26:03,189 --> 01:26:03,689
Like

743
01:26:04,987 --> 01:26:08,696
probably something you would like to see. You would likely see in

744
01:26:09,033 --> 01:26:15,395
on the cartoons, but also thank you to work here. And also, Scrooge notices is the that was shooting into the...

745
01:26:16,052 --> 01:26:17,963
This sky and is looking at an

746
01:26:19,575 --> 01:26:20,075
saying,

747
01:26:20,413 --> 01:26:26,114
it was looking at the angle, and it says there go trying to get out of his share of the work.

748
01:26:26,847 --> 01:26:41,284
Yeah. I think that's a great punch line as well. That is a great line. Yeah. You're right. Good. Good call on that one. How about come? Well, there is two parts there would like to mention, and the first one is the the fourth panel on page one. We're on the.

749
01:26:41,978 --> 01:26:45,807
And the only way to open the door is by working the combination of seven locks.

750
01:26:46,764 --> 01:26:51,751
I just low expression here and that that panel was also used as this

751
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:59,199
picture you could buy, which was signed by Barks. If I remember correctly, they made like not a little graph, but something similar

752
01:26:59,739 --> 01:27:22,219
collectible. Neat The other part like is when Scrooge just trying to corner the landing up in the rigging. It's It's a silver little part of it. But I just think it's nicely drawn and also light our sutra has cut on this green gloves and then I think is gonna fix the landing this time but then it gets this. Yeah. It's definitely a fun sequence. I I

753
01:27:22,677 --> 01:27:31,290
criticized being a little Gladstone, but it is fun. Yeah, Ruben. I also just quickly want to add I every time the learning is biting. One of.

754
01:27:31,828 --> 01:27:33,525
Yeah. I think it's hilarious and it's

755
01:27:34,078 --> 01:27:38,863
correctly wrong and Also also like to see the village of Ducktales

756
01:27:39,023 --> 01:27:40,440
from distance, I'd say.

757
01:27:40,778 --> 01:27:47,480
Yeah. Because it's we we can see the mountains and the norwegian village looks accurate. And looks cozy.

758
01:27:48,179 --> 01:28:10,374
And it looks like I loves saying there's village surrounded by the mountains And embassy. Yeah. It's a great scene. It does look very appealing. I'll just mention too, I really like the panel where they present the le Scrooge at first. And he just screens. A ran a horrible money chewing rat that that cracks me up along with his expression. And then from

759
01:28:10,768 --> 01:28:12,427
reminds me of that in the

760
01:28:12,765 --> 01:28:16,980
the story where it's Al about rats being in the bin that's

761
01:28:17,813 --> 01:28:18,512
the last

762
01:28:18,929 --> 01:28:22,739
before it tells Scrooge, she has to mail this pillow Right. To the

763
01:28:23,436 --> 01:28:31,375
work over screw chair. Scrooge prescription one thing. What you I doing? Oh you'll you'll see it because I just had to tell you that are red the bin.

764
01:28:31,714 --> 01:28:40,352
Yeah. Makeup. I just realized that the openings dashboard also can seen as a symbol way of Scrooge looking himself. I talked london. Right.

765
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:45,694
Yeah. And we can absolutely literally. It's the last time he's gonna see the money that's in there.

766
01:28:46,428 --> 01:28:58,638
For many many weeks, which... Let's see. What does that remind me? You should take that... Yeah. I think it's in the mini mystery. When Yeah. You yeah. Taking a buzz the last you'll see his money.

767
01:28:59,317 --> 01:29:14,903
The other panel that I really liked was just that one that I've mentioned where he's laying on the wall, kind of four lonely picking at them. And he's he's all but given up. That's a Yeah. It's a great one. Alright. Well, you guys I think we did this story some real justice.

768
01:29:15,923 --> 01:29:16,663
But I

769
01:29:17,003 --> 01:29:22,438
