4
00:00:54,282 --> 00:01:03,247
and I love talking about them with the long time friends and and new friends that I've met in the course of doing this podcast. And I'm delighted

5
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,256
to have a couple of my returning guest hosts

6
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:08,734
to discuss

7
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:09,573
today's

8
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:12,171
story, which is the secret of Honda,

9
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:13,984
or Hon.

10
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:17,539
I guess, I guess we can we can discuss that. But

11
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:18,857
let me

12
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:19,696
introduce

13
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:23,906
my guest are Warren Harmon and Sarah, Santiago.

14
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:37,729
Warren, I think I think you've just done some some traveling in the area. When introduced yourself and tell us about that? Yeah. Mark, hey, Sarah. Yeah. I've just got back from a three week adventure to Par peru and

15
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:38,545
Ecuador.

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,460
And

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:53,195
the Islands, the Amazon Rainforest, and probably one of my most memorable times was much picchu to up in Andy Mountains that couldn't help but channel donald and the nephews from lost in The Andy. So I was

18
00:01:53,575 --> 00:02:01,401
have a having a lot of fun there. Lots of great photos lots of great memories and you got some great Barks locations in

19
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:04,115
that there. I did. I was

20
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:12,005
happy to share it with the Barks community, the fan community and had a couple of figurines that I I post in some great locations,

21
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:20,774
especially the the sacred Valley in my two picchu. It was was a lot of fun. That's that's really cute. I'm glad to talk about this story since I just returned. Excellent.

22
00:02:21,593 --> 00:02:24,150
And sarah, what do you think? Are we talking about.

23
00:02:26,997 --> 00:02:33,689
So I read it in... Like, in an American English accent first, and I thought it was him Honda.

24
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:37,065
And then I thought about it and decided to go with

25
00:02:38,704 --> 00:02:55,870
Because the rules in Spanish, if it ends in an o or an a or an n, the syllable that is stressed is the one before the last And... And of course, going by the proper Spanish rules, we we'd have to O omit h and go on, I guess. But no.

26
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,603
On Nor eureka. Yes. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. And.

27
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:08,735
It seemed to also be a evo, not just Doris but Costa rica. Right. I think that's right. It's one of Barks fun a ama names.

28
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:18,701
On du and costa to Rica. And just as a refresher, you guys have been on together frequently. Warren, you are my long time

29
00:03:19,094 --> 00:03:24,263
Barks fan and collector, and Sarah, I have you on to give kind of a newbie

30
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,275
perspective because you haven't read these stories.

31
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,970
Before. So okay. I, of course, I'm a long time fan. And and this this story, the secret of,

32
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:51,033
It is one that I I didn't really read that much. You know? And in fact, it has all these elements where in my mind when I thought back on it. I I I feel like I kinda mis mismatched it with a bunch of other Barks stories

33
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:57,115
I kinda have trouble separating it from, like, moments from oh from the gil man

34
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:58,315
or

35
00:03:58,695 --> 00:03:59,195
maybe

36
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:00,035
from

37
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:01,595
the pixelated

38
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:02,689
pair,

39
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:07,563
what else, a couple of the stories that take place in the African jungle

40
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:08,442
So

41
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,251
right off the bat, feel like this is not necessarily the most memorable

42
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,060
of of Bark adventure stories. It also it has some

43
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,531
I I think you guys this one has some problems.

44
00:04:22,188 --> 00:04:24,941
To it in in a few in a few respects.

45
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:28,606
Yeah. I agree, Mark. I I think I think this one...

46
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,637
Barks was not at the top of this form here.

47
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:50,645
Also I don't think he his research... Well, I I'm not gonna blame on research. I'm just gonna blame on ignorance and and just of his choices of language. But... But again, given the times and this time in his life, I mean, he's fifty six years old. He's got ten years before he stops drawing for the comics and to begin his other career.

48
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:58,724
I I just these just it it... It's less of a story that I wanted to be. Yeah. What what do you think? What are your kind of initial thoughts Sarah?

49
00:04:59,402 --> 00:05:00,181
Well, I

50
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:02,134
came up with a drinking game.

51
00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:12,245
Yeah. So I used to do a podcast called educating key where we would introduce each other. Very much like you do, mark. To me.

52
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:13,244
Two

53
00:05:13,782 --> 00:05:15,401
franchises shows, comics,

54
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:24,196
books, movies that we love, but somebody else has not seen. And we came up with drinking game rules for everything.

55
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:39,365
That we talked about and mine was take a drink every time there's a word or concept that's totally degrading to indigenous people. But you have to do it with, like, the lowest alcohol content beer

56
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:44,049
or you will just be wasted and, like, need to go to the hospital

57
00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:45,248
Right.

58
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:48,241
Right. It's is has to be for alcohol point.

59
00:05:49,537 --> 00:06:01,619
And and, you know, the... You're absolutely right. This one is This one is pretty insensitive. That the thing is the the thing that frustrate me. Right? We... We've had these conversations about some of these

60
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,259
challenging moments

61
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:14,647
before stuff that has aged very poorly stuff that is sensitive I always go out of my way to, like, observe that, yes. This was very common. These were very common depictions

62
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:18,372
at the time, you would see this sort of stuff in comics

63
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:22,242
and and in other elements of pop culture, obviously,

64
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:45,884
on the other hand, there there are people who got it and closer to right even back then. But for me, you guys the really frustrating thing is we we we don't get like the flip side of it at least being a really good story with these, like, really unfortunate elements Right? Like looking back at a story like Voodoo Do? It has these awful stereotypes

65
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:47,997
and and really

66
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:52,240
poorly age depictions, but it's like it's a thrilling

67
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:54,054
dread Inducks

68
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:55,331
adventure.

69
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:01,430
Like it's really engaging. I I mean, say what you will about the insensitive moments.

70
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:23,195
It's it's just a great yarn, and maybe a better comparison might be the guild man. Right? Because, like, the guild man is... I I think you could probably argue warren that this this is kind of like a soft remake of the guild man because it kinda shares some elements And a golden man has some of this same, like savage native tropes,

71
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:38,129
but I I it's not quite as bad and it's also, like in the service of a really engaging really siding adventure. Yeah. I I I read a that did compare it a bit to the gil man and and other

72
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:56,318
depictions of other characters in the story to other more classic stories. But, yeah. This one, I I just had had a problem very much like you did mark that that not only is the the language and sensitive in many parts and the thoughts and the agreeing by the Nephews and Donald and and sort of carrying forward

73
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:58,047
that that depiction

74
00:07:58,464 --> 00:07:58,964
negative

75
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:18,188
stereotype type. It just wasn't wasn't a classic story. It's it's he's, you know, you mentioned pixelated parent. You mentioned, and I I I mentioned earlier when we when we were just kind planning to show that that there were, you know, other, like, trail of the unicorn and and others that have native indigenous

76
00:08:18,605 --> 00:08:23,034
depictions like of the north with the the es, you know, tribes.

77
00:08:23,694 --> 00:08:35,156
And yet, that they seem to redeem themselves a little bit and it was light and, we kinda forgave that, but one, I don't know. I have a a tough time. Yeah. I I think... So so all of us

78
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:53,662
we're we're kind of on the same page. Which means I definitely wanna go out of my way to find the things that I do like about this one because there there are a lot of great things about it. A media mediocre bark story is still, you know, the the reason for this podcast is that he's he's a super superior

79
00:08:54,001 --> 00:09:04,588
ko creator. So there there's a lot of brilliant stuff in here. It's just on the whole, I don't find this to be the strongest Barks story, and it's not just because of the, like,

80
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:06,366
Savage,

81
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:07,325
poorly,

82
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:13,650
native stuff. Like. That definitely pulls it down further. But right. Alright. So a little bit of background

83
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:15,226
before we go into it.

84
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,998
This one is one of our relatively

85
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:20,236
rare

86
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:22,167
donald dot comic

87
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:27,455
stories. There are not a lot of them that we cover that have appeared in the Donald Inducks line of Comics.

88
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:51,651
I think the last one was Triple treat. Mh. And this one appeared in donald dot number forty six. It was published in March of fifty six. And warren I saw that he created it back in September of fifty four, which seems like an unusually long gap he couldn't I I didn't Google around too much, but I couldn't figure out a reason for that unusual

89
00:09:52,746 --> 00:10:08,511
delay. Maybe some listener can fill me in if anyone knows about that. I was unaware of that. That... That's interesting. Perhaps the editors hung on to it and wanted to find a a vehicle for it. And and it's interesting as a as a collector of the adventure stories and the four color stories, which is what I primary...

90
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:31,240
Primarily collect. I didn't really get into the donald dot com. So I discovered this and that ten volume hard cover ct Al, the Carl Barks library where I'm I'm reading it in black and white. I do have the glad edition, but I couldn't find it I I searched for this one. So it probably doesn't have as many reprint. So would that be a fair statement? Yeah. It's got kind of a low average number. This one's got

91
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:32,477
ten printing

92
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:42,864
including the original. I actually do happen to have the very original dow printing which is unusual for me because like it would have... It would been my third

93
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:49,229
instance of owning the story because I had the, like, album version that was collected with the guild man,

94
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:51,220
and the the really nice

95
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,079
nicely drawn covered by Don Rosa.

96
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:09,170
For donald duck adventure number twenty one. I really do like that. That cover. And so, yeah. I don't I can't can't remember why as was a, like, thirteen year old I went out in my way. It was probably a a pretty pricey Barks issue for me to try to own.

97
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,745
Let's see. This is a twenty four pager, which

98
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:48,194
is shorter than his long adventure stories, but is about about the average length going forward for a lot of his adventures I guess it's worth noting that we're like, we're kind of outside now that period that fans generally consider Barks golden age quote on unquote. Most people would say that kinda went to how do you think warren roughly, like nineteen fifty three, maybe fifty four or So... In terms of when when he kinda started departing from that Golden era? Yeah. Went and it. I No. I would would definitely classify as golden era as that forty eight forty nine

99
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:49,875
two fifty three.

100
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:57,436
He's he's I think he's either reaching for story ideas that he's perhaps explored before and trying different angles.

101
00:11:58,212 --> 00:12:08,389
Looking at how these characters can evolve and maybe they don't need to evolve. I don't know. And and and we'll comment on it later, but the artwork work here, the character drawings Barks

102
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:20,815
sub par in my opinion, and we can talk about a few panels when we get there. Sure. Yeah. I mean, that's not to say he doesn't still have brilliant stories in him because there gonna be some all time classics

103
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:22,015
coming up.

104
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:32,082
But but I feel like his his most memorable stories starting now are gonna be... The ones where he... He went a little bit out there. You know, I just put out the issue for

105
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:33,971
for the gold and flee,

106
00:12:34,348 --> 00:12:43,000
which I think has its problems, but you can't deny that it's like just a wildly invent Yeah and super memorable

107
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:53,135
story. Yeah. Whereas, like, I'm just hard pressed to remember this one. So I don't really have a lot of other Barks round aside from what we already talked about how we've got a fun

108
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:56,455
Sarah, what's the term? I'm trying to remember

109
00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:00,344
oh, a Port tow. Right? That's what Hon

110
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:14,425
Would be call a port where you smash two words together like that. I'm visualizing this being in I think they that they do points vaguely to that Central America

111
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:32,689
near like Panama Costa Rica. So I think that's where we're gonna be in this. Yeah. So before before we plan into the story itself, We do have a couple of titles from around the world. And guys we don't need to dwell on this one too long because most of these titles are a pretty straightforward

112
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:35,520
translation of the English title.

113
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:41,221
But it's fun to mention some of the local equivalent. Right? Since we take place

114
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:42,393
in Central

115
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,307
South Ish America.

116
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:52,798
Sarah, do you wanna share with us the Spanish and and Mexico title? Yeah. For once they were the same, they're not always the same. Correct??

117
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,035
That's right. This one is Al.

118
00:13:58,311 --> 00:13:59,430
I've messed up myself.

119
00:13:59,844 --> 00:14:01,541
And messed up my own rules.

120
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:08,545
It's it's not the kind of word shape you would really get that often in Spanish.

121
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:14,253
It's not. I I think that... I'm I did apply on Eureka

122
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:19,105
rules to it. But I could also easily see that there being an accent

123
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:21,264
to intentionally change

124
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:36,053
the stress. Right. Yeah. So it's just that straightforward secret of. What about you weren't? I think I gave you another local. Yeah. I think it gave me Brazil, which courses is Portuguese and and the translation that I have is

125
00:14:38,147 --> 00:14:39,019
So it's very

126
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,220
so similar

127
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:54,229
and not a stretch from the actual title. Right. And then the only one that kinda stood out to me as interesting is the the French one, which seems like it's really trying to sell the story you guys. It's called let

128
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:58,438
The amazing

129
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:00,332
Expedition.

130
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:09,559
So that said, let's let's do this. Let's plow into the story. Alright. So the secret of

131
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:19,173
Opens up and warren... And right away I'm kinda reminded of the opening of the guild man. Right? We've got we've got Donald and

132
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,750
his nephews approaching Scrooge,

133
00:15:22,164 --> 00:15:24,716
hot hands kinda interestingly. Mh.

134
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:27,131
Looking very respectful.

135
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:34,205
And and screws is indicating to a map of central and south America. Kinda like Donald

136
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:52,685
standing in front of that map at the beginning of the guild man. It's first. Yeah. Yeah. And and, you know, this is some effective signaling about the story. It's a good way to set up the plot. Scrooge is explaining to the the dot it has a job for them that will take them down the to tropical.

137
00:15:53,822 --> 00:16:04,046
And and he goes on to a explain that he's lost a mail plane that crashed at a spot marked x on the map and there to go and recover some valuable

138
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:04,926
papers.

139
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,255
So right right off the bat, it doesn't feel like this is the most

140
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:12,890
inspired treasure or not. Right? We're after, like, deeds

141
00:16:13,365 --> 00:16:13,865
papers,

142
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:14,745
documents,

143
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:18,464
they may be important, but they're not like it's it's not

144
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:23,558
the gil man and the the Magenta stamp. It's not

145
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:30,511
square eggs in play awful. It is. It's not it's not that exciting. It's. Basically

146
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:46,984
it's it's it's Scrooge just business portfolio. You know, It it that it was on this plane for whatever reason, and it's not a rare, unique treasure And... But he seems to be pretty Al, and this is, you know, with screw. Jeez he's they're happy throughout this entire

147
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:48,541
first page

148
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:52,735
until, of course, we see the first

149
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:57,833
a mention of, you know, who the is yeah. Yeah. So...

150
00:16:58,231 --> 00:16:58,630
Unfortunate.

151
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:04,609
On the first page, it almost feels like It's it's... On the first couple of pages, there are

152
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:05,687
uncomfortable

153
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:07,842
number of mentions

154
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:11,969
of words like un eyes and savages.

155
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:13,607
Almost like

156
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:24,391
like, he's just going out of his way. To use these terms more than you might have to. You know, the the dots are immediately like questioning him. That is the un civilized Barks

157
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:26,969
that you're pointing at. And and they're

158
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:45,096
they're commenting that they're worried about this. And it goes on to the next page where Scrooge is trying to convince them that the indians of the area are quote as peaceful as kittens. But then the Nephews chime in, and I think you mentioned this warren and they're weirdly agreeable

159
00:17:45,473 --> 00:17:46,491
about the the

160
00:17:46,828 --> 00:17:47,328
characterization

161
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:56,755
Yeah. There's that you Sarah? They're not defending the ind folks. They're not there they're they're they're actually agreeing and saying that even read about them in school, which is

162
00:17:57,335 --> 00:17:58,975
I don't know. You know? Right.

163
00:17:59,615 --> 00:18:07,290
And and I guess I had the thought that, like, Barks is very flexible with Donald Right? He needs him to be an every man character,

164
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:15,622
he's also very flexible with the, like, the local peoples in these stories. Because sometimes he wants them to be a little more sophisticated,

165
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:22,670
more less objection. And then sometimes they he just needs the savage trail. Yeah. So,

166
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,630
Sarah, do you mind telling us how

167
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:26,610
Scrooge

168
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:32,814
does end up convincing the He offers them a reward of five thousand dollars.

169
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:42,979
So if you tack on a a zero for inflation from the fifties today. That's about fifty thousand dollars. Yeah. That bad. Doesn't it seem un

170
00:18:43,396 --> 00:19:00,483
for screws to offer that much money to his nephews when he's been able to get them to go for far less to far more regions stuff the world. Yeah. It's not the most consistent. But and then he he get... He gets a little extra neat into to Donald. Right. By.

171
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:08,244
Taking advantage of Donald Jealous is glad stone to spur competition. Right. And

172
00:19:08,623 --> 00:19:21,575
and he does it. He just says I imagine cousin Glad gander or would jump at the chance to win this five thousand dollar reward. This feels kinda like dashed off. It's it's not it's not the most developed men

173
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:36,251
way of bringing Gladstone stone into the story, I feel like. I mean, why not just offer it to Gladstone in the first place? Yeah. Yeah. That's true. There's no Probably do it for cheaper because Gladstone luck would have helped them along the way. Right.

174
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:40,332
Yeah. I guess there's the argument that, you know, Gladstone

175
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:43,361
luck. He... Maybe he just doesn't wanna mess with that. Mh.

176
00:19:44,756 --> 00:19:46,747
But So so Warren,

177
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:54,922
how does Scrooge kinda set them off on the job? Well, it actually pulls out a map that the injured pilot from the plane that crashed

178
00:19:55,515 --> 00:20:03,668
apparently, they're sent or he drew it, but got it to uncle Scrooge. So that he could show him a map of the location

179
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:09,515
and donald in the nephews now are kind of looking at that in it's sixty miles

180
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:15,915
of long hiking, which I'm very. I I get three miles of very long hiking in the Gala silence.

181
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:32,499
So I can imagine the terrain that they're talking six team miles of jungle hiking. It sounds like it could take... It could take weeks. It would it should take weeks. Let me tell you. And and they ponder the fact that with the kind of reward money they're looking at,

182
00:20:32,838 --> 00:20:49,541
they could hire a helicopter and Yeah. And immediately screwed shuts them down. Right? He he tells them this is where where it his face kind of breaks and shows a little bit of nervous nest. And this is the big, like, I guess this is the secret

183
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:50,597
of.

184
00:20:51,929 --> 00:21:04,151
We're gonna be set up for this, like, native super superstition But as of now, all we know is that there are things that the natives are super stitch about and it's gonna be safe for the walk And so we kinda

185
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,888
transition to the part where Gladstone

186
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:11,595
comes into the story and the docks are like talking about the full

187
00:21:12,211 --> 00:21:18,950
story. I'm not gonna keep saying savages. The Ducktales keep saying it. I'll just... I'll call them native.

188
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:29,720
Cure on out. I've been calling the locals Sure. Locals. Yeah. That's that things like the best... Right. Because even native definitely has, like, the feel of...

189
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:36,540
It's it's a very loaded word as you say. So yeah. So, you know, they they eventually Scrooge

190
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,615
indicates that yes, the natives get particularly

191
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:43,355
mad about flying machines. We'll learn more about that later.

192
00:21:43,995 --> 00:22:06,604
And and the docks The Ducktales are like kind of... They're doing in their good luck. They can't believe how lucky they've been. You guys this sounds like a a tremendous amount of work for me. I it never felt to me like, it's got an adequate payday at the end. But honestly, like, people die in those jungles. This this always rang a little bit false to me.

193
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:14,492
But of course, the mention of how lucky they are is is gonna be set up. Right? Sarah? Well, right. Because then

194
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:18,480
glad stones look benefits him and he happens upon them.

195
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:33,370
Kind of just is their thinking like, no. There's bound to be a joker in the deal someplace. Like, they're like, this is too good to be true. And then, of course, Gladstone shows up. Right. So we get kind of the predictable we're glad stone

196
00:22:33,828 --> 00:22:37,358
sussex out immediately that they've got this map and

197
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:48,515
he's thinking to himself. This is a a chance to show them up that with his luck, he can figure out how to get whatever a kind of treasure they're looking They're looking for.

198
00:22:49,472 --> 00:22:55,288
And the Ducktales really should know better. I feel like. But they kinda talk themselves into

199
00:22:56,461 --> 00:22:57,519
trying to

200
00:22:57,856 --> 00:22:59,073
best glad.

201
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:06,388
Do you wanna tell us one about what their their strategy is Yeah. They're... Well, first of all, the the treasure map

202
00:23:06,806 --> 00:23:12,226
is is quite revealing and the Barks glad got his eyes on on some treasure. But

203
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:18,184
now that the map is sort of out there and they're aware of it, the best way to outlet

204
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:44,849
Glad stone is to memorize the map. So he'll never get his hands on it and eventually, just destroy the map. So they study the map for as it says here for many minutes, Every river and Valley and mountain must be sharp on our minds they say. So I... And they all do a good job of that. And then, of course, he rips it up into very tiny pieces and throws it over the bridge. Into the river. Okay. So this is where I start to

205
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:49,312
anticipate like I I'm like, okay. I've fried enough of these I know it's gonna happen.

206
00:23:49,790 --> 00:24:04,148
Something always goes wrong. A problem always comes up that the kids then have to solve because Donald just is too emotional to do it, but my prediction was completely off. Right? Like, I thought he was setting them up for

207
00:24:04,605 --> 00:24:06,075
forgetting. Like... Right? Like

208
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:07,353
not

209
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:22,480
understanding the map as well as they thought they would. And then Glad stone somehow would have found the map and rest keep them. That it doesn't happen that way. I could... I could definitely see that. That does seem like a a kind of templates.

210
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:29,995
Response to it. So, yeah, I think that's totally... I like that you're kind of getting yourself into that Barks mindset there.

211
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,806
But, of course, it is another bark trope that glad

212
00:24:35,185 --> 00:24:51,680
lock is just gonna intervene And you guys this is kind of fun. Right What happens is that Gladstone goes down to kind of ponder things and the, like, little eddie, the little whirlpool pool of water. Ends up arranging these pieces for him.

213
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,640
It's it's not the most invent

214
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,015
depiction of the gander lock

215
00:24:57,992 --> 00:25:01,762
And it's kinda of fun. It reminds me of the imp

216
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:08,197
drive in hitch crackers guidance here. Right. If it didn't feel like look so much is.

217
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:13,044
Right. Because because it's just over the top, how unlikely that would be.

218
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:16,115
So So glad.

219
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:32,664
Like... How it's gonna say, I was just gonna say Barks and Sarah, that not only is this highly highly improbable look but not only does the the the pieces of the map actually re assemble into the map, but right under glad stones b at the.

220
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:39,847
I think come on. I I I had a a tough time buying that. But again, this is an extraordinarily lucky duct and

221
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,736
and Gladstone dead

222
00:25:42,232 --> 00:25:51,865
of that. And he doesn't... I've never thought of him as a lucky duck. I've never thought of him as a lucky duck. Like like... Well, he technically a gander. Right? Yeah. That's true.

223
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,005
That's But that's like

224
00:25:54,425 --> 00:25:56,099
lucky stuff. It's an

225
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:57,296
right right

226
00:25:57,954 --> 00:26:04,020
you want that's that might well have been how Barks came up with the the game for sure. That's adorable.

227
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:06,273
Thanks for helping me make that connection warrant.

228
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:22,084
I didn't mean to, but you're very welcome. And and should be noted that Gladstone doesn't have the time really to study yet. But but again, his crash is locked... His luck is his crutch. I'm the next sequence, it's it's kind neat It's basically

229
00:26:22,463 --> 00:26:24,002
all about the nephews

230
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,117
trying to get there as quickly as humanly

231
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:28,956
possible.

232
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,847
And so we see all these modes of

233
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:33,764
transportation, like really...

234
00:26:34,223 --> 00:26:36,975
That they're racing on this, the fastest

235
00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:37,855
steam,

236
00:26:38,795 --> 00:26:45,186
a banana train headed for the interior, and there's a reference to Donald giving the engineer eighty

237
00:26:45,962 --> 00:26:47,698
to break the speed record.

238
00:26:50,229 --> 00:26:51,447
Sarah, what's the

239
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:55,432
strategy for the for getting the most out of the donkey keeps.

240
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:56,651
They

241
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,688
suspend a mad bumblebee

242
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:00,345
behind each donkey.

243
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,776
I love the artwork and that.

244
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,732
I love that that

245
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,249
there's nothing

246
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:16,606
that Barks tells us about how donald caught the has been storing and transporting the b. He just somehow has a little cage with a little b.

247
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:20,016
And ties it to Al little doll too. Yeah.

248
00:27:21,494 --> 00:27:31,855
One, I like the art here a lot, but but it's specifically the background art, because as you note, some of some of the figure are is maybe not his strong.

249
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:53,172
I'm glad you brought that up. I'm I'm actually quite disappointed in the depiction of Gladstone and even though even donald that the nephews look almost like they used to, but I I see these rounder figures and shorter beak, I know that that glass speak shortened from forty nine to to fifty four, but I it it just looks like he drew these more quickly.

250
00:27:53,749 --> 00:28:20,425
But, yes, I can't and I could go on about little little things, but I think the background art here, starting with that Al wonderful shot of donald and the boys on the steam and then that shot of the steam and the trains and this huge sort of semi splash panel with the bridge. That's just classic Barks in the hip. Putting the condo in there with the question mark is a nice little bag is. And that condo is a bird of Northern South America.

251
00:28:21,002 --> 00:28:24,453
And did you see any? Oh, we did. We saw one one condo

252
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:42,038
fly over the Amazon rainforest. And it was quite fascinating. It was... Our guides were telling us their look at these cause over here, look at these parents over here look Al and four different species of monkeys. It was incredible. But anyway, I especially love and and condo. We have...

253
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:43,876
Yeah. We have the Us

254
00:28:44,229 --> 00:28:44,729
baby

255
00:28:45,107 --> 00:28:53,841
here in Pitt pittsburgh. Okay. And they have a couple of condo. And I always love to look at them. Brenda, my wife and I did see an Andy and Pandora in captivity

256
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:59,966
in Cusco up in the Indian mountains that was quite amazing. So we did see one up close. Nice.

257
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:07,300
So there something else. Yeah. And like you say, this is a really cool splash panel. I like this sequence

258
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:14,785
of them kind of racing Al mail but it also, like, it kinda soften the impact of how dangerous

259
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:30,655
this journey could be because he's just playing it for gag here. Right? He's only playing it for laugh. So we're not worried about them. On this rick bridge or or on that, like, perilous trained. Where the are being lifted off the tracks Al no about that.

260
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:35,889
Warren, you wanna tell us about what greet them upon their arrival at Chi.

261
00:29:36,585 --> 00:29:42,361
Right. Right there, they're they're in a hurry to get there. They think they're actually miles and miles. Like had Al Gladstone.

262
00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:48,835
Sure enough he's enjoying a fruit drink at a at a vendor, stand in fifty nine or whatever. And

263
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:58,815
that's Gladstone luck came through again and of course, Donald just livid. Right. And and the nephews give him the wise council to, like, stay out of sight

264
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:03,722
but he just immediately ignores that. Right. He he reveals himself

265
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:41,465
and you guys I'm not even that interested in in how Gladstone got there that fast. It's it's not it's not really that interesting. He basically met a guy who a rich local who sees him as a good luck charm, and he's just been hanging out. And and we kinda switch over to this glad stone segment while the the docs are doing at him beating beating them there, and he's just kinda trying to su out more details about their their shared pursuit. Why didn't they take a plane like theft out like bad storytelling to me. Like, he's so in service

266
00:30:41,765 --> 00:30:46,905
to Gladstone beating him that they are like, oh, we're gonna get a helicopter.

267
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:54,440
And then they take, like, a boat and then don't please. Yeah. They don't even bother with a plain.

268
00:30:54,935 --> 00:30:57,632
To get the bulk of the diff

269
00:30:58,211 --> 00:31:00,528
you didn't have radar artwork work though, Sarah Come on. Yeah.

270
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:02,805
They could've have flown over it.

271
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,300
Al plain?

272
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:29,245
Yeah. It's it's you're right. It's a plot hole. I also... I kinda gloss over it, but I... It occurred to me that You know, Donald is stew. I spend weeks getting here by the fastest means I could find. And you hop down here in Gladstone says four hours. It was a jet plain. That doesn't... The math doesn't work out there. Like, even a little bit. So. My my I flew to

273
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:38,077
Lima Peru from Atlanta, and it was six and a half hours. So no. That doesn't quite work. Right. We we even if we don't know exactly where Inducks

274
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:39,389
is. Like

275
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:44,731
Soda. So we know that. But But I mean, he's he never really like officially...

276
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:47,420
Yeah. Yeah. That seems like a stretch.

277
00:31:48,993 --> 00:31:51,869
And and so when we switch to Gladstone

278
00:31:51,989 --> 00:32:01,060
point of view, he's kinda disappointed because I he he apparently didn't expect them this soon and he had to pretend he didn't even know why they're there.

279
00:32:01,855 --> 00:32:05,351
So he starts to race off. But then we encounter

280
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,470
the gentleman

281
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:19,452
that he has apparently met and been hanging out with. Sarah, you wanna... You wanna tell us about Don't pedro? No alberto seems like he's kid kidnapping Gladstone.

282
00:32:19,612 --> 00:32:22,586
Linked twice if you're okay glad still.

283
00:32:23,123 --> 00:32:25,299
Can get with hospitality.

284
00:32:25,717 --> 00:32:27,230
Yeah. But he doesn't

285
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:37,762
let him leave. He's like, oh, you can't leave we have to have a party Oh, you can't leave now after the party. We have to have a raffle,

286
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:45,960
like it mean that guy. Not a good guy. He's got a very friendly bearing, but you're right. He's

287
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,198
he's very

288
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:48,297
enthusiastic.

289
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:50,334
Just there. Barks

290
00:32:51,053 --> 00:33:11,373
Do you remember a time Mark when you've seen Gladstone stone rest for such a long time where is is luck has to wait. I'm I'm trying to wonder what what other style. You know, I don't specific. I I think there's definitely been moments like this. But... But you another out of character moment like, are out of just bad storytelling, like,

291
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:13,170
Gladstone

292
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:20,217
doesn't worry and Gladstone doesn't get, like, tripped up and have things happen against as well. Right.

293
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:38,809
Or usually, he's thinks to himself. He actively thinks, oh, my luck is is working in some mysterious way here. But but it takes until it's gonna take... Like you said, it's a pretty good chunk of time lauren before he's realize why is locked is supposedly taking them here.

294
00:33:39,526 --> 00:33:44,172
Keeping in there. And and meanwhile, the docs are making some good progress

295
00:33:44,844 --> 00:33:45,623
And Barb,

296
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,091
Barks does a nice job here, I think of, like, showing

297
00:33:50,668 --> 00:33:52,460
how it's kind of this perilous

298
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,299
journey.

299
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:57,374
Right? He shows them swinging kinda like tarzan and to

300
00:33:57,713 --> 00:34:06,897
to confuse Gladstone trail him. And And then then there's a neat sequence where they're crossing this, like, crocodile and infested

301
00:34:07,556 --> 00:34:08,056
river

302
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:08,910
but

303
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,590
but there's a good gag where the Nephews asked if it's a Creek that he previously

304
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,770
referred to any he or if it's a river,

305
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:17,045
previously

306
00:34:17,465 --> 00:34:22,065
referred to, but he says, no, this is only a creek that flows into it.

307
00:34:22,745 --> 00:34:24,845
And and that's where Don Rosa

308
00:34:25,598 --> 00:34:48,650
you know, made the... He he use this panel to inspire him to make part of the cool cover that I do really like for this one that he did decades. Later. You guys I do really also like the couple of panels that show the Inducks on the next page kind of evading, some wildlife life. Mh. The Ducktales look a little bit out of scale compared to those arm ill

309
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,763
and and like, the jaguar.

310
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:54,445
But in a way that to me feels like oh in this

311
00:34:55,344 --> 00:35:40,140
jungle that's, you know, incredibly dangerous. I kept thinking about you talking about his Love for national Geographic these felt very inspired by National Geographic. Yeah. Yeah. I have no doubt that these are right out of it. It's it's really cool. Especially those arm in demos. I really like that. That I mentioned of them. Yeah. The realism of the of the images is is great mixed with the comic characters. And And and again, I I think just the the background art here is absolutely pure Barks genius. And then, of course, they they come to that that river. Which is white and shallow. Yeah. And and this, this is my favorite part of the story. I do. You you too. I love... I love this historic tables,

312
00:35:40,480 --> 00:36:00,860
see cats. I've never heard of them, and it's so invent and I wonder if bark... Barks created it, but did he research This is great. What do you think? It it is great and I've gotta tell you I... When I came to this part, I was like, oh, that's right. This is the story where the... Where he used the store tables. Because I I remembered

313
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:34,680
did he also use them in so far and no Safari later on. I feel like he might have used them in two stories. But anyway, I had I did not remember that they came from this one at least initially. And I got so excited. I was like, I'm doing this podcast where my stick is that I gotta go going in dive into all the details of this. So I'm gonna look up, you know, where your store tables come from? Because it's such a specific and evo name. Huey, couldn't I couldn't find anything you guys. I don't know that they're even a real thing.

314
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,620
I think he might have just made them up for this.

315
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:44,932
I just looked up store tables and all I found was like, side tables with really skinny legs. Right.

316
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:53,456
Right. It's like lines of of furniture. Right? Some of which I'm sure my wife would really like in our entry way.

317
00:36:54,395 --> 00:37:07,450
But, like I I was a little bit a little bit bummed to realize that store tables are not a thing. Maybe maybe, again, a listener can point out to me that oh, these were widely used in whatever country, but

318
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:14,850
But anyway, it is very invent. Right? The idea here is that because the... The river is so shallow,

319
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:23,046
it's that, like, it's too shallow for them to cross safely and a boat and and so they have to use these complementary

320
00:37:23,623 --> 00:37:28,010
pairs of very high tables that they fashion out of local

321
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,250
branches and stuff and they

322
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:44,210
they place one in front of the other and transfer themselves, and there's applies to cross. It's really cool. I love it. Yeah. I've never heard of them but, like, we all agree. It it... I think this is Pure Barks imagination. Kind of

323
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:51,803
reinventing that giant walking through the river on with these... What I look like stair steps or flip footsteps. Inducks.

324
00:37:52,003 --> 00:38:01,730
I think one of the that says is just like walking. And that's when it just dawned on me how they do it and yeah. The most invent creative part of the entire story. Are these?

325
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:14,211
We shu table ahead while we stand on table b then we step ahead on table a and move up table b. Yep. And, of course, the boys came up with it, and it came from their wood truck guy.

326
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:15,908
Yeah. Yes Oh basically

327
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:27,051
Take tune year wood shocks. It looks like a small book for so much knowledge doesn't. Yeah. And then so the the docks make it across the river, and they're very celebratory

328
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:28,863
saying that they're gonna

329
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,277
Gladstone

330
00:38:30,397 --> 00:38:34,687
for the first time and their lives. And that that feels like the signal.

331
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:38,709
Right? The narrator or signal that it's gonna go poorly for them now.

332
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:40,684
They

333
00:38:41,022 --> 00:38:47,165
see the pilot's marker, which is gonna lead them to the rep. And do you wanna tell us

334
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:49,445
warren about the raffle?

335
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:51,565
He the raffle back in Chi?

336
00:38:52,120 --> 00:39:02,274
Right. So now the Gladstone still looks rejected and here the the don and deputies are so close to that plane. But back there. Al last we have everyone here for the raffle is done Pedro.

337
00:39:02,652 --> 00:39:03,152
And

338
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:36,938
glad just looks so rejected. But then what is the prize? Well, we don't know what the price is But Gladstone does. And his eyes widened and he says, well, polish, my papa and eye eyeballs, I do want to win that and Well, we'll see. I I really like that line. I do and it's a neat. It's a neat little bit of entry, you know, readers with a good memory code. Can probably guess when it is. But I don't think I saw it coming as as a ten year old or whatever. Mh. I didn't see it coming as a forty three year olds. Yeah. There you go.

339
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:50,695
You guys... I'm gonna break for just a moment to mention that the fact that Gladstone has just been been sitting back there the whole time. This makes it feel like the story is almost one of those airport layover stories.

340
00:39:51,313 --> 00:40:23,765
Right? Like, it's it's so easy for Gladstone to do the thing Right he what that he's about to do to just kinda pair in to the story that some of that is what makes the the weight of the story less impactful for me. Yeah. There are very few moments where you actually do see during the the with the the heart of the story we're glad and donald actually do interact until the end. And it's right. So there is... Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah So the the Ducktales now, they know that they're really close to the wreckage

341
00:40:24,504 --> 00:40:27,801
and and we get a little reminder of the locals

342
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:29,375
as one of the Nephews

343
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:31,595
says, aren't they gonna hear us coming?

344
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:35,095
And Donald like, no. We'll sneak up on the plane quietly.

345
00:40:35,595 --> 00:40:36,095
And

346
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:41,911
as they arrive near where the they expect the plane to be, they hear some sounds.

347
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:44,882
And Sarah, do you wanna tell us about the sequence

348
00:40:45,872 --> 00:40:47,785
They discover Gladstone

349
00:40:48,024 --> 00:40:52,629
already going through a bunch of papers and throw them around like they're useless.

350
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:55,640
And and this kind of, like, Beg

351
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,060
disbelief to me too. Right? Gladstone

352
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,280
expects to find a treasure

353
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:19,475
So he's like just tossed out all these papers, but it seems reasonable that these papers could be what he's looking for. Mh. I I think so... I felt like that was pretty credible if he didn't really like, investigate what the papers were. Right? Like, if you just go with and and you have it in your brain

354
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:24,835
that you're going to find something, and then you don't find that thing It

355
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:45,640
Sure. You can... Yeah. It's believable that he was so upset by that that he did investigate what he did have. Right. Because he has been following what he believes to be a treasure map, but then on the next page, he's gonna specifically reference some old deeds and stuff. And I'm like, okay. That mean deeds, those are inherently valuable.

356
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,480
I mean, we are

357
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,520
millennials

358
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,375
who

359
00:41:50,112 --> 00:41:54,957
only just by the skin of our teeth were able to afford our own homes. So maybe

360
00:41:55,852 --> 00:42:00,213
more valuable than a dentist to us. But not to Gladstone.

361
00:42:00,373 --> 00:42:02,048
To Al oil will. Yeah. Yeah.

362
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:07,910
He tells them his story about how he got there before them. What what is it? Sarah?

363
00:42:08,683 --> 00:42:10,620
He got a helicopter ride.

364
00:42:11,437 --> 00:42:16,780
Right. That was the very? The very thing that Scrooge warned them against

365
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:22,254
Glad wasn't there to hear. So when he heard that there was a helicopter ride available

366
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:33,968
he took... He took it when he on the raffle. Right. You want one ticket out of ten thousand other tickets. So, again, it's a very... We're kind of returned to the incredible Gladstone luck.

367
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,320
The story. And and this is a pretty tense part of the story Right? Because the Ducktales

368
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,900
look genuinely fearful

369
00:42:43,255 --> 00:42:46,690
and they're tearing through the local jungle as Gladstone

370
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:51,418
explains I threw out some papers. Well and such Right.

371
00:42:52,575 --> 00:43:02,185
Black. Come on glad. When I emptied the pilot's duff bag, and and, you know, this this sets up the Ducktales racing to find the papers

372
00:43:02,642 --> 00:43:11,568
while they hear... They describe them as Indian war drums. That's an old an old trope. So they know that the danger is approaching.

373
00:43:11,945 --> 00:43:19,395
I I looked up... I tried to look up whether or not central American, indigenous people's used

374
00:43:19,772 --> 00:43:24,697
some kind of four. I I only just briefly lift up couldn't find anything.

375
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:35,315
But what I could find was, like a link to the, like, Us army five and drum core as if, like, board drums were dis stink,

376
00:43:35,732 --> 00:43:49,415
like, not white thing. Like, you'll have your symptoms. Like, don't other people for using drums in their military exercises is that not men in the... Right. Exactly. And this is just coded.

377
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,531
Yeah. And and so we kinda get the natural

378
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,917
resolution to this, where Gladstone

379
00:43:56,157 --> 00:43:58,132
realizes that he's got them

380
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,026
he's... He's got them to write.

381
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:16,860
They need to get the to recover these documents fast. So they can rely on his luck. And they do make the deal with him for for half of that fat reward. Warren you wanna tell us about Glad stone recovering them. Yeah. I I find this to be

382
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,260
more unbelievable than luck. But anyway, he

383
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:37,736
and I'm sure just a few minutes is able to... After promising to use his luck, he proves that he does have the ability by just simply reaching into a tree and pulling out two fat envelopes and grabbing the third one from a monkey, and that's it. That's all of it. All them

384
00:44:38,074 --> 00:45:04,102
is all bundled up in three bundles. I I thought that... It blew away, I I was having trouble with this, but I think Barks needed to continue this story pretty quickly. Now he's doing his page count. He goes well, I think I'd better wrap this up. That's me guys. Yep. Done We get a little transition where says one minute later. So he probably got a couple more of those really unlikely things, but it's all very... It's like kinda per.

385
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:18,635
Right? He doesn't even... He doesn't even do like three of them and then a a really funny one. It's Yeah. You know, he doesn't do that kinda rule of three or anything where maybe one of them would have floated under Donald hat or something like that.

386
00:45:18,972 --> 00:45:24,242
It's just the monkey holding one... That's not really much of a gas. That have.

387
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:30,411
Yeah. And and so to me, it didn't occur to me that it was kind of

388
00:45:30,711 --> 00:45:31,771
lazy storytelling.

389
00:45:32,311 --> 00:45:48,103
What it did for me was serve to prove the point that Donald Jealous just got in the way of an easy time. They It could've had glad don't help all along. Because all he had to do was, like, grab an envelope from Mom monkey and reach into a tree.

390
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,766
Right. I think the idea here is the only glad to like, this is

391
00:45:54,463 --> 00:46:16,860
an impossible task for a regular person. But bet you're right, he coulda cut he could've cut Gladstone in back and chi an, he should've have known that Jig was up But, of course, we we like to see this play out. This is yeah. This is the story the Barks wants to tell. Right. The cap to all of this is that they finally got it now they can dash out on glad stones

392
00:46:17,477 --> 00:46:17,977
helicopter

393
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,549
and this infuriating

394
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:20,826
relation

395
00:46:21,204 --> 00:46:25,176
tells them that he doesn't have any helicopter that went back to Chi.

396
00:46:25,754 --> 00:46:31,777
It was a one way ride a one way ride. Who ends a one way ride into the jungle.

397
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:36,581
And why would ten thousand people who live there want to do that? That's what I'm trying

398
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:37,700
out.

399
00:46:38,197 --> 00:46:45,616
Right. Right. Yeah. Except maybe he bargain for, like a a different. Maybe it's supposed to just be an excursion

400
00:46:46,356 --> 00:46:51,156
around. And he was like, not drop me off here. My luck... My luck will take me home.

401
00:46:52,356 --> 00:46:55,150
And so, you know, the the Ducktales sen

402
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:58,477
flee here, but Glad stone never has to worry.

403
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:03,102
Do you wanna do you wanna read... Tell me about Glad stones pen?

404
00:47:03,796 --> 00:47:05,236
Interaction here. Gladstone,

405
00:47:05,596 --> 00:47:05,676
like,

406
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:10,076
why would I run? Like, they're gonna be my friends.

407
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:14,895
Yeah. What does he think to himself? He he's reaching up to some

408
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:15,812
grapes

409
00:47:16,188 --> 00:47:20,476
that. Of course, they're growing in the Central American jungle.

410
00:47:21,556 --> 00:47:30,383
And he says they looked like a bunch of squares when my pilot was their rock piece and this helicopter coming out. Like a rock tv. Take a drink.

411
00:47:32,155 --> 00:47:32,655
Let's

412
00:47:32,992 --> 00:47:33,811
some American

413
00:47:34,865 --> 00:47:35,804
Native American

414
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:39,013
drives here. Right. This is definitely

415
00:47:39,872 --> 00:47:41,051
an ugly American

416
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:48,095
stereotype here. Barks is like, poking. Just a tiny bit of fun at that. But but mostly,

417
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:55,766
they're just the danger here. Yeah. He absolutely has no idea that there could be any danger until

418
00:47:56,105 --> 00:47:57,324
his hat gets

419
00:47:58,101 --> 00:47:59,098
smeared to a tree.

420
00:47:59,697 --> 00:48:01,653
Right. And and to be fair, you know,

421
00:48:02,491 --> 00:48:09,030
contacted tribes in this area, can be very dangerous to outsiders. And I would be to

422
00:48:10,205 --> 00:48:16,641
rightfully be left alone. It it is kinda cool the moment that they capture Gladstone

423
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:18,297
as he holds out his hands

424
00:48:19,114 --> 00:48:21,568
and they spear through his sleeves

425
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:24,379
as a way of kind of carrying him

426
00:48:25,557 --> 00:48:32,106
by by two two of the locals. But, again, they're just a threat And now Gladstone is in danger,

427
00:48:32,526 --> 00:48:35,346
and and the Ducktales have to have this, like, moral

428
00:48:35,686 --> 00:48:36,186
dilemma.

429
00:48:36,566 --> 00:48:42,958
What do you think more about the moral dilemma here? Well, they know the the more the dilemma here mean, they they know that these

430
00:48:43,856 --> 00:48:55,308
indigenous people of that that have captured Gladstone on did not see them. So Donald, Donald is saying well them, we can escape We can get out of here. Go home, let glad,

431
00:48:55,964 --> 00:48:58,698
luck his weight out of this. Well, the nephews

432
00:48:59,051 --> 00:49:27,491
are... No you can't do that. And then the dilemma is we have to say them he's a horrible jam In a way they're telling him he's family. And and that's how I saw it the that first panel of that next page. And most reaction is quite classic. The sticks come he knows that Gladstone still them, but we've got to throw that chance away. And I love find. Probably my favorite line life can be very un kind Yeah. Has five can be very. Un kind. I think be what's the story here.

433
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,708
Right. I thought it was a really good

434
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:35,949
characterization. That they were like, yeah, We could leave him

435
00:49:36,367 --> 00:49:40,137
because we know he has the luck, but we're gonna take the

436
00:49:40,594 --> 00:49:50,316
compassionate route and go ahead and we'll rescue him. And they. Talk donald into being more compassionate. And They're the same joel on his shoulder.

437
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:56,233
Right? Right, which he needs all of the time. Right. Because he knows, but he has to have it told.

438
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:00,936
What do you guys think of their the local city? That's quite beautiful

439
00:50:01,436 --> 00:50:07,376
but... I'd look at it as a a temple as something that was built by the indigenous people

440
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:09,831
for their home. And there's their social

441
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:20,434
gathering spot. And it's really nice. Right? Yep panel. Yeah. It it looks I mean, it has the mark of a great civilization, not quote savages.

442
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:26,073
Yeah. The way Barks is, like, showing it here, it's very permanent.

443
00:50:26,451 --> 00:50:38,969
It looks like great a great empire life the Al it doesn't... To me, it doesn't really evo Al tech, but but like, it it's very permanent. It doesn't look specifically my end or ast tech or anything

444
00:50:39,506 --> 00:50:40,205
that we're

445
00:50:40,902 --> 00:50:42,798
familiar with. But it does

446
00:50:43,350 --> 00:51:00,536
evo their, you know, create stone buildings that are... Obviously, they're still there that right that have stood the test of time because they were so permanent Right. Yeah and it's got this mix of, like, permanent stone, temple, like buildings as you say warren and then like, batch hut.

447
00:51:01,111 --> 00:51:06,051
It looks cool. It's it's nice art. So you guys this next sequence,

448
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:12,106
I don't wanna delve too much into it. But the this this is basically the classic,

449
00:51:12,526 --> 00:51:12,606
like,

450
00:51:14,886 --> 00:51:15,386
trope.

451
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:16,520
Of

452
00:51:17,377 --> 00:51:19,074
a group of European

453
00:51:19,611 --> 00:51:21,189
land in an indigenous

454
00:51:21,567 --> 00:51:23,503
society and they're mistaken

455
00:51:23,975 --> 00:51:25,074
Al got.

456
00:51:25,531 --> 00:51:30,499
Right? This is apparently a big part of what led to to ruin in the Caribbean

457
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:34,271
for the Barks when Columbus sara arrived they're genuinely

458
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:39,722
have been myths like this. And time miss and stuff that that

459
00:51:40,379 --> 00:51:43,192
invaders have taken advantage of and and here

460
00:51:43,649 --> 00:51:45,842
the Ducktales, the the big secret of,

461
00:51:46,759 --> 00:51:47,858
the big reveal

462
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:51,421
Warren you wanna tell us about their their statue.

463
00:51:51,759 --> 00:51:55,927
Yes. As they peer over the wall and they see guards with spears,

464
00:51:57,062 --> 00:51:57,336
it's

465
00:51:57,994 --> 00:51:58,773
it's certainly

466
00:51:59,189 --> 00:52:08,521
apparent to the Nephew and donald that it's gonna take something to get their cousin out of trouble. They see this quite striking statue with a...

467
00:52:08,981 --> 00:52:11,481
I'm gonna call it kind of a helicopter

468
00:52:12,101 --> 00:52:12,421
haircut.

469
00:52:13,061 --> 00:52:16,807
Kind of kind of a helicopter blade with like wings

470
00:52:17,184 --> 00:52:20,076
wings or something above above this very

471
00:52:20,493 --> 00:52:23,998
almost grow and scary kind of face. Which immediately,

472
00:52:25,213 --> 00:52:28,863
they say it looks like a helicopter. I saw that right away

473
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,096
so they could reinforce that

474
00:52:31,513 --> 00:52:36,095
is this this cross wings on his head are the sort of the...

475
00:52:36,871 --> 00:52:44,891
What they see it, then, of course, it's in the wood check manual there as well. They Right. The the picture writing says that he is

476
00:52:45,671 --> 00:52:46,171
brew

477
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,071
their spirit of deeds,

478
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:54,774
He flew down with those strange wings long ago and captured two, their god of good.

479
00:52:55,351 --> 00:52:57,366
So now we've got a little backstory

480
00:52:57,903 --> 00:52:59,081
about brew into

481
00:52:59,618 --> 00:53:14,256
and they kind of on on on unravel from there. It kind of reveals itself. Right. So Sarah, this was your first time reading this. Did you pretty much Did this kinda clue you in for the rest of the story once you saw

482
00:53:14,756 --> 00:53:22,696
the helicopter looking statue, and then we're gonna we're gonna see that the other good God or Spirit it's variable

483
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:26,403
is it to the God of Good eating who looks like Donald

484
00:53:26,796 --> 00:53:29,470
didn't think he looked like Donald. I went straight,

485
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:31,385
assuming that Gladstone

486
00:53:31,385 --> 00:53:49,956
good luck made it so that the god looked like him. It didn't occur to me that they would try to send Donald in first. Right. But that that that seems reasonable to me. But... But you've you got the scope of the story here that this is why we understand them to, like, freak out when they see helicopters.

487
00:53:50,576 --> 00:53:57,604
Not that you guys see the multiple blades, I guess, on Al helicopter when it's in motion. To me it looks like

488
00:53:57,982 --> 00:54:17,524
Venus store. Like, it looked like he had some kind of a plant growing out of his head and I have to read the words. To understand what was going on, but then, then I understood. Okay. So so you guys, they do the predictable thing. Here. They're they're going to their big plan is to disguise Donald as the God of eating.

489
00:54:18,163 --> 00:54:20,062
The kids have him memorized

490
00:54:20,456 --> 00:54:20,956
warren

491
00:54:21,336 --> 00:54:28,776
some of the the character work here, you're right. I'm noticing as I look at, like, the nephews here. It is not his best r.

492
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,984
As they're explaining the plan.

493
00:54:32,582 --> 00:54:45,087
I even wonder almost if it was retry, Jeez. Awesome hey, it's hard to say, but I I I I... Yeah. You've kind of echoed what I said earlier about the drawing looks looks a little bit more, like, dial it in phone in.

494
00:54:45,587 --> 00:54:50,210
But yeah. Or so who knows. So their plan is to...

495
00:54:51,186 --> 00:54:54,158
Is for Donald to walk in out ten

496
00:54:54,495 --> 00:54:55,513
memorized words

497
00:54:58,384 --> 00:55:19,276
I'll I'll say the words. Go guys. This is this is, like, this is... I'm annoyed even the say the words. This is the savage trope, right? Where we just make up language. And and this has been done by thousands of artists and riders over the years. So donald supposed to say arm two sc stew, which means roll out.

498
00:55:19,854 --> 00:55:27,950
Roll out red carpet, two back in town, and gl gl means I'll explain later and then

499
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:30,842
k clock bus could do.

500
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:33,271
Means release prisoner,

501
00:55:33,649 --> 00:55:37,038
him good gander from Mel egg.

502
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:41,742
Sarah, what do you what do you think about this stuff translating

503
00:55:42,242 --> 00:55:43,022
to bad

504
00:55:43,361 --> 00:55:59,698
dramatically bad English. Does that does that bother you a little? I it is in my notes that They they... They had... But even when they were like, speaking English for our benefit, it was some kind of offensive pigeon in English. Right. As if

505
00:56:00,012 --> 00:56:02,332
They can't just like beak words,

506
00:56:02,852 --> 00:56:12,281
Right, which is what languages are. If you translate, if you translate something into English, you are not supposed to like give it a a savage pigeon

507
00:56:12,778 --> 00:56:21,401
overlay. And and I know I understand this is the trope where this describing them as savages is the whole time, it's what he's looking for. But

508
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:26,141
it hasn't aged well to yeah to to be generous.

509
00:56:26,596 --> 00:56:57,319
I will say this. I agree with hug you, but I have to say that Al clock boost could do the what it means had me roaring laughing. I was laughing because kim good gander from Mel egg. I just... I don't know where he got that. Even if he said he is a good gander from a mel egg, that is reaching far into where he came. I just... I I I roar. I just... That's funny. I did... I agree with what the sentiment yeah But it was silly. It's it is kind of, like funny. Why would he why would they be saying mel?

510
00:56:57,938 --> 00:56:59,277
Exactly? Or can...

511
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:14,079
Yeah. There's no gander in Central America as far as I know, maybe there... Right. Right. And and then why would you translate an idiom, like, roll out the rad car? Right. Right. So it it's It's just it's kind of la

512
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:14,958
silly.

513
00:57:15,657 --> 00:57:16,157
Least

514
00:57:16,815 --> 00:57:23,280
it. That but is silly. I won't read too much into it. And so initially, this big

515
00:57:23,937 --> 00:57:25,475
does work but

516
00:57:26,012 --> 00:57:32,361
the natives are a little bit smarter than that. The the locals are a little bit smarter than that. They

517
00:57:32,901 --> 00:57:33,681
to verify

518
00:57:34,021 --> 00:57:36,401
that he is the real

519
00:57:36,716 --> 00:57:38,176
I saw someone commented

520
00:57:38,476 --> 00:57:42,336
online that it looks like the words spirit had been kind of

521
00:57:42,636 --> 00:57:48,559
replaced there. That it's probably god. You know, when the nephews are looking in through that brush.

522
00:57:49,278 --> 00:57:56,581
But they're probably both referred to as gods. Anyway, to what what do they wanna do, Sarah to prove that it's really him?

523
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:05,385
They want him to try on a gold crown. That is taken from the statue. Yeah. It's the old Cinderella bed. Right?

524
00:58:06,123 --> 00:58:07,902
Sure. So that's

525
00:58:08,295 --> 00:58:13,062
So it doesn't work. They they clock donald as the imp.

526
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:14,777
And the nephews

527
00:58:15,154 --> 00:58:23,922
come up with a really hasty plan here Warren you wanna tell us about it. Hasty and very clever. So They reach for some

528
00:58:24,339 --> 00:58:29,081
a Al slingshot and a good hard stone, the panel reveals that

529
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:36,356
this note wrapped around as Gladstone has hit Gladstone stone in the back of the head well. He's kind horribly chain

530
00:58:36,693 --> 00:58:41,261
by the neck to a pole. Right And then, of course, he's reading it and

531
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:46,937
mum these words, and then he just ends up and does mum the statement

532
00:58:47,353 --> 00:58:51,611
choose clumps too and it worked. So I'll go ahead and kind of

533
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:56,006
Yeah. Now it's now it's glad stones turn to try the ru.

534
00:58:56,585 --> 00:59:01,609
And we get... We get a fun little, I guess this little perspective switch to the nephews

535
00:59:02,065 --> 00:59:05,833
is kinda cute. Right? We see through their eyes. They're very suspense

536
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:07,321
if it's gonna work

537
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:15,032
One of them is covering their eyes afraid to look. The other reassure reassured them. And indeed, the crown fits

538
00:59:15,505 --> 00:59:19,511
the locals are celebrating that he is the real chew

539
00:59:20,245 --> 00:59:21,025
and the Nephews

540
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:21,941
craft

541
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:27,181
look and say, hopefully, he remembers the rest of the instructions.

542
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:30,533
Sarah, do you wanna tell us about the next part of the instructions?

543
00:59:31,046 --> 00:59:32,826
Gladstone says look

544
00:59:33,126 --> 00:59:38,526
scrub off thumb, and then he has a little thought bubble that it's very handy for us readers.

545
00:59:39,101 --> 00:59:42,721
That says the kid's note said that that means

546
00:59:43,261 --> 00:59:46,296
everybody go into the jungle fetch game for big fees

547
00:59:46,756 --> 00:59:51,016
Right. And so that does it The Ducktales.

548
00:59:51,076 --> 00:59:54,096
The docs plus gander are able to

549
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:55,629
escape. And

550
00:59:56,127 --> 01:00:02,613
they're kind of, like, as they walk back towards the coast or wherever, Donald is venting about how

551
01:00:02,952 --> 01:00:10,457
great Now Glad stone has half of our reward money and that that crown, which is gonna be really valuable.

552
01:00:11,331 --> 01:00:11,770
Of course,

553
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:13,309
large

554
01:00:14,687 --> 01:00:19,303
steel, the breakfast they've stolen and that that price was start to fit.

555
01:00:21,254 --> 01:00:31,309
And then... But but we do get... We do get so warren, we've noted that sometimes the duct come out ahead, sometimes glad stone comes out ahead on these stories.

556
01:00:31,688 --> 01:00:37,356
Tell us about the outcome with this one. Well, glad still didn't quite come out ahead although he used his head

557
01:00:38,616 --> 01:01:03,642
he had to give back the reward money to pay for our our tip that saved his scalp and then explained to donald that the crown only fit because when they use the slingshot with the rack, it took good aim, so that would create kind of this big nut in the back of his head, that would be the only reason this crown stayed on. And look, what he says, the goose egg is starting to un swell at last and of, of course, the last panel. Go ahead.

558
01:01:04,759 --> 01:01:15,251
Right. Yeah. It's it's it's a clever bit. Do bit. Yeah. It's a it's a funny bit. Yeah. So Glad stone gonna have to, like, pay someone now to remove the crown.

559
01:01:15,786 --> 01:01:18,546
And and they're all gonna break even, I guess.

560
01:01:19,466 --> 01:01:23,161
It's a lot of trouble to have gone through for all banking even. Yeah.

561
01:01:24,396 --> 01:01:29,058
That's it. So, yeah, you guys... That is the secret of Honda

562
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:39,023
We... None of us were very kind to it. But maybe we can each say something that we did enjoy. About this story.

563
01:01:39,481 --> 01:01:47,492
Warren, do you wanna go first? What what was your favorite aspect of it? Well, I I think I some of the Carl Barks is invent,

564
01:01:48,109 --> 01:01:50,262
the Barks tables in the middle of the story.

565
01:01:51,436 --> 01:01:54,356
Just added to the whole tracking through the jungle.

566
01:01:55,317 --> 01:02:01,669
And the artwork work in the jungle, the background artwork some of the splash panels were pretty memorable.

567
01:02:02,847 --> 01:02:04,226
And and again, the nephews

568
01:02:04,725 --> 01:02:10,116
kinda came through and save the day. It's it's something he likes to repeat. But I think as a story,

569
01:02:10,776 --> 01:02:29,847
I will say what I said earlier, the the first half goes very slow for me just as a story and and not even factoring in some of the language choices and some of the depiction that we talked about. It just really felt that he was trying to put into a twenty four page story. That's me. And then Al the the the last part became more of a comedy

570
01:02:30,241 --> 01:02:30,741
and

571
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:33,781
it kinda picked up the pace a little bit

572
01:02:34,281 --> 01:02:36,981
in the last month five or six pages actually

573
01:02:37,495 --> 01:02:58,794
we're a little bit more entertaining that terrific, but but a little bit more entertaining. So... And I love travel stories that take the Inducks out of America and bring them to foreign countries. This one just didn't have the charm and the romance of some of the others. Yeah. Alright. That's fair. It's it's a re tread in a lot of ways. He's you know, I'm I'm kind of collecting on the Barks remarks

574
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:17,974
map where the docs have been. And if you look at it, they've they've kind of been to the area Al lot. So I don't know that he's really bringing much new to the table on. Right. But what not use sarah, your overall thoughts, and if you can start If if you can start with something nice. I like the jaguar.

575
01:03:20,784 --> 01:03:23,256
I love cats. I love big cats,

576
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,427
And so, of course, I was like, okay.

577
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:29,763
When they were going through the series

578
01:03:30,341 --> 01:03:37,896
with encountering all of the crocodile dials and our materials and jaguar and junk. Sure. My overall thoughts are

579
01:03:38,676 --> 01:03:43,707
that it it didn't age well. I... I mean, not a lot of them do.

580
01:03:44,286 --> 01:03:48,076
Some of them are spectacular, but so many are not

581
01:03:48,776 --> 01:03:59,475
in that respect. And it didn't... Like you were saying, it didn't even have, like, a good story to to redeem it in some other way. I tend to dislike Donald Jealousy

582
01:03:59,812 --> 01:04:10,823
and, like, kind of dis emotional maturity. Anyway... I know you know you hate it when people just don't talk to each other. Too. Right. And I... And I don't I don't understand

583
01:04:11,242 --> 01:04:16,397
look. I don't understand Glad stone and his self awareness about the luck.

584
01:04:17,252 --> 01:04:26,085
I would just be like, I would find it more believable if he didn't had any have any idea about the left because right that kind of an x journal

585
01:04:26,502 --> 01:04:27,002
assessment,

586
01:04:27,378 --> 01:04:37,765
cube, he doesn't know any different because he's never not been like this. So why does he call it let Why doesn't he just say like, oh, why don't you guys have this? So, like, Gladstone,

587
01:04:38,204 --> 01:04:46,144
Hai doesn't make sense to me? That either? I mean, he he he'll make more sense to you, I think, if you if you think of him as

588
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:47,301
exclusively

589
01:04:47,879 --> 01:04:52,069
foil for Dawn. Right Right. He has only meant to H Donald

590
01:04:52,727 --> 01:04:56,903
insecurities about himself. But I hate donald his security.

591
01:04:59,293 --> 01:05:01,269
Sure. I I get it.

592
01:05:01,646 --> 01:05:03,382
Yeah. So that's the...

593
01:05:04,198 --> 01:05:07,091
And and remember too that bark

594
01:05:07,708 --> 01:05:15,542
himself. Kate flat stuff. Right? Like, this is his own creation. He did not... He he... With Scrooge, he saw a lot to redeem.

595
01:05:16,196 --> 01:05:21,171
In Scrooge and he developed him into a a more fully fleshed out character

596
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:25,401
still has his problematic elements, but there's a lot to like about him. Barks

597
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:33,757
has never like been like, oh, let me give Gladstone his wine and give him these these elements no. He's just Huey,

598
01:05:33,837 --> 01:05:46,306
just exists to be an an ear attendant for non. Saying that though Mark, I will say there was an element I said it earlier about Gladstone in the story. There was a little bit more of a character study than in the past. There was this moment...

599
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:58,769
Several pages actually were glad still Glad luck didn't reveal itself. And what it did it revealed it in the big way. But when Don pedro and his his is gathering was keeping him captive, this sort of accidental

600
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:05,382
kidnapping. Right. I I I felt that we we looked a little bit more into a little bit more into

601
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:06,237
where

602
01:06:06,576 --> 01:06:08,114
glad is a character

603
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:18,432
maybe struggles with where the next lucky break will come. And there was just a little bit more of that humanity... And then maybe that's too strong of a word. But so I thought that maybe

604
01:06:18,812 --> 01:06:19,992
Carl was giving

605
01:06:20,452 --> 01:06:23,207
Glad a bit more of the stage in the story

606
01:06:24,066 --> 01:06:27,242
I mean we see a lot more of his, like, interior

607
01:06:27,581 --> 01:06:28,081
monologue

608
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:37,192
than we usually do. For Sure. I I do feel like it is it is Gladstone at his most glad stone in this story. My my...

609
01:06:37,570 --> 01:07:03,798
I guess, what is this? It's like the rose and Thorn thing Right? My my rose for this story is that I do love the store table bit. And I like a lot of the version through the jungle. I I don't think it's like an outright bad story. It's just so bland. In a lot of ways and and uni inspiring, that, like, there are there are Barks stories that are technically maybe bigger mis hires

610
01:07:04,111 --> 01:07:04,930
or failures

611
01:07:05,867 --> 01:07:15,679
that I I actually like better even if they're not technically as good of a story. This one is just really pedestrian really boring in some regards.

612
01:07:16,535 --> 01:07:23,755
Boring is too too harsh. It's it's just it's not Al it's siding. It's not as engaging as a lot of recent

613
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:25,969
stories that I've been covering. You know?

614
01:07:27,286 --> 01:07:50,574
I was just gonna say it makes you wonder how excited by Scott about the assignment or about this particular story. And maybe that's why It's on the editors desk for a month, you know could be yeah. It just... It feels a little bit. It feels a little bit half hard. Yeah. So when when we look, this is gonna be an interesting one. Right? Because we all feel pretty harsh about this one. So how about the community?

615
01:07:51,372 --> 01:07:53,884
If we check in with Inducks,

616
01:07:53,884 --> 01:08:02,254
you will find that the canadian she likes this pretty well. You know, it's not it's not a favorite of theirs. But

617
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:07,653
when you look at the voting Inducks, as of today it as a seven point six.

618
01:08:08,111 --> 01:08:14,791
Which is good for number one hundred and ninety eight of all the forty three some thousand stories on Inducks

619
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:22,071
because I am such an excessive, you know, I I kinda broke out the adventure stories into their tiers

620
01:08:22,408 --> 01:08:41,281
into different, like, groups and if you look at this one it lands in the tier of stories that I described as, like typical Barks, right, the average Barks story. And And within that group, it's in the upper half of the average Barks story. So roughly in the fiftieth

621
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:42,118
percentile

622
01:08:42,495 --> 01:08:44,385
of of Barks,

623
01:08:44,624 --> 01:08:48,595
specific stories, which I think is very very generous

624
01:08:48,974 --> 01:08:52,108
for this one. I I'm trying to remember

625
01:08:52,461 --> 01:09:00,892
stories that I've enjoyed less than this one that I've covered so far on the podcast, and I think the only ones that come to mind would be like,

626
01:09:01,783 --> 01:09:03,401
volcano Valley. And...

627
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:10,138
That one though, I kind of loved to hate. Sure. So it had... It it just had him acting

628
01:09:10,491 --> 01:09:12,786
so terribly, I found it hilarious.

629
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:18,786
Mh. So it had that going for it. This one I didn't hate that much. Right. It it was

630
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:24,094
I really dislike Volcano Valley. It's one of my least favorite Barks stories,

631
01:09:24,551 --> 01:09:35,993
but it's definitely more interest then this one. And then like, too many pets, but that's not really fair because that's barely even Barks. He, you know, he finished that assignment

632
01:09:36,465 --> 01:09:39,558
maybe, oh, I guess in darkest Africa.

633
01:09:39,896 --> 01:09:50,947
That one was... Or that was similarly a bit fun fire. I think I even liked land of the tote pulls better than this one. I was gonna bring that one up. I think land the tote poles

634
01:09:51,365 --> 01:09:54,991
parallel this a little bit. Yeah. I found it more interesting

635
01:09:55,926 --> 01:10:30,936
than Right. Story. And I'm I'm Al little surprised by the community rating on as well. And not just because of the story, and I'll say it again. I think the artwork... I I think Barks is entering the last ten years of his career with the comics and and I just don't think he's in there... With the exception of a few of the stories that are coming up, I just don't think Huey, as as inspired as he was during we called that golden era. Yeah. Warren, you and I had... We've gotten beyond with Patrick Block before. One of the great Inducks artists, which has been awesome. Yeah I he... I can't remember when, but he's talked at length about, like, Barks. Had some point here Barks

636
01:10:31,736 --> 01:10:33,491
switch to the type of paper

637
01:10:33,991 --> 01:10:36,311
or the type of pencil he used.

638
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:50,407
Does that sound familiar? I don't remember him saying that that might the part of the reason, but he I wonder if it was Henri who... I... I've got... I've been, like, really fortunate to get to talk to a number of the Artist. I a couple of them

639
01:10:50,784 --> 01:10:53,058
have mentioned to me it might have been

640
01:10:53,855 --> 01:10:59,116
Someone had educated me about, like, one of the the ways that he switched using

641
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:07,322
to a different pencil for a while, and that impacted his art for a span of time. Yeah. Forgive me previous gas for

642
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:15,532
for forgetting who told me that. But... But that's it's neat to see maybe this is part of that So anyway,

643
01:11:16,784 --> 01:11:18,801
One, I'm not aware of any,

644
01:11:19,299 --> 01:11:20,239
like, sql

645
01:11:21,095 --> 01:11:21,595
or

646
01:11:22,373 --> 01:11:27,999
oil painting things lit those that you did for this one. No Barks paintings on this one. I've.

647
01:11:28,498 --> 01:11:40,166
You've already mentioned the the the Rosa cover. Yeah. It's the cool one. And he did that But other than that, there early hasn't been much more. And I I didn't... I didn't check to see if there was a duck

648
01:11:40,706 --> 01:11:43,606
adaptation. I don't remember this whenever occurring.

649
01:11:44,361 --> 01:11:49,494
Ever carrying in any episode of got. I don't think this one really

650
01:11:49,913 --> 01:11:53,900
had much of a, you know, after Al life or impact.

651
01:11:54,436 --> 01:12:10,223
Do you guys have any favorite panels that we should mention that we didn't get to? Sarah, you don't. I I do like I do like when the Gladstone gets carried away by those spears even though it's a a an uncomfortable moment

652
01:12:10,602 --> 01:12:17,271
and and I always appreciate that store table moment where they're surrounded by the crocodile dials from that

653
01:12:17,891 --> 01:12:25,951
perspective kind of looking up. I think the bridge with the donkey with the Bee behind on the tail was memorable. And there's that one panel that we're

654
01:12:26,506 --> 01:12:27,186
Gladstone

655
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:28,446
discovers the

656
01:12:29,066 --> 01:12:31,806
the prize. And Oh, yeah. He's kinda.

657
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:41,956
He says his line in beam actually has little shades of what I would call the classic forty nine nineteen fifty glad stone with the longer beak. Other than that, glad Stones

658
01:12:42,931 --> 01:12:47,020
characterization is is to me pretty bland. Yeah. Those are some good panels. Excellent.

659
01:12:47,637 --> 01:13:14,651
Any closing thoughts sarah? No. And connected it all my notes. Yeah. I'm good. I think I got to say what I wanted to say. How about you were? No. Thanks for revisiting the story with us, and I think it's great that we all see the flaws I think that just shows in any artist doesn't have his his best day all the time. And and now I don't know how Barks felt about it. No. Nothing else to say other than I look forward to the next time we all gather. Right. For sure. And and if you listen

660
01:13:15,151 --> 01:13:19,802
if you do feel strongly about this one feel free to reach out and and yell at me.

661
01:13:20,602 --> 01:13:31,883
Yell Al us and let us know why. Differences of opinion are are totally fine. You can reach out We are... We have a presence on the socials, Barks remarks is on Facebook and

662
01:13:32,522 --> 01:13:33,516
Instagram. And

663
01:13:33,856 --> 01:13:44,994
So you guys for... I I always mention what we're coming out with next. This is a little bit of a tricky one because I I don't usually say what's coming next for the ten page podcast.

664
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:50,186
I usually stick with the adventure stories, but this is kind of a weird one because the next

665
01:13:50,805 --> 01:13:55,461
episode we do is pretty special. I'm gonna be covering the riddle of the red hat

666
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,978
Oh is is famously

667
01:13:58,317 --> 01:14:05,971
Carl Barks is only Mickey mouse story. Well, that will be good. Yeah. And we're doing that in time for

668
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:08,963
Nikki birthday on November eighteenth.

669
01:14:09,475 --> 01:14:11,015
Yeah timing it for that.

670
01:14:11,395 --> 01:14:13,336
And then I've I've got a

671
01:14:13,876 --> 01:14:17,876
episode coming out for Thanksgiving with a couple of things thanksgiving stories.

672
01:14:18,529 --> 01:14:25,604
Soon and so the next proper duck adventure story that we're gonna be doing is is gonna be a real doo.

673
01:14:26,315 --> 01:14:29,370
It is going to be the land beneath the ground.

674
01:14:30,187 --> 01:14:42,803
Which I'm very excited to cover Sarah, you might know that one It's from the duck openings sequence when he's in the Mine going beneath the ground. Does that sound familiar? They meet the the the weird little characters

675
01:14:43,462 --> 01:14:44,941
that create earth earthquake.

676
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:46,333
Oh

677
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:48,105
as I always wanted to meet them.

678
01:14:49,500 --> 01:15:00,233
It is an exciting one. Especially as a somebody who went to school for radiology. Those features have been very interesting to me. They would be. Alright. Sarah, do you mind

679
01:15:00,692 --> 01:15:11,280
reading the the last panel to close us out? And by the time he's paid somebody to cut that jagged thing off his neck, we'll all just about break even on this trip Awesome.

680
01:15:11,618 --> 01:15:16,433
Thank you guys. You you have been good gander from mel eggs, and I appreciate.

681
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:17,970
God.
