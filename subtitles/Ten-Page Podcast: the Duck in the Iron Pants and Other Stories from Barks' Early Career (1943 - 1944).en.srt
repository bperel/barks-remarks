00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:25,185
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of sc Mc Ducktales and writer and artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge con of all time

2
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:40,390
This episode is a ten page podcast all about one of his short stories, get ready to enjoy our remarks. Well back to Barks remarks. We are back with a very special episode of what I call the ten page podcast

3
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:50,085
Usually, we pick one or two of Barks short ten page stories to discuss. But today we're gonna do something a little bit different

4
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:58,660
And I think very special. We are gonna talk about a group of no less than five stories from the Ducktales

5
00:00:59,313 --> 00:01:04,838
very early career. And and I got a little more pro, but I've got a c host

6
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:12,473
that I'm very excited to have Barks so I'll let him introduce himself Hey Barks more harmon and back again, enjoying these

7
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:33,127
early comics so much. Really really looking forward to our discussion and kinda of tracking Carl Barks his early career. So excited. Yeah. This will be fun. Yeah. I I agree. I am very excited to touch on it. You know when I when I started this podcast series, I was thinking long and hard about it. And I really was like I've gotta focus

8
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:37,912
on those adventure stories, those longer stories, you know, That's my format

9
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:53,026
and and I really wanted to stick to it because there were just so many of the ten pager. But but I ultimately did decide that it made a lot of sense to be a little bit flexible so that I could get the the special ten page podcast

10
00:01:53,723 --> 00:02:07,971
episodes in and like I compromised where I was like, I'm gonna to stick with the spirit of what I'm doing by by numbering those longer episodes and labeling these others as the ten page plot asked. But it means I didn't make that decision

11
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:24,570
until a couple of months in. And so it means that I I passed by all of these great old stories that really showed some of his like, evolution. So so I thought about it, and I was like, oh this is this is the perfect compromise,

12
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,410
you know, we're gonna we're gonna talk about five really

13
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:41,286
interesting stories here. None of which would really kind of them really have enough meat in them, I think to merit their own episode, even a shared one. But but what we're gonna do today is

14
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:43,138
talk about those stories,

15
00:02:43,477 --> 00:02:47,613
summarize them in a lot less detail than we usually would, and then we're gonna

16
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:49,945
think about what it says

17
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:52,899
about the Ducktales man's early career

18
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:54,714
and his evolution.

19
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:56,111
So so warren...

20
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:11,914
How do you feel in general? You know, about these early ten pager the first part of his career. Right? Right? And and coming off of his partnership with Jack hanna and finds p Gold and nineteen forty two where he kinda got a taste of the comic book

21
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:24,150
industry and and got to experience the art as you said, this is i was a great word, the evolution of the artist and the writer. And I think why I think these stories are so important is that they

22
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,895
pave the way to what he mastered later in his life.

23
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:53,051
So you see a lot of that moments in these stories that say, hey, I remember seeing that kind of thing happen in lost in the Andes or luck of the North or those longer form stories. So here's a man who at the age of about forty or forty one. He's so over forty. He's over forty. Yeah. And he's got this twenty three year career left, and this is just getting started

24
00:03:53,429 --> 00:04:08,574
and that just amaze me. And this why I'm so excited because I think as an individual and it's a creative individual. I think he just wants to tell these stories. It it's it's really critically important that we understand where Karl Barks was. Yeah. I I fully agree.

25
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:14,232
That's why I definitely think it's important to cover these stories as part of this podcast project

26
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:29,840
but but I also think they're very enjoyable and fun. And you made a great point there about this stage of his life. And I think about that a lot. Right? Because, like, he... This is... I don't know how many careers in into his

27
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:38,025
into his life. But this is certainly not his first career, and this is a really big change to have made.

28
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:45,340
At this age at this stage in his life. I would say this is his third career. You know when he started out and and he started with

29
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:56,550
the Calgary eye opener and and he had that publishing and editing experience with the incompetence in Minneapolis that he had to work with for those early years. Then he got fed up with that and went to

30
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:11,146
California back to California and and looked in liquid did it Disney, while working in the story department and working on the Donald duck Shorts. And then he said, look, I'm gonna move seventy five miles with my first wife Clara to the small community

31
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:21,035
where the weather's is beautiful. The mountains are beautiful, and I'm gonna set up my little freelance practice there and see what I can do. I mean, this is his third attempt and he's now his forties. And I can kind relate to that.

32
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:39,264
I jumped from one long career in Minneapolis and at the age of forty two, I moved to Rochester and started something new. So Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. I relate to... you know, i'm I'm at about that stage in my life right now, and I'm I'm looking at a little bit of a shift within my own career

33
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:49,270
and doing doing the series it's impossible not to think of that. And and it's... I I find it really in expiring. Right? Because he obviously had a lot of his best

34
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,490
work ahead of him still. Oh,

35
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,643
extremely inspiring and he had the talent. No question. But what I think was

36
00:05:57,022 --> 00:06:24,067
incredibly fortunate about this period for him. Everything lined up the stars is aligned. He had people who trusted him. They didn't second guess and we'll talk about the first story here and how the editor just said, wow. You know, here you go. You you can do this in Yeah, they they did give him a lot of latitude for these. Right? But but I also get the impression that he was one of those people who really tried to, like, make his own luck you know, he he put himself in the right place. He obviously

37
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:27,663
built up a lot of goodwill as someone who was reliable

38
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:34,504
working on those Disney shorts and And these, you know, it should be said that these serve as a great bridge

39
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:42,610
between the work that he did on those cartoon shorts especially Donald Duck and what he's gonna go on to do with the dot comics. But, you know,

40
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,350
when he got that opportunity

41
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:48,536
to do pirate gold with Jack hanna,

42
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:56,000
my read is that they really liked what they saw. Oh yeah. And and they really must have liked the sales

43
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:09,197
outcome what is. And I think that probably gave him the confidence to think that he could he could do this. I I understand he gave himself a little bit of an insurance policy where he he brought a bunch of

44
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,650
You print a bunch of chicken coops with with

45
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,930
to sandwich

46
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:14,790
sin.

47
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:20,863
Yeah. Yeah. Yep. He brought his chickens and his chicken coops and like they say with his wife and

48
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:25,397
they kinda set up a little kinda like, okay. This doesn't work out. I'll be a typo before.

49
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:32,544
Here's the fall back. Well... And and and is he had previous careers doing other like, very outdoor

50
00:07:33,482 --> 00:07:44,218
rural stuff. Right? Didn't he do some like some sort of ranch hand or trapping or or not in his twenties. Yeah. In his twenties and growing up. I think he was always outdoors.

51
00:07:44,795 --> 00:08:00,935
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Well, I'm I'm getting excited to talk about these. So are you ready? The launch into were? Do you any any other pre game Well I think I think we'll just kind of talk about the evolution here and it starts with Walt Disney comics and stories number thirty one.

52
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:19,466
Yeah. Let me let me list him off really quick. So we're gonna be talking today about the victory garden from walt Disney's comics and stories, number thirty one in April of nineteen forty three, followed by the Rabbit foot and the next issue while Disney's comments in stories thirty two then we're gonna be covering

53
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:31,015
salesman Donald in issue number thirty nine, followed by the duck in the iron pants. And number forty one. And finally, the mad chemist number forty four. And

54
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:38,097
let's let's talk about why we're doing the ones we are. Right? I I think

55
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:48,110
I think that any project like this we really have to cover the victory garden. Right? Warren. What why is that? Well, the Victory Garden was Carl Barks is first

56
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,270
opportunity to broad original

57
00:08:51,770 --> 00:09:08,110
ten page story for Walt Disney's comics and stories and and since he moved away from Burbank and and the Disney studios and kinda ended his career with Walt Disney as a staff or he pulled pulled all his stops and became a freelancer He settled into this area where he could really

58
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,670
exercise his creative

59
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,044
skills And

60
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:18,023
they gave him this opportunity. It says in Donald Alt book, and I wanna give credit to the research here that

61
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:28,470
he believes that woman's name was Eleanor Packer who was an editor who gave him that opportunity to draw this story. Now this was not an original

62
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:37,355
story either though. The the the thing to know here is that he was handed to script or an outline, I and it was... As he says, it was a rather

63
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:47,743
indefinite sort of script. I worked it over and it made more sense out of it. And it was one of the things that they were kinda testing Carl Barks here in his ability to come up with something

64
00:09:48,082 --> 00:09:49,261
that would cap

65
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,100
and

66
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:52,137
get the editors at Western

67
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:53,136
printing

68
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:56,540
excited. Yeah. I I think you've got it. Right? He...

69
00:09:57,554 --> 00:10:04,745
The bit that I have that Jeffrey Blu had written in their care of the graphic novel that I read most of these in.

70
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:20,824
Just notes that, you know, he was allowed to strengthen what he thought needed punching up, but but that he focused most of his effort on the art. So and the art fantastic i even shows in my opinion to shows an evolution from finds pirate gold and

71
00:10:21,284 --> 00:10:36,884
of this expressive donald duck that we see today, I think it's closer to what what he ended up with. I think he had a a great opportunity to to really work on the art on this story. So Yeah. Let's let's talk about the victory garden. Should we start there? Yeah. Absolutely.

72
00:10:37,224 --> 00:10:38,884
We're gonna we're gonna go chronological.

73
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:39,964
So...

74
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:46,220
Okay. So so go ahead, warren and tell us tell us about the main action that give us a good summary

75
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:54,803
of the victory garden. Yeah. It's important to note that victory gardens were real popular at the height of World War two in America, United Kingdom,

76
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,515
Australia, other parts of the World, Canada.

77
00:10:57,969 --> 00:10:59,347
And these were

78
00:11:00,004 --> 00:11:01,182
gardens that

79
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:12,984
citizens of the countries were encouraged to grow to help the war effort. To grow their own food. But what I thought fascinating about it was it was a spirit builder. It was a Al builder. For the citizens

80
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:26,090
during this incredibly horrible war. And it was an opportunity to get out and planned community gardens in vacant lots and in backyard. And so the the story, the victory garden opens with Don is and Nephews

81
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:55,255
real real quick one and I'm sorry to interrupt. But... Oh no. That that's that's important. I appreciate you defining like, what a victory garden is. Right? Because it's presented in this story is something that every reader would would know about. Did you know what a victory garden was before you originally read this story? I did. My my mom was ten years old in nineteen forty three, and she remembers planting her victory garden in minneapolis. That's cool. I

82
00:11:55,634 --> 00:12:03,426
I had no idea what a Victory garden was. I learned about it literally from this comic probably at about the age of ten years old.

83
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:22,294
Wow. And and I had to... I I can't remember if I asked someone or if I looked it up pre Google, but I I did not know because there's no real direct reference in the story. To war. Right? They just... They're just talking about we're gonna start up a victory garden. Yeah.

84
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,531
And it really interests me that you don't really see them in other pop culture.

85
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:32,394
Like, no. You don't really see them in other comics. You you rarely

86
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:49,708
see them referenced in movies of the time. Right. It was Al an effort that maybe was grassroots. Maybe it started. I don't know if the government encouraged it. I it probably did. I I think there was a big you know, propaganda efforts. Yeah to to get them. And and we we know that there was a lot of

87
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:51,582
Donald duck propaganda

88
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:56,223
material mate too. So I I have to think that this is probably

89
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,618
something that

90
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:09,670
maybe got re reworked out of some of that because I... You know, I wanted on there. Donald Ducktales really went to bat for the war effort first. He did a good friend of mine just sold his entire

91
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:15,834
Donald duck a war collection at heritage auctions, and he lives in Minneapolis. And

92
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:26,459
anyway, Donald Duck, I think the other part of this is that we're at the height of World war two, but you made the point and it was a right point that that Donald duck became sort of the the visual

93
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:40,838
symbol of the war for Disney as walt Disney entered the war effort. And I'm gonna say, whether I'm right or wrong or whatever, I'm gonna say that Donald Ducktales surpassed mickey Mouse popularity during these years in terms of, you know, in the comics in the short cartoons.

94
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:41,715
Popular

95
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:45,480
consciousness. Yeah. No arguments here. Absolutely.

96
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:55,575
That's what excited me. Probably would got me excited about collecting Donald Duck. So, yeah, the story begins with Donald and the boys wanting to plant garden. And

97
00:13:55,955 --> 00:14:04,268
what I really love is that as they begin planting this victory garden in earnest, you see these three crow sitting up on the on the line and

98
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:10,341
immediately reminded me of of the crow in the movie dumb that was premiered two years earlier.

99
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:21,650
They're Sassy. They're kinda commenting the mag pies I have a feeling Carl Barks was inspired by the crow from Dumb. And as they are excited about seeing this victory garden go, they

100
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,890
they see food on their table, and so they

101
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:36,060
leap off the pole and start getting eating the food. Donald gets fed up with it and calls them sa and throws things at them and and it's. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

102
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:37,760
To.

103
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,775
Because because they're, like, sa his his war effort

104
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:42,635
Exactly.

105
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:53,858
Exactly. And who knows if the crow symbolic in any way to the to the axis I doubt it, but but said they're sort of the trouble here. Are. There are three of them. Yeah.

106
00:14:54,514 --> 00:15:05,655
Yeah. So the the overarching theme here is Donald attempt to plant a victory garden. Every chance he gets gets t. And so he he tries it in his yard. He goes to a vacant

107
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:06,630
lot

108
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:07,869
in the neighborhood.

109
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:14,620
Beautifully, I just have to point out at the... What is the decor of faith and hope. I love that. And some

110
00:15:14,975 --> 00:15:20,715
And then he he does everything to try to deceive these crow even dress up you know a woman's costume,

111
00:15:21,095 --> 00:15:27,593
and it doesn't fool them. And so every attempt whether it's the crow or the boys playing football

112
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:34,387
on the garden he planted in the vacant lot, he just he just gives up and it... I love the ending when

113
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:43,335
the boys and conveniently go to the seed store and find invisible seeds. And they t the crow by opening the bag and there's nothing there. And

114
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:46,165
they presented to Donald and his bad while he's

115
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:48,611
hovering from his football

116
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:49,968
catastrophe.

117
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:53,855
He throws the bag against the wall in the next morning Voila.

118
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:59,804
The victory guardian is growing in his bedroom. Really fun. That that was a great synopsis

119
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:02,720
warren. That this is a really interesting

120
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:18,653
story to start with. Right? Because some... Some parts of this really do feel like it's right out of the cartoon, you know, that... Especially that element with the like, invisible seeds. That feels like something that would happened in one of the cartoons where like this is gonna be fun,

121
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:52,563
slaps stick and silly and we don't care why they're invisible. We're not gonna explain that they're just they're so small that they're they might as well. Now, there's invisible seeds, give donald the invisible seeds we like that visual of the vegetables growing out of his hardwood floors. Yeah. Well, again, you have remember Carl Barks coming off his story ideas at the animation studio. So he he he wrote this like a cartoon, and and this easily could have been a cartoon as you said. In fact, carl Barks would take because were so few panels in in these

122
00:16:53,179 --> 00:17:08,108
three row comics. These three rows here. Right. And there are ten pages. He would take each panel and put them up on the wall of his home as a story board, like the motion like the movies. And he would replace them and move them around and red them. And that's how he

123
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:10,521
saw it because that's what he was trained to do at Disney.

124
00:17:11,094 --> 00:17:19,875
I thought that was fabulous because it it has the feel of that cartoon. But when he turned the story and they loved it. No edits. I mean, it was you sold us mister Barks

125
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:25,063
Yeah. And and this was, like so crucial for him. Right? This was, like showing

126
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:26,840
showing that he can do this.

127
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:45,461
Mostly on his own. Now. I'm I'm... I have no doubt they trusted his story writing, but they're like we've got this existing story. Let's see what you can do with it art wise. I I like that element where we see the little crow language. This is something we don't get too too much of right where... Right.

128
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,457
We covered another story,

129
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:49,652
pixelated pair where we see

130
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,530
translated

131
00:17:51,347 --> 00:17:51,847
para

132
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:58,684
here we see these crow or or mag vampires or whatever, chatter away like like, human characters.

133
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:06,153
Right? Right? Now that makes it so appealing to certainly the audiences that are reading this and gives it an element of fund. And

134
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:07,627
something else notable

135
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,600
in a lot of these is they feel because they're in the early forties. They're gonna feel much more out of time

136
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,447
compared to a lot of his later stories. Like, a lot of them will have dated elements

137
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:24,036
but this one to me, you know, you see those old time football helmets

138
00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:25,888
just the very concept

139
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:30,882
of the victory garden. But but, yeah, This one feels dated in a way that

140
00:18:31,261 --> 00:19:17,425
that I find very charming. What do you think of his early art His early character design here? Oh, I love it. The angry donald and the throwing donald and the the jumping and leap and and shouting donald his classic. It it it has that comic element in the very last page of him throwing the bag as seated Al the wall. Look at his pose there out of the bed. He's just everything. And then and then the last panel is a classic last shot in a cartoon. He's looking right at the camera, every character that's been in the story is in the store in the panel. And the the crow have the last word. I think it's just a beautiful ending to a funny kinda of rom. Like you said a slaps stick ramp, and that's what what they were doing here. Yeah. That... That's a good sum of that end panel. To me, it feels very abrupt. But as you as you point out, it is like a cartoon.

141
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:31,988
Ending. Awesome good good stuff. We're let's let's get off to the race is warren because we got we got a lot of story to talk about here. So, you know, we've we've just covered his very first ten page story that he was entrusted to do

142
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:37,556
that he was given the chance to adapt we're gonna transition now to the first

143
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:54,146
completely independent story that he did. No no c artist, no written source material, we're gonna get the rabbit foot which is a carl Barks joint. Drawn and and rip. And this is a story

144
00:19:54,524 --> 00:20:11,910
about that old trope of the lucky rabbit foot. Right? The idea that that... It's a little luck token and a good luck charm And, you know, this is kind of before Or is going to have the nephew. You know, Barks sparks is gonna make the Nephews be what he wants them

145
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,430
sometimes they're

146
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:14,830
very rational.

147
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,550
But sometimes they're they're very child like in their

148
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:27,485
love for this kind of belief right. I I I have belief, I believe in it. It's that sort of, like, when you wish upon a star element

149
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:35,335
that Disney, I think in general really like. Right? Rewarding the the faith of kids and and pure heart. So

150
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:38,892
this is a story where the kids are gonna present to Donald

151
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,370
this token

152
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:50,470
that they just got from an old Indian, which is an old trope that hasn't an aged well, but it was a very, very place. If you needed something missed,

153
00:20:51,927 --> 00:21:09,300
you get it from an old Indian back at that time. And Donald is gonna be presented as like the very rational foil in this one who doesn't believe in good luck. But but he is going to overdo it. Right? And it's gonna make him act in a very rash way because

154
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:14,689
the gist of this story is that Donald is gonna set out to prove

155
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:22,455
that their rabbit foot does not bring them luck he is gonna let them put themselves in all kinds of situations

156
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:23,895
that are

157
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:26,227
that are dangerous

158
00:21:26,803 --> 00:21:30,389
that Cps would not approve of. But That's great.

159
00:21:31,385 --> 00:21:38,135
But but every time the Nephews are gonna walk away unscathed. You know, they they're gonna cross a rick bridge

160
00:21:39,075 --> 00:21:39,555
safely.

161
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:43,699
And and he's gonna... He's gonna put poo it as

162
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:51,255
able to hold up an elephant. And, of course, it's gonna collapse under his weight. They're gonna use it to to get a free ride

163
00:21:51,635 --> 00:21:59,864
on a little carnival ride proving him wrong. And then ultimately this story is going to come to its conclusion

164
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:05,870
with something that will see in one of the Donald Duck cartoons and escaped gorilla.

165
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:21,518
Do you remember that? I don't know the name of the cartoon, but I do know that there was a... Yeah. There wasn't an animated cartoon that featured the gorilla. Yeah. And that then the gorilla in this that that escapes from the zoo is like terrifying.

166
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:23,115
Right? Like it's

167
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:36,458
drawn in a very very frightening way as was the one in the cartoon, and I didn't fact check this, but I think that cartoon must have come out first. I believe it did. And and remember the the whole

168
00:22:36,995 --> 00:22:37,495
cinema

169
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:46,935
industry was taken over in nineteen thirty three, ten years earlier by King Kong and and you've got this fascination with Apes and and

170
00:22:47,811 --> 00:23:01,859
Tarzan and movies. So I think Barks just again, just really smart, just knew what would it track the viewers and the readers. Yeah. That that's a really good point. Right? The the country, the world, the pop culture was, like Gorilla crazy.

171
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:14,763
Mighty Joe Young, son of College julian young yep. Yeah. A quick you know, Peru of Google tells me that Mountain Gorillas weren't really discovered by the outside world until nineteen o two.

172
00:23:15,141 --> 00:23:15,500
Wow.

173
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:18,171
It it really struck the popular

174
00:23:18,628 --> 00:23:21,284
imagination for decades there. So

175
00:23:21,662 --> 00:23:27,170
so anyway, the the boys end up using this rabbit foot to avoid harm.

176
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,450
And then Donald will get the bright idea that he's gonna capture

177
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,700
subdue this gorilla with the charm of the rabbit foot the luck of the rabbit foot.

178
00:23:37,477 --> 00:23:40,090
And and he ignores their warnings that's

179
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:44,517
common during their rabbit foot is actually gonna bring him bad luck

180
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,410
And and so

181
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,410
he ends we end this story with him

182
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,170
narrowly escaping

183
00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:53,343
being

184
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,137
killed by the gorilla

185
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:57,707
being rescued by some firefighters.

186
00:23:58,225 --> 00:23:58,725
And

187
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:05,326
and and we get a a good old corporal punishment gag at the end where he's you know, annoyed at the Nephews

188
00:24:05,985 --> 00:24:07,244
threatens to

189
00:24:08,382 --> 00:24:10,020
give him the licking of their lives.

190
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:11,253
And

191
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:15,478
accidentally injure himself bringing the the

192
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:16,054
strap.

193
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:22,435
He and inadvertently injure himself and ends up in the hospital and a full body cast.

194
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,631
Great story. I I I have to point on

195
00:24:26,144 --> 00:24:31,954
a couple of things that I thought of about watching this. I'm going. Wow, this is this is like, what five years,

196
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:35,666
six years before glad Gander and and were

197
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,996
we're playing with that luck theme, and we're having

198
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:47,845
fun with it with the rabbit foot and the three nephews and how determined they are. And how their luck, if you think about it from the bridge and from the

199
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:53,285
the ride at the at the carnival, it all mirrors the kind of Gladstone would have. And

200
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,018
it must have been a successful

201
00:24:55,356 --> 00:24:56,175
trope to

202
00:24:56,553 --> 00:24:58,849
to have Barks continue that on with the character.

203
00:24:59,307 --> 00:25:00,566
Yeah. Totally he's...

204
00:25:01,223 --> 00:25:04,254
He's preoccupied by Al luck. Even early on.

205
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:08,210
I've got a remark again just how, like

206
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:10,547
terrifying the gorilla looks.

207
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:12,460
And lots of panels

208
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,994
that feature the gorilla close ups.

209
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:19,523
For I love the panel in this one that where he's imagining

210
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:20,495
himself

211
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,569
being lauded as a hero

212
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:27,150
in the newspaper says her heroic ducks the do's gorilla and the sub

213
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,196
is not brave, just lucky says modest hero.

214
00:25:32,294 --> 00:25:43,227
I love it. And then look at his eyes in that too. I that's a great panel. On that same page is one of my most the most creative panels and that's where he's shaking the tree branch to the grill is and and Donald

215
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:53,025
word balloons match every shake of the limb. I thought that was really clever. Right. Right. It's great art in there. You know, I like how we just weren't and talked about

216
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:57,785
our specific favorite panels from that one because that's gonna be the way to do this.

217
00:25:58,565 --> 00:26:04,244
Did you have any favorite that we should in retrospective have highlighted in the victory garden?

218
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:07,932
Oh, i I think the the victory garden

219
00:26:08,524 --> 00:26:15,715
I I love... I love the closing panel. I think on the Victory garden on the second page is probably one of my favorite poses for donald.

220
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:20,150
As he says get out of here use sa. I think that's probably one of my favorite

221
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,190
panels that just shows Donald bucket is full, frustrated

222
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:24,990
pan,

223
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:30,720
dull How about you? I I I agree with you. The last one is an easy call.

224
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:34,656
The the one where the nephews peg him with the slingshot pretty great too.

225
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:42,682
Yeah. I think the the the artwork is just getting better and better here. And as he's given free independence on the Rabbit foot story.

226
00:26:43,221 --> 00:26:43,721
He's

227
00:26:44,115 --> 00:26:46,515
And I get I really get the sense that Carl Barks

228
00:26:47,235 --> 00:27:02,162
has these stories up here and he's just wanting to tell them So I really believe and he said in one of these interviews that he never liked working on two stories at the same time. He had to finish one before he began the next one. And so I think he was one of these tireless workers.

229
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:10,848
I don't think it was a nine to five job. It was while he was sleeping while he was walking while he was whatever. He came out and he had these ideas

230
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:12,226
yeah for sure.

231
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:17,980
Alright. I think we're ready to go on to salesman donald.

232
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:24,848
So Barks, I think a third really important story in this series that we're doing is salesman donald

233
00:27:25,786 --> 00:27:26,425
from Walt Disney

234
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:31,534
Number thirty nine and November forty three. I the reason is are many reasons

235
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:33,851
and yet it's sort of the anti

236
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:37,265
of the Rapid foot story. And because

237
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:38,545
we see

238
00:27:38,965 --> 00:27:49,475
the boys needing donald now to go do their thing and the boys are... And and this is really about Donald bragging about being the best salesman ever. And he is

239
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,755
greeting the nephews who

240
00:27:52,135 --> 00:27:55,915
whose whole goal here is to raise enough money to buy

241
00:27:57,588 --> 00:28:01,561
express wagon, but it's probably just a a a boys wagon.

242
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:08,721
Yeah. I'm just picturing a classic radio flyer wagon, but I didn't hear go on that. Yeah. So they're out to sell egg.

243
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:18,315
And they've they've tried and don says. I can do it. I can sell thought the entire neighborhood, I'll sell out. And so kind of counter to Donald

244
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:24,825
success and luck in the past... I mean, it where he's always struggling. He really is successful in this story and he's out

245
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,665
selling these egg beater to the most

246
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:37,151
unlikely people in his neighborhood and there's some great art here then nephews are getting frustrated with his his kind of luck now, you know. And

247
00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:42,533
and I love this because there's so many things happening in this story. You you meet some really interesting characters.

248
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:45,978
Donald persistence and his joy with his

249
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:50,025
incredible skill as a salesman as is seen on almost every page here.

250
00:28:50,758 --> 00:28:51,258
Until

251
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:58,041
something's gotta happen here. And so they get it to the last egg beater and this little shack in their neighborhood where they

252
00:28:58,394 --> 00:28:59,614
they need this feisty

253
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:05,247
hermit, who you don't see right away, but you hear right away, and he's kind of this gl

254
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:06,246
laughing

255
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:13,860
little prank is all I can come up with and and and that's a joy just to watch Donald try to foil him through the door.

256
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:16,535
And and then, of course, we end up

257
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:19,975
seeing him at the end of the story where Donald

258
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:22,135
eventually is successful

259
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:29,087
and sells the hermit the egg beater and the hermit just breaks down and just says, okay, I'll buy it.

260
00:29:29,464 --> 00:29:32,295
But had fun doing it. I just think it's a fun...

261
00:29:32,795 --> 00:29:35,295
One of my early memories a fun

262
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:37,950
story filled with tons of gag

263
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,106
lots of great artwork,

264
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:43,418
the introduction of quirky characters like the Hermit

265
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:46,091
started here. So yeah, that's

266
00:29:46,404 --> 00:29:49,898
that's salesman donald, I think is just a lot of fun. How about you?

267
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:56,857
Warren I'm I'm so glad that you picked this one or for a couple of reasons this was your choice.

268
00:29:57,554 --> 00:30:12,100
You know, I asked you to throw in another that you really cared about in this era that we're talking about this forty forty three. Right? Forty three Yeah Where's still forty three here. Yeah. Yep. And and I wanted to limit this from forty three to forty five

269
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:16,895
This is a new experience for me because I had never read this one.

270
00:30:17,354 --> 00:30:24,496
Okay I think I've read a good ninety five percent of his output I've... I've missed a couple of dozen here and there

271
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:28,683
but this is my first time talking about a story on the podcast

272
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:33,841
that I I read the previous day. And this one was so much fun

273
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:38,342
and and it's so tight and I I loved the hermit

274
00:30:38,935 --> 00:30:39,055
Right?

275
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:51,095
It's it's the genesis of these other goofy characters that Donald gonna try to sell to in, like, land of the tote pulls. Yep. And at least a couple of others.

276
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:51,854
Right.

277
00:30:52,731 --> 00:31:01,399
It's it's the idea of trying to sell a gadget that you don't need to someone like that is is inherently funny. Right?

278
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:06,404
And then the tight setup he does were Donald Vows at the very beginning

279
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,720
to sell

280
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:15,799
only to people on his block gives him that limitation, right, that sets up why he's gonna be so dogg

281
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:18,915
about trying to sell Al an egg beater

282
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,370
to to a hermit that just hates people

283
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:27,770
doesn't cook for himself. I think it references he only eats, like, roots and herbs or something

284
00:31:28,164 --> 00:31:40,910
I think he's a vegetarian. Yeah. Mh. And the... It's it's a good procedure to all of the little, like, over the top battles of will and battles of wit

285
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,150
that

286
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,383
he's gonna have Donald go into against Gladstone

287
00:31:46,502 --> 00:31:48,160
against neighbor jones.

288
00:31:49,456 --> 00:31:56,755
Sometimes against sc and and other people. It's it's like it feels like the the birth of all of those.

289
00:31:57,133 --> 00:32:16,510
Gladstone said that because I I agree with that. And I think it's also this battle of of wit and will with his nephews. I mean, if you think about it, he's trying to up one up his nephews in here they've gone through the neighborhood. They need the money. And he goes, I'll solve them to the same people You tried. I mean, he's he's he's childish,

290
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:17,747
but he's also

291
00:32:18,445 --> 00:32:29,056
so confident that he can do this. This is the the donald we see grow out of this story here. And we're still in forty three. We're still the same first year. I I love the

292
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,984
I love the disgust that they give him when he like flatter and flirt

293
00:32:34,403 --> 00:32:48,720
Al housewife life at the very beginning of it. Yeah. You love the hard on that page too and he his eyes or lifted up and he goes well I'm afraid. I you won't be interested in the humble kitchen gadget. I'm selling like your hands are too delicate for beating eggs.

294
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:49,720
Right.

295
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,040
Yeah. He's so

296
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,040
recognizing. And and we don't really get that that's a characterization that he's gonna

297
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:11,474
he's gonna abandon. But but it's a fun little ben. Yep. Yeah. Any any other... Any anything else you wanna highlight from this this really really cool early story. I'm so glad that you picked this one. Oh, thanks. And I and i I think one of the early

298
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:18,445
examples of a repeated art technique that he used here and he may have used it a few times before was the silhouette

299
00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:22,100
when when the boys and and donald are walking down the street

300
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:26,869
And and it's just a it's a great way to break up to art in the story.

301
00:33:28,186 --> 00:33:37,192
The little side panels and and just a little just the visual gag are just great when the hermit shoots ink at him through the the key,

302
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:38,440
that little

303
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:44,060
very interesting panel of Donald just looking at the camera and looking straight ahead rather.

304
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:55,509
And when he says that's an insult. You don't see many panels like that. Yeah. It definitely feels like very cartoon influenced. Yep. So I think Barks had just Al blast with this one with all the gag. Definitely.

305
00:33:55,927 --> 00:34:01,614
I've got... I've gotta mention how great the bit with the different doors is. Yeah. The rubber door

306
00:34:02,765 --> 00:34:08,219
the layer of doors to... He has all these trick doors that can only have been designed

307
00:34:08,598 --> 00:34:10,297
for this kind of battle.

308
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:23,145
Right? So and and he kind of gives it away at the end that he's like annoyed that he lost, but it's the most fun that the hermit ever had. So so he's clearly been waiting for for this kind of

309
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:29,085
test of of wits to come along. What do you think of the hermit? Oh, oh, he's hilarious.

310
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,120
He

311
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,240
his his wild over the top bush.

312
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,280
Barks does that with, like, herman and the hermit.

313
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:38,255
In another story.

314
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:48,950
I I didn't know there was a precursor to him. So he... He's he's awesome. He's hilarious. And I think what you like about him, what what finds him charming is that he's constantly giggling,

315
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:59,664
and he's constantly laughing as if he's just enjoying this and you didn't mind buying the egg beater because he had fun. And to me that just it just makes the story that much more pleasing and of course

316
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,789
that they're asking for more money at the end and Donald

317
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:06,220
again is after them this time with a with a branch

318
00:35:07,436 --> 00:35:17,080
you liked it. Yeah. And and you know, made me think of how much the early in mid twentieth century did this thing too where, like, kids

319
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:26,471
Kids got on the hook for these kind of like low grade salesman jobs all the time. Right? Looking through the old Dow and gold key

320
00:35:27,184 --> 00:35:31,156
comics, there all these schemes to get kids to sell seeds

321
00:35:31,654 --> 00:35:32,154
and

322
00:35:32,492 --> 00:35:35,387
and and other stuff for prizes and they inevitably

323
00:35:36,098 --> 00:35:39,885
resulted in parents having to buy their stock off them.

324
00:35:40,602 --> 00:35:43,551
That's right. Alright. So I'm rolling along,

325
00:35:44,165 --> 00:35:45,544
we are at

326
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:48,880
my favorite of of the bunch of them,

327
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:52,556
which is the Ducktales the iron pants.

328
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:53,710
And

329
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:56,027
this is such a highlight

330
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,703
to me of of his early

331
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,080
era comics.

332
00:36:00,694 --> 00:36:03,987
I read most of these stories in glad tones

333
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:05,782
comp their

334
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:12,382
their album that collected a bunch of them. And they gave this one the title. It's called the Ducktales the Iron pants.

335
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,397
They they put Barks

336
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:17,390
great oil is this an oil or Lit.

337
00:36:18,124 --> 00:36:27,336
It it was an oil first then became a lit though. I have it. I have the small though. It's a smaller lit. It's just great with the nephew torch donald. Oh, yeah.

338
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,810
Just a wonderful

339
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:32,130
image, a wonderful painting

340
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:35,610
of donald attacking the boys snow

341
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,383
in full suit of armor.

342
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,973
He doesn't get to do a lot of these more gag based

343
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:48,754
oils, you know, a lot of them are more like the adventure or the kind of slice of life Ducktales

344
00:36:48,954 --> 00:36:49,454
stories.

345
00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:53,443
I can only think of like this true officer Donald.

346
00:36:54,355 --> 00:37:07,443
Sure there's a couple others. But this one kinda stands apart. This is such a great great painting. And but anyway, the story is is awesome. This is one of the best Donald versus the nephews,

347
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:08,897
ten pager.

348
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:10,651
I I think ever.

349
00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:14,882
Despite being from this very, very early period.

350
00:37:15,221 --> 00:37:15,341
Right?

351
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:22,165
It has the nephews playing outside, having some Good old fashioned wholesome snow.

352
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:23,441
Donald

353
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:29,515
decides to walk by them. He's clearly goa them. He's clearly setting them up

354
00:37:30,054 --> 00:37:30,554
to

355
00:37:31,052 --> 00:37:38,177
get in in this kind of battle with them because he he's gonna engage in that that trope, which

356
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:42,350
doesn't exist any longer. But I think the idea in the

357
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:51,445
the middle of the twentieth century was that a man wearing a top hat was just begging to have it knocked off by a snowball.

358
00:37:52,345 --> 00:37:55,725
So so Donald ins this big

359
00:37:56,026 --> 00:38:08,376
snow war with the nephews by walking by them in a top hat and he's sabotage it. He's a fixed it with an elastic band and he's stationed a big snowball ball,

360
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:12,031
which he uses to cave in the trench that they're in

361
00:38:12,729 --> 00:38:18,333
where did that... Did that bit remind you on comfortably of the Trench warfare from just a couple

362
00:38:19,149 --> 00:38:21,702
years a couple decades or or before this?

363
00:38:22,475 --> 00:38:26,770
I didn't see that. That's an interesting take on it, though with the boys in the trench and getting

364
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:34,449
bombed if you will. But yeah. I mean, we're we're only twenty years away from World War one and... I only thought about it this time.

365
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:42,082
Okay. But... But the this has. And the f used to decide they have to answer back. So they're gonna build this cool snow.

366
00:38:43,017 --> 00:38:47,761
And when Donald comes back, trying the same trick you know, right,

367
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:49,620
which he should know better.

368
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:59,684
They escalate things by breaking an egg in his top hat, which which sets him off and he invades their snow.

369
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:03,691
But but they had all this time to prepare now. And so

370
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:06,086
they are hitting him with all these

371
00:39:06,624 --> 00:39:08,201
great snow trips

372
00:39:08,778 --> 00:39:24,488
that really fired my imagination Al as a kid. You know, I see this little snowball ga gun that they're attacking him with or this little this little rico bit or what do what do you call the little weapon that they use That's some

373
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:41,385
two heavy objects t to Al align. There's a name. I can't i know. I don't know what that is. Yeah. We're finding errors. But, you know, they they wrap him with a couple of snowball around a line and they they get him good.

374
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:49,735
And they they realized that they may have overs shot. Right? Because he heads into his workshop with a vengeance.

375
00:39:50,235 --> 00:39:51,255
And we've got these

376
00:39:52,235 --> 00:39:55,696
we've got these, like actions where the nephews are

377
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,829
preparing their defenses

378
00:39:58,168 --> 00:39:59,627
s up their snow.

379
00:40:00,685 --> 00:40:07,156
And and Donald is doing some unseen escalating. And when he finally emerges,

380
00:40:07,776 --> 00:40:08,476
it is

381
00:40:08,936 --> 00:40:11,136
such an amazing panel warren.

382
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:12,916
He is wearing

383
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:19,323
a suit of armor that he's black smoothed up in his workshop. It it it's

384
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:27,680
suited for a Ducktales it's got his bill. He's got... It's... you know, it fits his bill. He's holding a sword.

385
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:31,566
And he he comes out ready to invade

386
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:34,241
invade them.

387
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:41,578
And and they're just trying every trick that they've got. To repel him, but because he's armored.

388
00:40:42,615 --> 00:40:50,750
They they can't stop him and they they start to throw tools and rocks at him and eventually he's able to

389
00:40:51,566 --> 00:40:53,582
approach their wall and

390
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:55,514
slice a

391
00:40:56,013 --> 00:41:02,106
and and slice square out of it with this sword. And I love the

392
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,095
word balloon where he is just going so over the top threatening yeah.

393
00:41:07,934 --> 00:41:08,774
He calls out.

394
00:41:09,493 --> 00:41:12,965
Nothing can save you from me. I am invincible.

395
00:41:13,463 --> 00:41:15,441
I am doom itself.

396
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:18,637
This one is a masterpiece.

397
00:41:19,471 --> 00:41:20,531
They finally

398
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:26,191
resort to a little bit of cartoon logic where they they've got this flame through.

399
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:27,164
Cook.

400
00:41:27,844 --> 00:41:30,860
A trio of brothers with with the flames hour yes

401
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:33,630
that they've used to kind of melt and then

402
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:44,015
solidify the walls of their fort. They get one of them gets the bright idea to burrow and the snow behind Donald and ultimately heats him heats his suit of armor up,

403
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:49,116
you know, and and do they do manage to heat it up enough to repel him?

404
00:41:49,729 --> 00:41:51,345
And and it concludes

405
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:52,620
with Donald

406
00:41:53,076 --> 00:41:55,848
tending to his wounds on a large block of ice

407
00:41:56,503 --> 00:42:03,056
as the ne fuse are getting ready to hole up for the winter, and they've they've have turned the armor into

408
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:04,136
a radiator

409
00:42:04,515 --> 00:42:05,736
s and are roasting

410
00:42:06,249 --> 00:42:07,307
roasting wiener.

411
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:13,804
Warren this is such a great bit of of wish fulfillment and and

412
00:42:14,676 --> 00:42:17,776
kid empowerment and Donald versus the Nephews

413
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:19,576
slaps stick violence

414
00:42:20,076 --> 00:42:39,531
i I don't mean to i I've... I'm big footing here. I'm talking too much about this one. But but this this is like the story that I was like, oh i I gotta talk about some of these classic ones because I don't wanna miss talking about the Ducktales the iron pants. Well, I like this story a lot, and and thank you for

415
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:49,336
for your passion about it. I remember this one as well. Not as well as as salesman donald, but I I I do have the lit graph

416
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:58,266
that to me just makes me laugh every time I walk by it in my room and look at it. And just I just love it. You said it it... It's classic donald versus an Nephews.

417
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,337
What I really like what Barks is doing here is that first

418
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,154
reveal of the Ducktales.

419
00:43:04,753 --> 00:43:15,586
It it's a laugh out loud panel. I mean, and the duck in the armor says very little. He just keeps storming the castle and and but... There's a couple of Huey, elements I love

420
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,777
he not only fashioned this out of the Gladstone

421
00:43:18,857 --> 00:43:21,095
company where he got the armor from.

422
00:43:21,694 --> 00:43:23,453
But he put a little plume on his head.

423
00:43:24,132 --> 00:43:30,312
Armor. I mean this he went over the top, I mean, it's but great art, great characterization

424
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:34,956
invent of, but that those panels when he is introduced with the sn,

425
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,824
all the way through to that declaration

426
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:45,534
of I am doing itself. He doesn't say much Al all, I think he just says one little line is he's coming out he goes whole var

427
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:47,568
think of the thy buff

428
00:43:48,066 --> 00:43:49,143
can stop me now.

429
00:43:49,782 --> 00:43:59,082
That's what cracked me up so much about this story. Yeah. Yeah. Well said. And and you're right about that awesome touch where you can see the logo of the stove company

430
00:43:59,621 --> 00:44:06,461
on that he he's, like, turned in a boiler or something into it. Al little little foreshadowing there too to the last panel.

431
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:12,530
Right. And and you're right. He's just like this this unstoppable, like, sort of juggernaut or not men

432
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,290
slowly men

433
00:44:14,671 --> 00:44:27,069
his way towards them. Yeah. Yeah. This one's a ton of fun. It looks like we are ready to talk about our last one. So I'm I'm glad to close out this one by talking about Mad Chemist.

434
00:44:28,086 --> 00:44:29,743
I think this one is really

435
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:34,613
really interesting and really fun. And I remember reading about it in

436
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:36,105
a

437
00:44:36,442 --> 00:44:42,807
issue that Glad put out where they paired it with the sunken yacht because they both had like these little elements

438
00:44:43,721 --> 00:44:44,741
where the...

439
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:59,476
There was a little bit of, like, real life that kind bleed it and bled into it. So, you know, I'll let I'll let you summarize the story here and then I'll kinda talk about the little feature that they'd published in that comic on it. Yeah. Yeah. And again,

440
00:45:00,411 --> 00:45:11,385
the this particular one Barks, I believe comes from Walt Disney comics and stories number forty four. Yeah. That's the one. And what I like about this story,

441
00:45:12,005 --> 00:45:15,025
and it again, it's just a newer one to me, but when I read it,

442
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:22,280
I just love the way again, the Nephews and Donald playoff each other. Anyway, we see the nephews and their they're playing in their

443
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,365
their chemistry set and and donald is really interested in what they're doing

444
00:45:28,538 --> 00:45:38,280
and says, hey ought he he take some of the chemicals and he's says you ought to just add this and they really warn him. They'll be careful. Something horrible could happen a good blow up and he goes

445
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,120
fu.

446
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:49,047
And so he pours is it in the cylinder bowl that the chemicals are bubbling in flies up in the air hits down on the head, and all of a sudden Battle has this incredible

447
00:45:49,386 --> 00:45:49,886
transformation

448
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:56,167
into a brilliant chemist. He he looks the same. He's walking kind of days. He's got a huge

449
00:45:56,745 --> 00:45:57,843
bump on his head.

450
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:03,522
But he starts talking very in very scientific kind of funny terms. And he

451
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,197
says we've got to

452
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:08,547
kinda taking me seriously here. I'm gonna con talk something

453
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:12,270
And he says I'm gonna be the mighty is chemist in the universe.

454
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:14,703
So he creates this

455
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:21,741
con that he proudly announces as Duck might Yeah. Doc is Al explosive chemical that he

456
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:36,078
has has developed, but it's dangerous. So we have to drive far away from Duck to experiment with it. So the boys say well we just do it here in the backyard. No. No Too dangerous, so they go out and but they get outside of Duck and they

457
00:46:36,496 --> 00:46:40,749
ideally over a cliff and battle begins dropping these

458
00:46:41,286 --> 00:46:41,685
bottles.

459
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,835
Of Ducktales mite over this

460
00:46:44,172 --> 00:46:52,505
one thousand foot high cliff and says be careful it'll explode. While he does this over and over again at different sizes and nothing happens.

461
00:46:52,885 --> 00:47:01,754
So he goes down to the bottom lights match looks in there, and then it just blows up. But instead of being hurt, he's proud that he has

462
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,263
created this incredible potion.

463
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:05,538
And so

464
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:12,030
they go back off and they pour a little bit of this in the car for gas and it speeds down the road.

465
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:24,469
They all say good goodbye cruel world, which is just fun. So after they're they're splash in the water from the car that with the with the Ducktales in it goes into the water. Donald is now absolutely

466
00:47:25,046 --> 00:47:32,195
convinced that he can send a rocket to the moon. The boys get concerned and they go see a doctor called you doctor You quirk, a brain expert

467
00:47:32,575 --> 00:47:33,435
and he basically

468
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:37,649
explains to the doctor that they're worried that this

469
00:47:38,186 --> 00:47:40,800
Ducktales might is going to cause more problems

470
00:47:41,217 --> 00:47:57,256
and that he's built a rocket ship to fly to the moon. So the doctor just basically gets up. And said so what he can't harm any anything there. So they go home, donald got the rocket ship built. So the boys show up and Donald was already in his rocket. And he's ready to take off and he

471
00:47:57,594 --> 00:48:10,390
he roar off the the boys tri lasso him to stay put, but he goes all the way of the space. He goes all the way and he's extremely startled now he goes around the moon and he heads right back to Earth and he crashes

472
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:20,423
believe it or not in his own backyard. And when he is told that he has done this incredible achievement, he doesn't believe it. I think his his his little Amnesia or his literally

473
00:48:20,802 --> 00:48:33,462
personality shift to the man the Mad chemist comes back around, and he says, I can't believe it went around the moon. And everybody's proud of this accomplishment and they asking him if he could mix up some more duck might. And now it doesn't even know what Ducktales is. Right. So

474
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:39,101
that's that's the kind of the end of the story either. Yeah. It's a a perfect... One one of those

475
00:48:39,439 --> 00:48:41,853
first sort of etch sketch stories

476
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:43,648
where there's something

477
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:47,212
that's, like, really over the top, he literally

478
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:48,648
leaves Earth

479
00:48:49,424 --> 00:49:04,486
and then Barks is gonna have to kind of reset it back to the status quo. I really like this one. This one stood out to me because it feels like the art... It's it's still very early. But the art feels like it's really starting to mature

480
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,723
by now in this.

481
00:49:07,302 --> 00:49:19,289
Yeah. I agree. Race to moon. I mean, there's other stories that come later that pick up on this great early artwork. Yeah. And this one, you know, it it's kind of evo of the fire bug,

482
00:49:19,907 --> 00:49:20,847
which is another

483
00:49:21,306 --> 00:49:26,816
kind of early not quite as early I think, but her early ish favorite of mine where he gets some kind of

484
00:49:27,553 --> 00:49:30,245
insult to the head that changes his personality.

485
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:34,908
But I really like the look that he's given when when he's kind of

486
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,158
in this other guys as the mad chemist.

487
00:49:38,657 --> 00:49:42,713
This one's really cool to that sort of escalation of the action

488
00:49:43,172 --> 00:49:44,806
where they're driving out to

489
00:49:45,305 --> 00:49:47,443
ever increasing vacant lots

490
00:49:48,262 --> 00:49:50,959
until they just get get out deep into the wilderness

491
00:49:51,818 --> 00:49:59,454
to to to blow up his weapon. And it's hard not to think for me about the Manhattan project.

492
00:49:59,933 --> 00:50:02,307
Right? This one feels like such an allegory

493
00:50:03,602 --> 00:50:04,102
because

494
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:08,087
What are we in with this? One is this nineteen forty four?

495
00:50:08,686 --> 00:50:11,301
Where are we in in relationship with

496
00:50:11,998 --> 00:50:12,658
so this

497
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:18,580
came out in May of nineteen forty four, that's the date on wikipedia. And

498
00:50:19,038 --> 00:50:19,538
the

499
00:50:20,036 --> 00:50:22,726
atom bomb mind the giveaway. Well,

500
00:50:23,526 --> 00:50:24,986
the the real one,

501
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:26,226
fat

502
00:50:28,606 --> 00:50:31,286
that that was detonated in forty five.

503
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,639
So you're.

504
00:50:33,057 --> 00:50:36,949
But everyone, like, this was something that everyone

505
00:50:37,806 --> 00:50:40,515
kind of knew was going on but.

506
00:50:41,651 --> 00:50:45,183
There was clearly this race, Right, going on. No one...

507
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,982
Civilians didn't know the specific of it. But they had an idea that both sides were working on these

508
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,751
these super weapons. So this was on everyone's mind.

509
00:50:56,644 --> 00:50:58,420
And and there's this like really

510
00:50:58,797 --> 00:50:59,736
kind of frightening

511
00:51:00,073 --> 00:51:09,162
undertone with this one. I Well no question about it. Yes. Some evil undertone. I mean Oppenheimer was worked on the atom bottom for us. Is that correct? And yes.

512
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:10,677
Yes. Exactly.

513
00:51:11,254 --> 00:51:15,002
And this one has also this really interesting, like,

514
00:51:15,736 --> 00:51:17,236
sort of true life

515
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,176
component of it.

516
00:51:18,896 --> 00:51:20,356
I don't fully

517
00:51:20,736 --> 00:51:21,996
understand it, but

518
00:51:22,376 --> 00:51:22,876
apparently,

519
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:28,026
some of the chemistry work that Barks depicted at the beginning of this,

520
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:30,884
actually was like, pretty realistic

521
00:51:31,263 --> 00:51:36,966
and and was was ahead of it time. You can find a couple of articles online about this,

522
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:51,591
kind of under the the heading of Did donald Duck accidentally use meth and a comic before it was discovered, the the studio got this article from these readers these scientists who were also big fans.

523
00:51:52,126 --> 00:51:54,106
Of the dot comics that we're...

524
00:51:54,526 --> 00:51:56,266
I'll just read read this

525
00:51:56,886 --> 00:51:57,566
verbatim yeah.

526
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,306
They got this

527
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:04,868
letter from a doctorate from Joseph b Lambert of the California institute of Technology.

528
00:52:05,246 --> 00:52:10,865
He he's pointing out a reference in a technical article called the spin states of carb.

529
00:52:11,442 --> 00:52:37,525
And he says that despite the recent extensive interest in meth chemistry much additional study is required. Among the experiments which have not to our knowledge been carried out Al yet. Is one of a most intriguing nature suggested in the literature of no less than nineteen years ago, and the footnote in that technical paper directed readers to issue forty four of walt Disney's comics and stories.

530
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,405
And and he he goes on to say that Donald referenced to c

531
00:52:42,782 --> 00:52:43,282
two

532
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:47,030
in panel two point one was years ahead of its time

533
00:52:47,726 --> 00:52:50,618
as the existence of that elusive chemical

534
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:54,579
had not been that chemical in media had not been proven

535
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:59,575
as of nineteen forty four. This is like that very right academic

536
00:52:59,954 --> 00:53:10,450
language that that scientists or followers use when they're kind of being a little bit on the nose a little bit funny. The inclusion of this footage in a quite scholar article,

537
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:18,710
stemmed from the discovery that doctor. Gasp Barks and i share a mutual and independently Gladstone standing esteem for the adventures of Donald Duck,

538
00:53:20,645 --> 00:53:25,725
It was love it. It was doctor Gasp who rediscovered this early mention of Carb.

539
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:26,840
So

540
00:53:27,299 --> 00:53:30,556
there's there's a lot of reasons to appreciate this one.

541
00:53:30,895 --> 00:53:34,970
I think it's... I do think it's one of the best of the early stories.

542
00:53:35,624 --> 00:53:36,124
But...

543
00:53:36,502 --> 00:53:39,156
But I also think that that that little technical

544
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:40,592
detail

545
00:53:41,169 --> 00:53:50,155
merits highlighting here Oh, that... That's great. That thank you for sharing that. I was unaware of that. But it it shows that Donald Ducktales popularity is spread across

546
00:53:50,615 --> 00:53:51,554
so many different

547
00:53:52,013 --> 00:53:58,267
generations and different different professions. Right? And I also like the notion that that we're not the only

548
00:53:58,926 --> 00:54:07,431
prone men here who still like duck comics. Right? This this was several decades ago and these these various esteem scientists

549
00:54:08,105 --> 00:54:16,077
So I I like that. Any any other comments on this one, the Mad chemist warren? Well, again, it was a newer story for me

550
00:54:16,496 --> 00:54:17,170
looking at it

551
00:54:17,869 --> 00:54:19,326
in the issue that I have.

552
00:54:19,744 --> 00:54:22,997
I'm just... I'm taken by the artwork and how much more

553
00:54:23,334 --> 00:54:24,965
art is experimenting with

554
00:54:25,545 --> 00:54:36,731
outside of this world and looking at the moon, but the moon might look like just so many great little little gag. Yeah. I'm gonna have to dig into this one a little bit more and... Yeah. This one's a lot of fun. So

555
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:45,375
warren, I I wanna s size just a little bit. We can kinda wrap things up by by talking about by kinda reflecting on this period,

556
00:54:45,755 --> 00:54:50,869
I love going back and looking at these. I still think they're Barks in his most formative

557
00:54:51,408 --> 00:54:55,264
time. I mean, I mean, he's he's be coming the storyteller and artist that he...

558
00:54:55,842 --> 00:55:01,068
He's he's good. He's not great yet. But he's he's good and he knows it. And

559
00:55:01,605 --> 00:55:16,845
again, I just think it's wonderful. How much freedom the editors gave him to do these. Yeah, He's really getting some great confidence from doing these. And like it was kind of it was really unique what he got to do. Right? Like the the Disney comics,

560
00:55:18,665 --> 00:55:25,453
the Ducktales stories that he was doing about. Right? Like I don't think there were other creators

561
00:55:26,388 --> 00:55:28,484
around this time who are

562
00:55:28,821 --> 00:55:32,330
being given this opportunity. Am I am I right for the comics?

563
00:55:32,825 --> 00:55:40,525
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. No. He was it. That was it at the time. I I think there we had the different cover artists. Often they

564
00:55:40,905 --> 00:55:41,385
competitors.

565
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,808
Up until issue number thirty one, the victory garden. They were reprint newspaper

566
00:55:47,146 --> 00:55:54,520
comic strips and they ran them ran out. They they said we're done. We have to do something else and that that desperation to find new content

567
00:55:54,937 --> 00:55:58,387
for this Walt Disney comics and stories format this monthly format

568
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:02,580
This was a great career starter for for Carl Marx,

569
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:08,135
because they couldn't reprint any more newspaper strips. He he really was

570
00:56:08,554 --> 00:56:09,613
Disney comics

571
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:14,262
for for a long time. I mean we had those newspapers for twenty three year career. Yeah.

572
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,797
We had those newspaper classics

573
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:23,793
We have the great Got for and Mickey mouse comics that'll be collected over and over the the like Talia

574
00:56:24,905 --> 00:56:30,339
Mh trips and and others the art Taliaferro the the comic strip is right.

575
00:56:31,018 --> 00:56:34,770
Right. He kept walt Disney's comics and stories going,

576
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,450
he set the template.

577
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,770
The the series, he was writing them

578
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:50,296
monthly for for so long that it's safe to say that, like, the the comics line wouldn't have likely gone on and become as enduring without him.

579
00:56:51,387 --> 00:56:53,657
Let alone the Donald Ducktales

580
00:56:53,697 --> 00:56:57,202
line, you know, that's gonna get spun off. And then uncle Scrooge

581
00:56:57,935 --> 00:57:00,315
Right? That's gonna become his his own

582
00:57:01,135 --> 00:57:05,535
his own... It might as well have been called Carl Barks uncle Scrooge.

583
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:09,221
Because it wasn't a monthly title at first. No.

584
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:30,731
Not to begin with and all the four color long form stories. I mean, we know that the greek fifth the Victory garden came in early forty three shortly after finds pirate gold give him his break But when did the mum ring the next long form story? When was that published? That that was September of forty three. So he gets to do about a half dozen

585
00:57:31,684 --> 00:57:32,664
of the

586
00:57:33,442 --> 00:57:34,622
of the ten pager

587
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,870
before he gets to do. That that one, of course is very significant as his first

588
00:57:41,328 --> 00:57:41,828
independent

589
00:57:42,206 --> 00:57:48,991
full length adventure story. Right. So Disney had him doing the full length stories to to fall into the four color format.

590
00:57:49,404 --> 00:57:51,139
To do those. He did these monthly.

591
00:57:51,874 --> 00:57:56,118
Know he's very productive. He was a busy artist and the busy writer to be given all the freedom

592
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:05,671
to tell all of these stories that he wanted to tell is a great benefit for the readers and for for you and me. You even if he himself didn't feel

593
00:58:06,026 --> 00:58:11,205
as free sometimes to tell some of the stories that he liked. We we didn't cover

594
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:22,931
lifeguard days is in this early period. And that's the one where he was forced to to reduce the bo of a of a duck bathing beauty character. One of his early

595
00:58:23,365 --> 00:58:25,544
bout of of being censored.

596
00:58:26,442 --> 00:58:37,536
We didn't that of here. It it's a it's a duck. So it's Al duck. It's a dock with b size pretty it's a little bit disturbing, but ultimately, he did have to, like, flatten

597
00:58:37,992 --> 00:58:41,061
reduce her her chest to get past the editors.

598
00:58:42,154 --> 00:58:55,691
We didn't get Al about neighbor, good neighbors. Right? We've got our first iteration of, like, neighbor Jump and he he uses a couple different versions of neighbor jones. Mh. So the... These were never like as a kid

599
00:58:56,045 --> 00:58:58,261
I didn't like these as much

600
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:02,931
because they felt very primitive. I didn't really have an

601
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:03,769
appreciation

602
00:59:04,147 --> 00:59:04,821
of his

603
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:21,317
his career arc. And then also, you know, I didn't read them in that kind of order or anything naturally. I I I read a bunch of these for the first time in the glad graphic novel, which was number twenty seven in that series

604
00:59:21,911 --> 00:59:34,942
So, you know, I didn't inherently appreciate it. I I figured out, oh these are his first stories. That's interesting. But they weren't ones that I went back too. I probably only read the duck in the iron pants

605
00:59:35,441 --> 00:59:37,060
two or three dozen times

606
00:59:37,479 --> 00:59:39,996
compared to some of the stories that I read.

607
00:59:40,691 --> 00:59:41,791
Scores of times,

608
00:59:42,531 --> 00:59:45,671
which is to say, I do... I do love these stories, but,

609
00:59:46,451 --> 00:59:52,766
you know, more as an appreciation of what they say about. Where he was in his career at the time.

610
00:59:53,386 --> 00:59:55,246
Right? I do wanna mention

611
00:59:55,546 --> 00:59:56,046
where

612
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,216
these stories kind of fall as far as the community.

613
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:04,565
Right? So I I love to check them out on Ducktales.

614
01:00:04,604 --> 01:00:05,423
And I'm gonna

615
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:10,690
I'm gonna talk about them. Let's talk about them in order of lowest first.

616
01:00:11,147 --> 01:00:18,093
So So the victory garden. Right? That this one clocks in pretty low. This one has a six point nine

617
01:00:18,472 --> 01:00:19,531
out of ten

618
01:00:19,885 --> 01:00:21,662
which puts it as

619
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:22,580
number

620
01:00:23,198 --> 01:00:24,417
thirty seven

621
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:25,255
thousand

622
01:00:26,152 --> 01:00:29,047
and some out of the forty one thousand

623
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:48,456
some stories very low for a Barks story. And and obviously it wasn't written by by him. In fact, I I forgot to mention this, we don't know who wrote it. Like we don't know We know that that was handed over to him by the editor, but we don't know he scripted it. Correct. Written by anonymous studio

624
01:00:48,851 --> 01:00:49,351
basically.

625
01:00:50,371 --> 01:01:00,761
Or anonymous publishing hack. Like it's it's a fine story, but it's it's very thread there. But that's interesting to me. That seems a little bit unfair when you consider

626
01:01:01,899 --> 01:01:09,211
you how, how significant of a story. But but taken as its own story. Yeah. It's it's not the best. Yeah. And then

627
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:18,685
next, the the next highest one is the Rabbit split. Which jumps up quite Al bit. So we've got a seven point one out of ten, good for

628
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,159
one thousand

629
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:38,676
seven hundred and forty fourth out of all forty one at some thousand that did jump up quite a bit just that six point nine to seven point one, it leaked up quite a bit. Right. That was his first full original story. So Exactly. Clearly, it landed much better in in the community as as a

630
01:01:39,191 --> 01:01:40,231
purely Carl Barks

631
01:01:40,711 --> 01:01:43,371
story. Yeah. Good to know. And then

632
01:01:43,711 --> 01:01:52,619
salesman Donald is next. That gets to seven point two out of ten. And it's it's into the top thousand. It's ranked nine hundred and seventeen

633
01:01:53,038 --> 01:01:54,337
out of forty one something.

634
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:59,661
And then we've got the mad chemist, that one ranks quite highly for

635
01:02:01,197 --> 01:02:11,667
an old one It's seven point five out of ten. Good for three hundred and twenty six. I do think that one might get a little bit inflation just because of the, like,

636
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:14,296
this the ones that kind of

637
01:02:14,753 --> 01:02:27,406
bleed out into the pop culture, people remember them better. So I think they've vote on hire. But but I do think it's a very good old story. And and then the Ducktales the iron pants is the clear winner

638
01:02:28,226 --> 01:02:28,866
Al ranger.

639
01:02:29,561 --> 01:02:34,581
Two hundred and ninety one out of forty one thousand, some

640
01:02:35,121 --> 01:02:37,361
good for seven point five again out of ten.

641
01:02:38,493 --> 01:02:48,501
I would agree with that one being probably the top story in terms of story. And and and I I I might personally I might swap the index ratings for

642
01:02:49,001 --> 01:03:14,005
salesman donald and the Mad chemist. I I wasn't as crazy by the mad chemist. But again, you're right. I think it captured the imagination of the world at that time and That's that's very fair. I am... I I was really impressed by how good that sales donald was. I I enjoyed that one Al lot. I was blind. To could read that from the hours. That's I think I think of my favorite of all of them today. Nice. And and I just I love the duck in iron pants.

643
01:03:14,505 --> 01:03:29,356
Oh, yeah. So much. I I think he's just you can you can really feel... I think he's doing what really entertained him in that one because it's it's so over the top. Alright. Well, this was fine. Yeah. So much.

644
01:03:29,736 --> 01:03:38,527
I agree. This was great more and this this this is a lot of fun. It's it's fun to take this meet complimentary group of stories from the same era,

645
01:03:39,266 --> 01:03:48,296
get to cover them. I'm I'm not planning to cover any more of the old ones. So this this is gonna be our stand in for all of these.

646
01:03:48,636 --> 01:03:53,156
Thank you so much for for taking the time to appreciate these early Barks.

647
01:03:53,811 --> 01:03:55,631
Always great to revisit these stories.

648
01:03:56,051 --> 01:04:09,838
I love it and looking forward to our next opportunity. Awesome. I I'd love to hear what listeners think about, you know, their their own preference for these stories or if there's one that they really think that we should have covered

649
01:04:10,496 --> 01:04:18,168
in this early period. Feel free to reach out at Barks remarks at g dot com or on the Barks remarks, Facebook page,

650
01:04:18,727 --> 01:04:20,242
and until next time.
