2
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:54,600
Hello, and welcome back to Barks remarks. I'm Mark Sever. This time podcasting

3
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:57,764
from inside a tiny closet hopefully,

4
00:00:58,222 --> 00:01:07,236
I get some good quality sound out of that. I have a returning guest host with me today. If you can introduce yourself, Hi. I'm Sarah Santiago.

5
00:01:07,573 --> 00:01:08,711
I'm currently

6
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:09,867
broadcasting

7
00:01:10,244 --> 00:01:12,418
from my bedroom in

8
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:14,053
Thunder Scotland.

9
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,145
Yeah sla, which is

10
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:21,705
perfect for the story that we're gonna be talking about today. We get to talk about

11
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,960
fan favorite, the old castle secret. I'm very excited for this one. This is pretty landmark

12
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:34,364
story, and I'm glad to get you back to do this one because neither

13
00:01:34,782 --> 00:01:39,369
neither of us enjoyed the first one that you were on which was.

14
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:45,436
I mean, it was kind of Al love to hate, and enjoy. But, yeah. This one was

15
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:52,396
enjoyment for pure enjoyment. Good. I'm glad to hear that because this one is like I said a fan favorite.

16
00:01:53,213 --> 00:02:00,360
And it it's a pretty long one. So there's... And I think there's gonna be a lot to talk about So on when let we get right into it.

17
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:08,015
Again, we are talking about the old castle secret which was published in June of nineteen forty eight

18
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:12,070
in the old comic four color, number one hundred and eighty nine

19
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:14,902
Sarah, I started to look and

20
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:22,054
Al reprint and how many times something has been reprinted in the United States, which kinda gives us an idea of that popularity.

21
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:34,268
This one's been reprinted eight times, which is a pretty good number. As mentioned, it's a longer one. It's thirty two pages in length. And this is a very significant one

22
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:36,835
that I would I would call this

23
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:39,108
kind of the true origin

24
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:44,886
of sc doc. Right? Because the last episode that we put out

25
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:46,895
saw his

26
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:50,981
technical origin in the story Christmas on Bear Mountain.

27
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:54,511
That's kind of a kind of a goofy story

28
00:02:55,062 --> 00:03:00,781
It's a lot of fun. I really like that, but, you know, it it doesn't really establish the character

29
00:03:01,437 --> 00:03:01,875
too much.

30
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:10,050
I had sent that one to you as well to go along with this one just just for some background. Did you get to read that? I I did.

31
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,670
It was

32
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:17,147
It was interesting and that he was kind of one dimensional. He was kind of

33
00:03:17,484 --> 00:03:19,379
a my league grumpy

34
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:26,931
happy eager to see them fail kind of character and he I enjoyed the development

35
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:29,940
away from that in this episode.

36
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:39,507
Right. And and I think you can really see that sort of pivot that Barks made from having him be that one off one dimensional character

37
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:44,427
to kind of, hey, This is this is someone that I'd really like to flesh out.

38
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:46,740
I'd like to establish him

39
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:48,535
as a major character

40
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:50,403
in the Ducktales.

41
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:51,900
Universe in their lives.

42
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:57,323
And so I'll I'll go back to the well, and I'm gonna give him this background

43
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,847
this very identifiable background and a lot of

44
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:02,401
a lot of characteristics

45
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:07,160
that he would, you know, keep throughout throughout the comics.

46
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:08,555
And

47
00:04:09,255 --> 00:04:09,755
that

48
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:15,968
identifiable in that all of us are dis descended from scottish royalty and have ancestral acids. Right?

49
00:04:16,546 --> 00:04:17,845
Yes. Exactly.

50
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:19,122
Or rather

51
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,359
or rather

52
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:32,695
identifiable in that this is the sc. This is, like, eighty five percent of the sc that we know and love today. Right? It's still it's obviously a very early version of him.

53
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:44,555
But there's there's a lot of, you know, what would make him a fan favorite going forward. And I think it'll be interesting as we talk about the story to kinda recognize what feels,

54
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,195
vary,

55
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:56,001
you know, classic sc and then what is something that indicates so, you know, this is a character that Barks is really still developing here. And this is not very typical.

56
00:04:57,015 --> 00:05:03,115
So just just a very brief synopsis for this one. This is gonna be, as you said kind of about

57
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:04,089
sc

58
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:05,807
ancestral Scotland.

59
00:05:06,546 --> 00:05:11,920
He is going to recruit the other Ducktales to help him find a treasure

60
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:13,810
hidden within its walls,

61
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,445
and they're gonna

62
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:20,388
run into what seems to be a supernatural mystery

63
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:21,998
regarding

64
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:32,501
regarding the treasure and who owns it, and who should keep it. And this one has some fun twists in turns. So I think we'll leave the synopsis at that and

65
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:35,492
get further into it in the story.

66
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:38,722
I do enjoy talking about backgrounds

67
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,560
trivia

68
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:43,610
regarding the story and its development and its creation.

69
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,622
And I also really like talking about background relating to the kind of history and culture

70
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:59,852
I'm gonna talk mostly about the stories background and I'm gonna kinda leave it to you to talk about the history and culture because I I think you had some fun looking into this.

71
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:04,595
Yeah. I'm ready. Awesome. So like I said, I would consider this

72
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:05,552
sc

73
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:13,045
true origin story because we see so much of what makes him a recognizable character. You know? We've got his

74
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,498
scottish background,

75
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:20,505
we've got the fact that he does come from this very long line

76
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:28,510
of of, you know, an old clan, a Scottish clan. And nobles at that. Yeah. Exactly. If you've got

77
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:31,341
if if your clan has a castle

78
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,406
named after itself, then then clearly you've got nobility

79
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:36,541
in your line.

80
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:47,333
We have the fact that he is rich. Although we don't really have the fact that he is super rich. Yeah. He's just I think garden variety rich in this one.

81
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:54,093
This might be what set them apart. Yes. Where he makes his extra billions.

82
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:55,531
Right.

83
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:56,969
And and

84
00:06:57,388 --> 00:06:58,886
marx didn't really

85
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:00,660
go for much continuity

86
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,620
in these stories. So there's there are some kind of like

87
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,635
explanations here and there for how he acquired his wealth, but

88
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:12,755
it really came about later

89
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:21,035
through some of our and then what a lot of other creators do like Don Rosa to kind of establish some of the facts of it. So

90
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,670
This ends up being a very important story

91
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:27,805
that creators like Don rose are gonna draw from.

92
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:31,629
But again, this is this is a very famous one.

93
00:07:32,246 --> 00:07:34,420
So there are some...

94
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:41,533
I was able to find a few interviews where Barks talked about making this one. There was a nineteen sixty two interview

95
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:47,090
that in which someone asked if you know, he went back to the well if he

96
00:07:47,628 --> 00:08:03,055
went back to... And had sc come back because he had gotten, you know, favorable comments or anything like that. And he said not a word, but I kind of liked old Scrooge and he filled a gap. We needed somebody to help donald Al out.

97
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:11,135
So, you know, this wasn't like he wasn't like the fan favorite as far as Barks new. This was really something personal him. He liked

98
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:13,492
he liked what he had created.

99
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:26,965
And so he wrote the story to explain where the character came from. And then he also talked about a little bit about how dark this story is. Right? Because this one is really notable in that it allude two skeletons,

100
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:32,420
it it's going to show what we believe to be a dead body

101
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:44,935
So you know, he talked about there being a little bit of horror story in this one, mentioning the skeleton world up in an old castle. And he described it as almost being like the Ec comics tradition.

102
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:51,585
And and he said that he managed to put it over without getting too morbid of it. Do you know the old Ec

103
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:56,954
horror comics? That's like a classic famous horror comet? Line. I definitely

104
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:03,705
I don't know Sarah, if you happen to look into any of the real castles that inspired

105
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,440
clan Castle?

106
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,640
I...

107
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,160
It's...

108
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,280
Since they don't really say

109
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,160
when

110
00:09:11,713 --> 00:09:12,213
the

111
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:14,247
castle was

112
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:15,284
built...

113
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,320
It was hard to kind of pinpoint Barks architectural style. It looked... It actually looked more continental

114
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:24,956
to me with the, like, cons turret.

115
00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:26,994
Cons turns. And

116
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:30,405
and it not at all in the dials of

117
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:40,427
scottish castles that I've seen. Castles in Scotland are a dime dozen. And they are so much fun to visit. I highly recommend

118
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:45,142
visiting all the castles you can, but they're generally more angular

119
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:46,640
and and square.

120
00:09:47,772 --> 00:09:49,349
They're more fortresses

121
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:53,258
rather than palaces. And this one appeared more

122
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:54,926
more like the

123
00:09:55,962 --> 00:10:01,246
In Germany, like the that inspired the Disney castle. With just the rounded

124
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:02,442
of everything.

125
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:08,327
Yeah. So that that's a good instinct because you're right, it's not modeled after a scottish castle,

126
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,446
but it is

127
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,692
it is model largely after one in wiggle

128
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,834
if let's see. I'm gonna go ahead and share this image with you. So this is

129
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:18,751
har

130
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:19,644
castle.

131
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:26,916
According to what I read. And again, you know, this one's a very famous story. So I think people had asked him a lot about

132
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:28,746
where he was inspired.

133
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:31,840
This one's supposed to be an ama of

134
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:40,425
har cat castle is like the main structure of it, but he added some turret and battle from Al

135
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:42,660
and a tower of cow

136
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,980
which are true Scottish castles

137
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:51,820
that are ones that figure in the legend of Mc bath. Many use Oh. Yeah. Have have you been to any of

138
00:10:52,175 --> 00:10:56,255
I don't know if those sound familiar. It sounds like you visited a few around there.

139
00:10:56,695 --> 00:10:57,195
There,

140
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:04,965
I I I could be wrong, but I believe that the one that you're saying is called Glam is actually pronounced

141
00:11:05,304 --> 00:11:06,422
Gladstone

142
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:07,561
I know this

143
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,807
because There is an episode of one of my favorite podcast podcasts,

144
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:12,685
Steph,

145
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:14,521
and there is

146
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:21,913
a a legend of the monster of guam and it's this, you know, supposedly the this monster.

147
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:25,142
Yeah. It's... I bet you're right. I bet that's the castle.

148
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:29,550
That it's talking about. I'm often surprised Al how things

149
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:31,986
are really supposed to be pronounced.

150
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:36,710
Oh, Scotland has... It's a it's a thing on Tiktok where,

151
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:42,548
you know, the on tip tiktok they have the pronounce this challenge just to see what different accents,

152
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,499
how they say different things. So

153
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:46,855
everywhere has

154
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:47,693
their

155
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:48,969
idiosyncratic

156
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:54,694
pronunciation. Right on. So, yeah, we've got we've got some pretty cool historical

157
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:55,573
castle

158
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:56,592
imagery in here.

159
00:11:57,191 --> 00:12:11,868
And Barks famously like to use national geographic as a model. So I I think that you can tell. Right? Because it looks to me like there was some care taken and drawing both the exterior and the interior of this castle.

160
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:19,218
Just from the backgrounds I can tell when we're in the dungeon versus when we're in, like, you know, a main part of the castle. So

161
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:25,717
I I think that's probably part of why this story is very well. Like. And then

162
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,890
cup a new thing that I've been doing for a couple episodes now is

163
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:40,939
just thinking about how global the fan base is for these these stories, I've been having some fun looking at some of the printing from around the world. And

164
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:44,735
trying to say some of the titles in their native languages.

165
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:49,418
And just paying attention to the different titles that get chosen. So

166
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:57,730
I picked six of them. I think I'm gonna butcher the first one pretty badly, which is the finnish title is is.

167
00:12:58,228 --> 00:12:58,728
Van

168
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:00,804
Sal,

169
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,809
which translates to secret to the old castle pretty close. Okay. Yeah.

170
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:08,721
And then the French title is Lu,

171
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:17,495
which translates to the Scottish ghost. So they're really... Yeah, They're really playing into the the Scott's part of the title with this one.

172
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:20,031
Germany, this one is

173
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:23,478
s

174
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:28,742
dispensed, which is uncle Sc and the castle ghost, and then in Mexico.

175
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,745
You know the secret to old castle.

176
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:37,985
Here's another one that i'll butcher shirts in Swedish,

177
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:39,345
then

178
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,065
Ga Bo

179
00:13:41,525 --> 00:13:42,025
ham

180
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:58,265
secret of the old castle. And then in the Uk for whatever reason it was at one point called capsule of fear. Oh out Yeah, some fun titles from around the world. And I I do think that it's notable how scary this one is. Right? I read this one to my kid.

181
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:05,260
And I'd say this one that's another kind of interesting background thing. This is scarier than the average Barks story.

182
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:08,771
And not preoccupied with, like, death and

183
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,428
violence. I got that impression too.

184
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:13,845
One in my notes, I wrote

185
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:14,899
spooky

186
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:18,774
with before with four o's. It was obviously

187
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:19,973
a cartoon.

188
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:22,210
So, you know, there wasn't an

189
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:26,930
skeleton and it wasn't even an actual skeleton. It was a shadow of a skeleton.

190
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,241
But they mentioned other skeletons.

191
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:30,530
They

192
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:33,920
came upon, you know, as you said, a supposedly

193
00:14:34,337 --> 00:14:37,407
a dead body spoiler luckily it wasn't.

194
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:38,984
How how often

195
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:40,554
did the

196
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,106
donald Ducktales comics get

197
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:51,180
spooky. That's an awesome question. I offhand, I would say this isn't probably the, like, five or six

198
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,480
scariest of the stories. You know?

199
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,180
They were frequently

200
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,020
creepy, but

201
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:12,574
this one's pretty notable in being creep than the average by a lot. Yeah. I can imagine putting myself back at, you know, single digit age. That it it might have been kind of scary in the same way that, like, the garfield

202
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:16,310
Halloween special back when we were single digit age,

203
00:15:16,924 --> 00:15:23,451
was sometimes too scary to watch even on, like, the tenth three watch. How... That was that was a randomly

204
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:25,806
incredibly scary piece of

205
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:32,612
animation or or I I remember that one too. That's a weird aside, but you're absolutely right. Though terrifying.

206
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:34,090
It was.

207
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:35,263
How often

208
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,220
did

209
00:15:36,597 --> 00:15:46,646
they... See it felt very scooby do es in that oh hears this creepy seeing and we've un it and it turns out it's just a regular

210
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:51,780
but nefarious person. Right. How often did that happen in these spooky stories?

211
00:15:52,394 --> 00:16:28,703
I would say that this one is kind of unique, you know, in and having that sort of sp doo feel. There's definitely, like, i I guess I can think of a couple stories where someone is trying to scare people and they do get on mass So there's probably Al a handful of them. There be like plots to scare people off Al valuable property going in the future, but this one does feel kinda unique. I'm trying to think about how much it must pre scooby doo dubai. I think. I think Scooby doo came around in the like early sixties or so. Yeah. It's a good decade or a decade and a half. Right. But... Yeah. It's definitely

212
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:34,217
definitely creep than the average Barks story. Was there an actual

213
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:37,787
did any of the more spooky stories

214
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,543
turn out to be

215
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:50,201
real ghosts real monsters, anything like that. Yeah. I mean, the duck are gonna definitely encounter, like, real monsters and real creatures of legend, but he doesn't usually

216
00:16:50,538 --> 00:16:53,210
combine like the creep with an actual

217
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,170
monster. It's usually, like, either creepy

218
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,730
or monstrous.

219
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:23,255
But, you know, there there are... He he wrote like five hundred some of these stories about a hundred of which are the the like adventure length ones. So I'm sure I can't think off the top of my head. I I remember there's a later one that has Al legend of werewolf where I believe it turns out to be similar to this. There's there are a lot of similar ones. There are a few similar ones to this. But I I'd say this one's pretty singular

220
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:27,463
in its creeping I don't think that there are as many that are as

221
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:32,230
preoccupied with, like death as this one. You don't really see a lot of death in these stories.

222
00:17:32,924 --> 00:17:33,983
Yeah. Okay.

223
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:39,615
So this one, I was Al little surprised at the value range I expected it to be

224
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:52,035
more valuable. But what I found was that a very good copy of it a nine nine point zero rated copy sold for four thousand eight hundred. Which, you know, is obviously a pretty penny. But

225
00:17:52,651 --> 00:18:00,242
compared to, like, last issue where we had the technical origin story that one was like, extremely valuable, I think went up to a hundred thousand.

226
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:13,185
That's that's what I've got for the sort of background of the story So as far as notable appearances in this one, we don't really have many characters at all because this one's so self contained. The only

227
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:28,858
apart from the Ducktales family now including Scrooge du, we just have the character of Scott, and this is a weird one. Right? Because you know, again spoiler, he's gonna turn out to be an impostor. So we never really meet this this scott up until

228
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:40,450
up until Don Rosa is gonna use him as a character in his flashback story. And then of course, I've been talking about which version of the characters we get in this one. I find it notable that

229
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:47,486
Barks still seems really interested in bravery and coward in this one. Right? Because we have this very, like,

230
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:48,760
coward

231
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,200
blow hard version of Donald

232
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,935
and and even Scrooge to a certain extent. Yeah. It was a nice contrast

233
00:18:56,474 --> 00:18:58,412
with the sc from

234
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:08,220
Christmas on the mountain kind of taking Al in Donald coward And then in this one, he was just as frightened

235
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,394
if not coward as donald. Right. And a couple of good, like, comedic moments. Of

236
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:22,987
of fear in this one. And as you have pointed out to me before, the kids are super brave they're not bothered by anything.

237
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:38,997
They're they're the problem solve and they're are the ones who save the day. Yeah. Exactly right. And and this one even more so than many of them. Right? This is, like really the kids story in in a lot of ways. Yeah. Alright. So, I think I'm ready to dive into

238
00:19:39,496 --> 00:19:44,991
the actual meat of this story. Are you ready for it, Sarah? I'm ready. Alright. Let's do it. So

239
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:48,913
The old Castle secret opens with Donald

240
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:52,996
receiving a phone call from his rich uncle sc,

241
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,070
asking

242
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,704
him to pay a visit for some

243
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,973
mysterious purpose. And so the Ducktales

244
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:02,948
they meet him at his mansion.

245
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:10,020
This this might be one of the last times that we'll see Scrooge having a butler. And he's not usually depicted going forward Al as

246
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:23,265
spending his money on something as frivolous as a butler. Sc reveals that the Mc fortunate is in bad shape and tells them that he needs to raise millions of dollars. Quick and we get a nice

247
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:36,805
sweet offer from the Nephews who offer him his their piggy Barks money. But Sc tells them that they've already got... He's already got access to the money he just doesn't know where it's hidden

248
00:20:37,465 --> 00:20:48,809
referring to millions in ancient treasure comments on this page? I mean, these children shouldn't be giving their money to Rich uncle. He should be taxed and blah blah blah.

249
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:52,002
I I choose interpret

250
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:58,768
Al wanting to highlight their generous nature. But yes. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So on the next page, Scrooge

251
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:01,239
starts to tell them about

252
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:06,393
a family secret Al legacy of treasure that's been in his

253
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,290
family for nine hundred years.

254
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:13,162
And he tells them that the treasures in Scotland

255
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:18,535
in his family castle in the huge old castle of dismal downs.

256
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,086
He he indicates we get some nice

257
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:29,245
character building that he owns the castle as the last of the clan Du. So he wants to bring the

258
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,805
Donald and the nephews over to help him find it. And

259
00:21:34,145 --> 00:21:36,500
he warns them the castle

260
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,100
is guarded by ghosts

261
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:46,255
of the clan, particularly the ghost old lacked Claimant mc doc who hid the treasure way back in the eleventh century.

262
00:21:46,815 --> 00:22:12,662
But he tells them, you know, it's not that easy generations of Mc. Search. For it. But then he reveals with a flourish that he's got Al aes his sleeve. He's got a... What must have looked like a very fancy new x ray machine at the time that he's gonna use to look right through the walls of the castle. That part made me laugh because obviously, we have our twenty first century, even late twentieth century sen

263
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:20,935
of... Oh, my goodness, x rays are dangerous we need to protect everybody from the radiation. It should only be used in small doses,

264
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:32,922
especially children need to be kept away from it. But They didn't understand that in the time period that this came out. X rays were such a part of everyday life that they had flo

265
00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:49,993
in shoe stores as a kind of marketing gimmick to take an x rate of your foot within a shoe to make sure it was fit properly and that lasted that started in about the nineteen twenties and and lasted up into the sixties.

266
00:22:50,451 --> 00:23:01,300
So Sure. This rich guy has an x machine and he's going to let the children use it. Right. I know it's it's amazing to look at like when something is new technology,

267
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,755
all the ways that people might of try and apply it. And

268
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,315
i I imagine,

269
00:23:08,735 --> 00:23:11,395
you know, x rays, I I saw that they've been

270
00:23:11,695 --> 00:23:12,970
discovered in the late

271
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:21,390
eighteen nineties, but I'm sure it wasn't mainstream for a bit. And then when it was, as you say, they're using it for just just about everything.

272
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:24,734
But this does seem like a clever way of

273
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:33,120
kind putting this twist on why the last of the clan. Could be the one to find it. Right? Because he's got he's the one with modern technology.

274
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,752
Yeah. And I I looked up apparently

275
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:37,921
apparently industrial

276
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:38,799
radio

277
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:45,995
really is a thing. Right? Using x rays on buildings, but they're they're generally using it to, like, check the quality of welding.

278
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:51,524
And and things like that. Alright. So on the next page, you know, the Ducktales

279
00:23:51,844 --> 00:23:55,840
are excited. They're they think that Uncle Sc just got a great plan.

280
00:23:56,815 --> 00:23:57,835
The only problem

281
00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:05,488
that he sees it is his concern is what happens when he does find. He's very read about ci

282
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:06,406
ghost

283
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,000
coming after him. The Nephews

284
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:19,986
aren't concerned he do in Louie. They're like ghosts can't hurt you. But this is where we start to see donald. The the two adults are gonna start to get nerves

285
00:24:20,323 --> 00:24:20,823
and

286
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:38,511
they have to really puff themselves up. We get a cute little site gag where one of the Nephews start them from behind the door just after they've have both puff themselves up to show how brave they are. And they faint. And so the nephews used to despair over how how fearless they aren't.

287
00:24:39,269 --> 00:25:07,050
And this is an interesting depiction of sc, you know, going forward or he is... He is not gonna be shown to kind of like, be open to supernatural stuff like this. I would say this is out of character for him based on, you know, when he gets really established. And so on the next page, we transitioned to the Ducktales arriving at dismal downs. It's a it's a really neat picture to me of them approaching the castle on Barks calls the Misty moore of Scotland.

288
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:14,983
What do you think really quickly Sarah of how they're depicting Scotland as as a local? So I looked up

289
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:17,017
the wikipedia entry

290
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:18,069
for

291
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:19,028
this

292
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:25,890
episode and there was a wikipedia entry just for dismal down. And so I read that.

293
00:25:26,847 --> 00:25:27,347
Geographically,

294
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:30,096
downs are a

295
00:25:30,911 --> 00:25:32,660
geographic feature that appear

296
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:39,039
down further south in great britain. Like, down on the like Southern coast of Apparently,

297
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:46,231
the castle is set technically situated in Ran moore, which is up in the kind of northern

298
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:57,750
part of Scotland far north, not super low the very tippy top. But very far north, which is a really baggy area. It's it's very desolate

299
00:25:58,144 --> 00:25:59,242
it's very isolated.

300
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,872
And I do appreciate the

301
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:10,230
of this depiction of it. Okay. I did wanna talk about clans. Yeah. Go for it. There there's no actual plan Mc.

302
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,750
And Yes I'm sure most people.

303
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:23,795
Know. But you may be disappointed to find out the closest names I found were in the, you know, alphabetically where Mc or Mcdowell. There's also

304
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:29,483
several branches of clan mcdonald's. Right. But there's there's no

305
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:30,561
clan.

306
00:26:32,952 --> 00:26:38,380
That they have that they have found evidence for. I'm sure it's out there somewhere. I mean

307
00:26:39,238 --> 00:26:39,738
Sure.

308
00:26:41,074 --> 00:26:45,503
Mac is the Al basically means son up. Mh.

309
00:26:45,902 --> 00:26:47,354
This is the son of Ducktales.

310
00:26:48,032 --> 00:26:48,891
Right. Excellent.

311
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:56,747
So when they... When the last of the clan does arrive at the castle, their the family of Ducktales are greeted by

312
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:58,238
his caretaker,

313
00:26:58,975 --> 00:27:01,231
Scott, I think Scott terrier

314
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:05,501
and, you know, he's got much more of a pronounced

315
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:06,515
accents

316
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:09,475
Scrooge screwed shows in this. We see him

317
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:12,035
using a lot of, like, very old fashioned

318
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:26,285
to to my Barks, like using the word Jan, which I don't know how often gets used in in modern Scott's. I would guess not. You know, I haven't heard it. I've heard kind of quite a bit of Scott, but that is

319
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:41,064
more of an old fashioned word. What the other... Accent here Is is it a pretty good depiction? So what I've noticed is that they... When the great vowel shift occurred, Scotland just kind of ignored it Right. So

320
00:27:42,082 --> 00:27:43,820
if you were to spell

321
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,458
scott's phonetic

322
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,856
in order to indicate an accent,

323
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:54,370
it would be rather difficult to read. But they did pepper in some Scott's words, you know, Huey,

324
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,830
instead of have

325
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:05,039
whatever what else there was a couple of other ones. Yee instead of you or... Yeah. Yeah. So that's an interesting one. In...

326
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:11,546
In Scott's, they say use. Mh. Meaning more than one use. But it's for

327
00:28:12,562 --> 00:28:18,351
American readers it's not a... It's not a bad depiction of the Scott's language.

328
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,125
You know, there are some Scott words pepper in, but it's not... Obviously, it's not accurate.

329
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:24,997
Because and it's

330
00:28:25,813 --> 00:28:27,031
it can be ins

331
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:28,604
to American.

332
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:50,841
Of course. So, yeah, not not a bad depiction I'm guessing for someone who didn't have access to, like, the wikipedia guide. Yeah. I was so impressed with some of this because he he... It's not like he could just call somebody in Scotland or, you know, facetime time with them and and look up the dictionary dictionaries Scott's language, like I was able to. Right. Excellent.

333
00:28:51,434 --> 00:28:51,934
So

334
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,007
Scott does greet the Ducktales and,

335
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:59,815
you know, they kinda... He kinda gives them an update. The treasure is still not found.

336
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,810
Scott also believes in the ghost of ser

337
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,050
and, you know, warns them

338
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:12,385
that he bash the heads of pro that are searching for the treasure, but he wouldn't he wouldn't bash

339
00:29:12,765 --> 00:29:14,985
the head of a clan mc Ducktales

340
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:15,825
and

341
00:29:16,445 --> 00:29:24,133
he would only bash those that, you know, might be finding the treasure, which gives him a pretty good setup for later.

342
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:26,591
So on the next page,

343
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:31,680
the ducks are just having some conversation with Scott and wandering

344
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:39,870
through the the castle. You got some really cool panels I think here of the various suits of armor throughout the castle.

345
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,170
We see Donald becoming

346
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:49,172
more and more scared as they walk through talking about some of the history of the castle of the ancestors.

347
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,966
We get a really great site gag where they look at

348
00:29:52,677 --> 00:30:05,109
large suit of armor that says that it's from twelve o five and it's sir roast Mc who died from over eating after robbing the kings pantry. It's it's kind of a silly, like fat suit of armor

349
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:12,346
that... It's kind of a taste joke, but it's It's pretty funny. It's a good side. Yeah. So I went to look up armor.

350
00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:15,382
The history story of armor. And

351
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:16,901
plate armor

352
00:30:17,294 --> 00:30:27,744
such as is depicted here. Was not really a thing until about the fifteen sixteen hundreds. And and so it's sir elder Mc Ducktales. That was killed by station

353
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:32,506
Saxons in nine forty six might probably have only been wearing leather. Work.

354
00:30:33,263 --> 00:30:37,771
Roast up So while using the the armor as a site gag,

355
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,129
it's technically

356
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:40,008
not

357
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,766
accurate historically

358
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,652
So they might have been they might have been using scale mail, then definitely not plate armor at that point. Did you

359
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:58,625
consider the fact that most of these suits of armor are way too tall for ducks like Donald and sc. Did that ran across your mind at all?

360
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,319
Oh my goodness.

361
00:31:00,698 --> 00:31:02,277
Used to blew my mind, Mark.

362
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:12,405
Well, I don't know that I would have thought of it either. But... But Don Rosa addresses this later. He has a pretty good gag in his life and times of sc Mc

363
00:31:12,825 --> 00:31:14,565
where he allude to how fearsome

364
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:17,940
warriors, the the clan Ducktales.

365
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,660
Because they would only wear the top half of the armor and their enemies couldn't see out of the,

366
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,260
you know, out of the eye, the ice.

367
00:31:27,775 --> 00:31:37,135
To to fight the clan Who would be able to hack them at the at the legs and stuff. Excellent. So I like that I like the Don Rosa thought about that.

368
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,450
But I think, you know, Bart just wanted to show a regular

369
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,970
suit of armor obviously.

370
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:42,930
So

371
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,550
the docs are talking about, you know,

372
00:31:46,523 --> 00:31:48,299
they they note the fact that

373
00:31:48,677 --> 00:31:49,974
you won't find ci

374
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:50,892
armor

375
00:31:51,388 --> 00:32:11,550
in here because he disappeared, including his armor during the siege of ten fifty seven, and Sc mentions that the legend is that he sealed himself in the walls of the castle along with his treasure. You know what's going on in Scotland and ten fifty seven? Oh jeez. What... Is this like Had wall? No. That's like a thousand years before

376
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,150
Alright. What what's going on? I have

377
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:20,484
educate me Scott's history wise. Oh, out damned spot N

378
00:32:20,902 --> 00:32:32,789
yes. Of course. That's Al. Next stuff was killed by Malcolm on the third in ten fifty seven. Wow. Look at that. Yeah. So oh, I'm getting goosebumps well done Carl Barks using

379
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:35,303
an actual bit of Scottish history

380
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:36,195
as

381
00:32:36,534 --> 00:32:52,411
you know, he doesn't say like, oh, he probably helped. Knock on the third to kill Mc, and then he got some spoils from this. But if you know history, then you know where he got his spoils. Well, that is a fun fact. And knowing that the castle was partly

382
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,864
modeled after

383
00:32:54,242 --> 00:33:07,970
after that is is great. Awesome. So on the next page, we see the Ducktales get around and to setting up the x ray machine. And they start to look through the walls of the castle, and it shows the passage of a couple of hours.

384
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:21,557
And then Donald brings the x machine to us to suspicious looking bulge in the walls. And when he looks through the port, he gives that classic donald whack cry and he kills over fainted.

385
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:30,503
Obviously he's found something very frightening. One of the nephews looks in and he sees the armor and bones of what must be the remains of ci.

386
00:33:31,095 --> 00:33:37,466
So they figure that the treasure must be nearby and they get very excited to keep look And so on the next page,

387
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:44,187
they they look for a little bit longer until they find what appears to be a chest in the walls,

388
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:56,560
a box in the walls and when Sc looks in, he identifies it as an old Roman jewel case and gets excited that it must be the treasure so they pry the wall open, and

389
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:19,736
they do find that box. It's very heavy. Scott helps them set it on the table. And, Sarah, I like that they find the treasure really quickly in this, Right? I think that's kind of a nice change of pace. Usually, the treasure comes at the end of a story. Okay. Any any other thoughts on this? What about the fact that it's a roman jewel case? So as you as you mentioned earlier,

390
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:23,702
He wall and nine wall Those were all...

391
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,914
Those are part of the exploits of the Romans.

392
00:34:27,313 --> 00:34:30,486
So there there there was a roman history in Scotland.

393
00:34:31,118 --> 00:34:34,568
They're the ones who built Had wall and then the anton

394
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:39,312
built the Anti nine wall and then Sep sever

395
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:43,074
was like, no. That's a little bit too far. Let's go back. Basically,

396
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,466
they couldn't get this

397
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:46,621
tele

398
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:51,610
as they called them. Under control, so they just kind of retreated and left them alone.

399
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,710
There were... They did go a little bit further

400
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,590
into Scotland

401
00:34:58,104 --> 00:35:00,539
not as far as Ran moore,

402
00:35:01,177 --> 00:35:07,040
that that doesn't mean that you know, they couldn't have had somebody had access in Scotland to

403
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:12,765
Roman jewel case, etcetera, etcetera. Right. Jewel cases get around clearly. Yes.

404
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:14,302
Alright. So

405
00:35:14,854 --> 00:35:22,276
when they open the when they open the the chest, they do find millions in gold and gems. They found the Mc dot hoard.

406
00:35:22,928 --> 00:35:27,174
Sc identifies that there are old viking clasp in it, norman

407
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,220
Norman rings, coins from the midst of Realms,

408
00:35:31,273 --> 00:35:41,493
He greed looks at it and says that it's worth billion. I like this touch. I liked that he mentions some of the different sources of where this wealth comes from. It's not just like an anonymous

409
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:47,614
pile of treasure like these things often or. Yeah. And it it speaks again to kind of the accuracy

410
00:35:48,194 --> 00:35:50,014
of the the history,

411
00:35:50,594 --> 00:35:52,974
Scotland has a long history of

412
00:35:53,314 --> 00:35:53,814
viking

413
00:35:54,394 --> 00:35:54,589
interaction

414
00:35:55,407 --> 00:35:58,538
shall we say. Yeah. It's a nice general way of putting it.

415
00:35:59,154 --> 00:36:03,854
And and so there there's quite a bit of viking and... There's quite a bit of viking influence

416
00:36:04,313 --> 00:36:05,251
within Scotland

417
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:06,886
and then the Normans

418
00:36:07,304 --> 00:36:11,012
mentioning the... Just across the channel of of Southern

419
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:20,609
England. In ten fifty seven, they had quite invaded England yet. But there was still quite a bit of interaction as they were only a shifts right away.

420
00:36:21,184 --> 00:36:23,644
And, yeah, Romans, vikings,

421
00:36:23,984 --> 00:36:30,815
Normans, that's all period accurate and Al excellent touch Yeah. We know the Romans got around.

422
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,654
And, you know it's interesting to me because I don't think that a lot of American readers might have

423
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:39,765
imagine they're being as much like cultural

424
00:36:40,102 --> 00:36:44,906
interchange in Scotland a thousand years ago. But as you say that is pretty periodic.

425
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:48,907
So the Ducktales have found the jewels and Scott

426
00:36:49,284 --> 00:36:52,613
warns them, you know, they gotta get the treasure out of there quickly before.

427
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:58,139
Finds them. So Donald who's just woken up gets assigned to

428
00:36:58,518 --> 00:37:05,783
take the Barks out. And as he's running, he seems to get bash in the head by some kind of invisible force,

429
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:08,816
which Uncle Sc, you know, quickly

430
00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:14,344
identifies as the ghost of ci plaque So on the next page, we get a pretty cool visual

431
00:37:14,804 --> 00:37:16,344
of the box rising

432
00:37:16,644 --> 00:37:22,390
and floating in the air. As though it's being carried away by a ghost. And

433
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:26,220
the nephews use, they're they're pretty brave. They're pursuing

434
00:37:26,654 --> 00:37:34,845
whatever is carrying the box. And as they round the corner, they and fear. They give that classic whack as they see

435
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:50,025
the silhouette or the shadow of a skeleton, which they identify as the bones of ci plaque, So now they do believe in the ghost story, but they're not deter. They're gonna keep following it. And so Donald wakes up after being knocked out.

436
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:52,896
And he sees the ghost of ci

437
00:37:53,914 --> 00:37:58,504
his shadow as well. But he has a different reaction. He runs out in terror

438
00:37:59,004 --> 00:38:03,144
before checking in. He calls out from the courtyard to find out if everyone safe.

439
00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:13,549
And I'm just gonna read this because it's a it's a pretty good a good exchange. He says hello in there is everybody's safe? And from behind him and a rain barrel, uncle Sc,

440
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:22,564
emerges and says, I am. I found that I have asthma too, which is something that Donald had mentioned in a blessed way that he he had.

441
00:38:23,258 --> 00:38:26,991
I thought that was pretty funny there. Yeah. I wasn't expecting to see

442
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:29,346
uncle sc there,

443
00:38:29,963 --> 00:38:34,114
and it it was a nice way to put the kids up on the forefront

444
00:38:34,614 --> 00:38:36,434
and and kind of equal legalize

445
00:38:36,894 --> 00:38:38,874
Donald and uncle sc,

446
00:38:39,494 --> 00:38:40,689
especially in contrast

447
00:38:41,228 --> 00:38:42,208
to the

448
00:38:42,827 --> 00:38:43,926
Christmas on the Mountain

449
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:45,005
comm issue.

450
00:38:45,344 --> 00:38:49,560
Right. Alright. So we get a a nice sequence of the kids chasing

451
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,339
the ghosts.

452
00:38:51,073 --> 00:39:07,339
They have to break through a door that's been been locked. And when they get beyond it, they find Scott who seems to have been knocked out. He explains to the ghost or something hit him. And they check with him on on where the ghost might have gone,

453
00:39:07,974 --> 00:39:22,076
and he says, you know, really the ghost could be anywhere. They pointed out a door that's been brick up and he explains that that goes down to the dungeons, but it was sealed up by search swamp pole back in twelve twenty and that there's no other known entrance

454
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:23,312
to the dungeons.

455
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:25,745
So they they figured that ci

456
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:33,975
must be in the main castle. Dig get. You go ahead. Do you want know what was going on in Scotland in twelve twenty? I do. Nothing.

457
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:37,179
It's it's it's

458
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:41,779
it was such a a kind of dry period that I completely

459
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:42,919
understand how

460
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:43,899
Swamp

461
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:46,234
decided that the dungeons should just be for

462
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:58,938
up. Yeah. The darkest to the dark ages, I guess. So the nephews are creeped out as they think about ci athletes go being in there. And then they hear the clan of a suit of armor and

463
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:29,542
the audience can pretty quickly identify that it's Donald, wearing the top half of a suit of armor, but they ambush him. On the next page they they learned that it is Donald, who has come in there to track them down. So I like that, you know, even though he is very terrified of the ghost, he was concerned enough with an nephews used to to armor up and and come come get them. But the Nephews are really determined. They run off and they tell donald, You know, you're gonna have to catch us to get to stop us from pursuing the treasure.

464
00:40:30,477 --> 00:40:43,814
He demonstrates with Scott, who says that he he's also freaked down. He's gonna get out of there too. And, you know, I'm I'm reminded of the fact that Bravery is not the quality of never feeling fear. Right? Bravery is when you

465
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:49,134
overcome fear. So I like that. Yeah. I mean, it is a it's a good comment because

466
00:40:49,869 --> 00:40:58,267
the the children exe that when they first see that ghost. Right? They're like, I'm gonna believe every ghost story from now on.

467
00:40:59,346 --> 00:41:01,219
This is real ghosts are scary

468
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:06,019
let's go get it. Right. And and even Donald, who is coward

469
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:13,274
throughout this also displays Bravery right as he works to overcome it because he needs to get his nephews out.

470
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:16,994
Yeah. So. So when he's left by himself, he

471
00:41:17,774 --> 00:41:21,208
he looks for a helmet. To wear. And

472
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:33,745
this is another cool visual where we see the ghost or something lifting the helmet off his head and trying to knock him out again. But Donald been very clever. He has put on a second helmet,

473
00:41:34,424 --> 00:41:39,054
but not clever enough not to not to kind of mock the ghosts.

474
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:41,044
Because the ghost

475
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:49,271
kicks him right out the window and he lands back in the courtyard where sc is still hiding. I liked those that succession of panels

476
00:41:50,128 --> 00:41:53,182
because you have the the joke of.

477
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:55,909
I was wearing two helmet

478
00:41:56,407 --> 00:41:57,186
and then

479
00:41:57,922 --> 00:42:04,574
the ghosts and and then you're like, okay. Good job. Donald, but then the goes one up upstairs. And you can see the footprint

480
00:42:05,194 --> 00:42:16,183
straight Donald be behind. That's right. He gets kicked out the window. Yeah. It is a nice sight bag. Alright. So on the next page, we flash back to the Nephews who are still searching.

481
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:21,564
And they they seem to come to a hall where there are a lot of suits of armor and they're

482
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:22,481
looking

483
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,454
sequentially in each suit of armor. And when they get to the last one in the row,

484
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,614
the one of the nephews is

485
00:42:29,474 --> 00:42:31,709
shocked to see that there's a skeleton

486
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:41,841
in that one. And it's a pretty big contrast right because when Donald saw skeleton he he fainted a dead away. But this nephew keeps his senses and

487
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:47,755
just tells them, you know, there's a skeleton in there. And so they're they're wondering why is this

488
00:42:48,069 --> 00:43:00,584
why is this Mc du still in a suit armor? Why need buried like the rest of them? And so they look at the p or whatever where it says the and they find that it sir swamp whole, Mc.

489
00:43:01,044 --> 00:43:02,184
And they

490
00:43:02,764 --> 00:43:08,559
reflect on the fact. Scott had mentioned and that he's the one who sealed up. The dungeons. So this is,

491
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:20,917
you know, a big part of the mystery of the story, and it's some... I think some cool table setting. I like that they have found some helmets as well and that they're all slightly different from each other.

492
00:43:21,295 --> 00:43:29,049
Yeah. Yeah. It's a good look. It's it makes for an interesting look to the story and it shows the that's being resourceful. So

493
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:34,251
the he doing Louie are pondering, you know, the mystery of the castle

494
00:43:34,668 --> 00:43:39,169
and they're still looking around they hear a sound that they

495
00:43:39,707 --> 00:43:41,323
expect to be ci.

496
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:47,141
They they think that they've got him cornered, but they find that he must have slipped through

497
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:59,713
door. So they get ready to jump in and ambush him on the other side of the door and when they quickly dive through the door, they find that it's not another room, but it's actually a castle battle.

498
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:32,425
So this is like a a really classic dead end And as soon as they're out the door, it slams closed and that you hear the lock click and they find that they've been tricked and they've been trapped out side on this battle. It's too far for them to jump because the shallow mode is a hundred feet down. So they're their stuck pretty good. And we flashback back to their uncles where sc is and treating Donald to go back and look. But Donald like, hey, It's your turn. I've been in there plenty and Donald like,

499
00:44:33,183 --> 00:44:42,130
sir clap is not gonna hurt you you're the last of his skin folk. Even though I guess, technically Donald related, but I think he's not, you know, in in line the way Scrooge.

500
00:44:42,808 --> 00:44:44,705
And Sarah, I really like the...

501
00:44:45,163 --> 00:44:48,018
A lot of the story is gonna take place on this battle

502
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:48,936
specifically.

503
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:50,947
And it's an interesting

504
00:44:51,366 --> 00:45:09,345
spot for me. I really feel when the ducks get trapped out there. It feels like it feels like good peril to me. It does it feels like a good dead end. Definitely there's peril from being trapped from from falling from a height and an inability to go back in and and site, which is what they wanna do.

505
00:45:09,723 --> 00:45:11,061
Right. And and this

506
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:12,019
battle

507
00:45:12,437 --> 00:45:15,570
specifically is gonna get used as a setting and some of those

508
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:28,269
life in times of sp mc redux stories that Don rose that does later. So that's probably part of why it stands out in my mind. So on the next page, we see sc nervous looking around himself

509
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:35,920
and he ultimately is gonna end up trapped out on the battle along with the kids. Right? They

510
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:40,255
they end up ambush him, but he's been tricked the same way.

511
00:45:40,868 --> 00:45:41,368
So

512
00:45:41,826 --> 00:45:44,999
that leaves all of the Ducktales except for donald

513
00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:47,890
stuck in this position, this predicament.

514
00:45:48,543 --> 00:45:49,043
Sc

515
00:45:49,539 --> 00:46:03,132
despair, Donald not brave enough to come and help them. Scott is their only hope. And Donald, we flashback Barks to Donald who's pacing around and figures that, you know, enough time has past that something must have happened to sc,

516
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,980
which means that it's up to Donald.

517
00:46:06,354 --> 00:46:14,055
And again, you know, I like the resolve that he shows here. He's he's afraid, but he has to go in and he knows that any does.

518
00:46:14,907 --> 00:46:22,874
So he grabs a line of rope planning to drag the kids out if he has to, he helmets up again, and he

519
00:46:23,374 --> 00:46:25,354
looks around. I did...

520
00:46:26,054 --> 00:46:34,636
I just looked at my notes, and I was wrong about the... When late armor came in it came in in the fourteenth century.

521
00:46:35,053 --> 00:46:44,555
Okay. So still still the timeline is is off. Yeah. Cool. I can probably move that around if you care, but we've corrected the record here.

522
00:46:45,749 --> 00:46:50,165
Yeah i even remember what I said so I can't repeat it. Yeah. No worries.

523
00:46:51,223 --> 00:46:58,727
So Donald is exploring. He's trying to figure out where they are. And he comes across Scott living quarters.

524
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:03,516
You know, he it's identifiable as Scott room because of the solitary picture

525
00:47:03,909 --> 00:47:06,125
of Scott himself that

526
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:07,761
that he's got.

527
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:14,363
He doesn't see the man in there. And then when he turns, he is terrified

528
00:47:14,782 --> 00:47:15,761
to see

529
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:20,475
Scott in the classic dead corpse posture.

530
00:47:21,029 --> 00:47:42,715
On his bed. Covered all the way up by the sheets. Yep. And you know? If I were if I were in a creepy castle like that, don't think I would be in the right frame of mind to think about the logical fallacy of how could he have covered himself when he died. Right? I'm very sympathetic to donald there. Well, I mean, I I didn't give it as Second thought either until just now, but,

531
00:47:43,054 --> 00:47:47,005
you know, that could have been just a very kind ghost

532
00:47:47,384 --> 00:47:48,482
to kill

533
00:47:48,859 --> 00:48:04,252
Scott and then cover him, you know, that right one of the tropes in in movies and Tv shows is that if if the body is covered, usually the murder was done by somebody who cared about them. That's right. That's baby very response

534
00:48:04,844 --> 00:48:14,277
maybe with Scott being there so long, the ghost grew a little bit affectionate, but then, you know, realized he had to do what he had to do when he went after the jewels

535
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,950
so it it just... It just blocks over me. Yeah.

536
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:33,266
Swear up. So Donald runs of course in terror. And, you know, I I'm I'm looking closer at these two panels at the bottom. I I really like these two panels of him fleeing, especially the one on the right of him zag around some of the support pillars in the castle.

537
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:44,305
Because Donald is just terrified. He knows that he's gotta get the kids quickly because they're in grave danger. So on the next page, he is following some ghostly

538
00:48:44,725 --> 00:48:45,225
footsteps

539
00:48:45,605 --> 00:49:13,428
and he resolves to get a rope around around the ghost. He follows him through that same door onto the battle and he gets kicked out outside and locked locked out with the rest of the apps in the same manner. And so they're reunited and one of the Nephews explains that they're waiting for for Scott to come and rescue them and this is a pretty great Al well where Donald is kind of lying down resigned, and he says you're waiting for Scott.

540
00:49:13,887 --> 00:49:16,698
This is a fine state of affairs. I like that a lot.

541
00:49:17,577 --> 00:49:24,324
So we see we see the passage of time, you know, the docs are kind of figuring out what what are their options?

542
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:32,655
And one of the Nephews takes another look over the battle. And he realizes that there is a part of the mode that seems to be a little bit deeper.

543
00:49:33,229 --> 00:49:48,768
So using the rope that Donald has brought up, they can get about, you know, part way down. And if they figure if they swing down that the nephew you may be able to survive the drop if he can get in just the right place. So this is a really nice tense moment.

544
00:49:49,544 --> 00:49:54,270
This is another example, two where Barks draws a random bird in the foreground.

545
00:49:54,607 --> 00:50:17,872
Which I really like as the nephews swings. You start a bird and he manages to land in the moat deep enough. He start a frog and he so he's made it safely and you know, it does seem like a lot of trouble to go to and then call for the other nephews to be drops down. But or does really tend to like to keep the nephews used together. Any thoughts Numbers. Yeah.

546
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:26,916
So this is the part of the comic where we really transition to it being kind of the kids show. Right? We've been focused on them before, but now we know that their

547
00:50:27,255 --> 00:50:35,834
uncles are really trapped. And so they've got... They've got Al look around they're locked out of the hassle at this point, and they need to figure out another way to get in.

548
00:50:36,251 --> 00:50:40,737
They they surmise that these castles always had secret entrances

549
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:53,897
which I imagine is probably true, sarah. A lot of them probably had ways to get in in in the event of a siege or or something like that. They're there were tunnels generally kind of

550
00:50:54,435 --> 00:50:55,852
that went through sellers.

551
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:03,574
There were secret water tunnels so that if the castle were under siege, they could still get to a water source.

552
00:51:04,432 --> 00:51:16,509
All kinds of stuff like that. Alright. So back to the tunnel, they figured that they need to be looking for a grove of trees for the end of the tunnel, but there there aren't any trees for miles so they

553
00:51:16,926 --> 00:51:19,818
explore. And the only thing of note that they find

554
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:29,050
in the perimeter of the castle is the old Mc burial rounds. So they start to look through the graves. And they find graves for sur

555
00:51:29,429 --> 00:51:30,867
Docs or stuff to.

556
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:32,685
And then one of the nephews

557
00:51:33,078 --> 00:51:37,542
stumbles on something interesting, the grave for ser swamp pole mc.

558
00:51:37,981 --> 00:51:44,198
And, you know, the other nephews don't catch on immediately it's so interesting to find sir swamp pulls marker.

559
00:51:45,014 --> 00:51:45,514
But

560
00:51:46,051 --> 00:51:54,387
this one points out, you know, the fact that that guy was never buried. Right? They found his body in the suit of armor. So they're puzzling over

561
00:51:54,765 --> 00:51:56,874
why he would have a grave and

562
00:51:57,294 --> 00:52:18,304
that nephew points out that ser swamp pull is the guy who had sealed off the dungeons. So there must be a connection to that and they surmise that, you know, this grave must be the location of the end of the tunnel. And after playing with the grave a little bit, they're able to get it to open up the slab of the grave opens up like the door

563
00:52:18,604 --> 00:52:33,901
with steps leading down into an underground tunnel. So this is probably one of my favorite aspects of the story. Right? This seems like like, often when a story is built around there being a mystery, it's it's kind of... There's not really a neat little logical

564
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:53,712
thing to figure out in a kid's comment like this. But I I would really like this how, you know, you have to figure out well, we found this guy's body. Why does he also have a grave, this must mean something? I just think I just think that was really cool. Yeah. It was kind of Al una expected. The this whole story had some little inter woven

565
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:54,629
mysteries

566
00:52:55,046 --> 00:53:03,629
within mysteries. Right? To the point where I even went back and looked at some panels to see if I had missed clues. And

567
00:53:03,969 --> 00:53:09,281
yeah. It was really neat. These little mysteries is woven and Yeah. Alright. So the nephews

568
00:53:09,778 --> 00:53:21,118
to descend into this tunnel and while they're going down, we got a nice line here. One of the nephew says ballots it's damp here in full of spiders and the other asks, what did you expect air conditioning?

569
00:53:21,596 --> 00:53:24,123
That? It's called Air con here.

570
00:53:24,522 --> 00:53:33,859
And almost nobody has it. Oh you and I are from the land of air conditioning, so that's gotta be tough. Oh, it makes the... like seventy two

571
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:34,979
degree f

572
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:37,099
ninety percent humidity days

573
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:37,940
miserable.

574
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:53,000
Yeah. Al bet. So while the nephews are going down the tunnel, we flash back to Donald and sc and they're pondering how hard it's gonna be for the nephews to get back in because they don't have a key. And we got a good gag here that

575
00:53:53,619 --> 00:53:56,160
kinda just needs to be red to be appreciated.

576
00:53:56,715 --> 00:54:03,315
Sc says, you know, how stupid of them? I could have learned them this gun and they could have shot the lock and he pulls out a revolver.

577
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:09,128
And Donald Chi him, he says you Scrooge all that gun will unlock this door and

578
00:54:09,823 --> 00:54:10,323
sc

579
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:25,951
tells him, know, you're right. I'll i'll unlock it, but there's something I want you to do first nephew. Wind up both feet and give me a good swift kick. You know, I I thought that was a fun little moment of absent minded. It's totally out of character

580
00:54:26,288 --> 00:54:33,026
going forward for sc Mc, you know, Barks really depict them like this for the most part in the future,

581
00:54:33,882 --> 00:54:43,622
except in the story where he famously has some memory loss. But but I I thought it was very funny. I thought it was one of the funniest parts of the story. And so we transitioned back to the Nephews

582
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,825
who have approached a part of the tunnel where they have to do the torch because they've... It's lit ahead.

583
00:54:50,602 --> 00:54:53,576
And they sure enough they have come into the dungeons

584
00:54:54,249 --> 00:55:04,525
which seem to be empty. There's a very creepy panel where there's a a terrifying looking wrap watching them so that this has some really good to me creepy

585
00:55:04,904 --> 00:55:08,584
atmosphere. And so they look around until they spy the jewel box.

586
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:20,114
So they... They're very excited. They dive at the jewel box. And this is a this is a terrifying panel for a kids comic. You know, they they see the silhouette or the shadow

587
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:21,454
of the ghost,

588
00:55:22,015 --> 00:55:41,864
the skeleton ghost, rear back with a sword ready to strike. And then Yeah. Yeah. And then in the next panel, the the sword is floating in mid air. Yeah. It's a it's a very cool effect. Right? We see both the shadow of the skeleton and and the sword and then the sword like you say floating by itself. And

589
00:55:42,204 --> 00:55:47,152
they're being pursued So they they have to hope that they can get out of the

590
00:55:47,889 --> 00:55:48,828
walled up entrance.

591
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:51,581
They've they've found the secret entrance

592
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:54,487
it's in the pillar behind sir swamp pull.

593
00:55:55,165 --> 00:55:56,782
They're running away from

594
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:04,458
what seems to be the ghost, which is just slashing at the air, and then we transition to their uncles who hear them in trouble.

595
00:56:04,796 --> 00:56:14,855
The nephews round the corner crash right into Donald. And the ghost ends up pursuing them and, you know, tram Donald. And when sc sees

596
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:18,665
that the ghost is in pursuit. He fires his revolver

597
00:56:19,004 --> 00:56:19,944
at the ghost

598
00:56:20,363 --> 00:56:21,941
and we see the skeleton

599
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:22,874
kind of

600
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:27,894
flinch in a way that, you know, a ghost shouldn't really be afraid of bullets.

601
00:56:28,374 --> 00:56:31,654
And Donald is celebrating that he doesn't like the bullets.

602
00:56:32,387 --> 00:56:33,445
So the ghost

603
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:43,111
runs back right over him. Donald says a line that kinda puzzles me here. Sarah. He says blow your horn you invisible juggernaut or not.

604
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:49,440
I I figured that that must be a reference to something or Al align, you know, a quote

605
00:56:49,978 --> 00:56:52,911
maybe a song lyric or something, but I couldn't find anything

606
00:56:53,368 --> 00:57:01,945
about that. So I don't know. Maybe maybe a listener will have an idea. Yeah I don't suppose you recognize that. I just just assumed it was a a nineteen

607
00:57:02,645 --> 00:57:03,145
forties

608
00:57:03,565 --> 00:57:04,065
comics

609
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:06,565
for f u a whole.

610
00:57:07,085 --> 00:57:08,598
Right. So, the nephews

611
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:14,742
pursue him to see where he goes, but he slams himself shut down down towards the dungeons.

612
00:57:15,174 --> 00:57:26,334
And they can't figure out the catch for that secret door. So Donald decides he's gonna see if there's a crow bar in Scott room. And when he gets to Scott room, he finds that Scott has vanished.

613
00:57:27,052 --> 00:57:43,969
He suppose that the ghost must have taken him away because you know, he was... He was his corpse was just there. And he gets off a good line. He says he was colder than a macro and then the nephew, one of the nephew says, speaking of macro, don't you smell something fishy about this disappearance

614
00:57:44,387 --> 00:57:47,601
and the other nephew says that it reap of red herring

615
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:54,522
Did you also like this? That was just delightful fall well done. Well done, sir.

616
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,715
Yeah. That's a that's a great sequence of lines.

617
00:57:58,453 --> 00:58:03,996
A red herring, of course being something that's meant to distract to you in in a story.

618
00:58:04,494 --> 00:58:13,948
Mister direct you? Yes. Yes. Exactly. And so the nephews look around the room to investigate and they find what one of the nephews

619
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:14,825
thinks

620
00:58:15,202 --> 00:58:28,651
might be fly spray. When they spray it at the curtain, we see that it has some kind of weird looking effect on the curtain. I don't know about you to me. It's not immediately obvious that it's supposed to look transparent.

621
00:58:29,404 --> 00:58:41,502
But we can tell that something weird is going on with that spray. So the nephews user saying they know how the ghosts are made. They obviously can tell that you know, this is a trade a spray that makes things transparent.

622
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:47,783
So they go back to figure out how to pursue the ghost and they do figure out how to

623
00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:51,399
release the latch behind ce swamp Armor.

624
00:58:52,198 --> 00:58:59,694
They run down the tunnel where they can feel blowing and that indicates that, you know, he must be too far away. And so the ducks

625
00:59:00,031 --> 00:59:02,741
pursue the ghost until they're out onto the moo.

626
00:59:03,393 --> 00:59:11,006
They emerge from the tunnel and the grave and they look around. Donald is able to see the box being carried by the ghost.

627
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,877
Out there going over a ridge. So the Nephews

628
00:59:15,216 --> 00:59:25,715
encourage everyone to corner him and force him to go through a mud hole. And so you you can see, this is some cool art that shows the invisible ghost or whatever the entity is.

629
00:59:26,133 --> 00:59:28,349
Going through this muddy

630
00:59:28,688 --> 00:59:29,526
pond or whatever.

631
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:41,377
While they're passing through the nephews speculating, you know what it truly is, And when he emerges Donald says, it's a mud man with no head. Because you can see a lot of mud covering a body.

632
00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:49,040
So one of the nephews use tackle this thing, bringing it down and sc holds it at Bay with the gun. And the Nephews

633
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,700
say, you know, just wait a moment. We'll see who it is.

634
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,040
And

635
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:58,975
we we do see that this is Scott becoming gradually visible.

636
00:59:59,515 --> 01:00:21,785
So sc says, sky, my old faithful servant. You tried to steal my treasure And this is where we learned that we have not been... We haven't even met Scott at all. This character reveals that he is actually diamond dipped, the jewel thief. He explains that Scott had died months ago and that Diamond Dick has been handing to be him so that he could get a chance

637
01:00:22,123 --> 01:00:23,062
at the horde.

638
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:36,846
He further explains that he knew about the treasure because his third wife was like a distant Mc Ducktales On her a great Grandfather side. And you know, this is the time where we get all the explanations. Right? He explains

639
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:41,089
that he's been making himself invisible using a chemical

640
01:00:41,427 --> 01:00:52,158
spray that he stole from a foreign spy during the war. And this whole time Donald been blessed about, you know, oh i I knew your Scotch accent was phony. I knew that it was a chemical

641
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:52,930
on

642
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:54,330
The

643
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:56,570
the preferred term is

644
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:57,510
scottish.

645
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:59,070
Yeah. For scott.

646
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,350
Scratch is a drink.

647
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:09,795
Yes. I figured that was the case. I want... Not even called Scotch here. It's just whiskey. It's just whiskey. Yeah. I figured.

648
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:11,630
Alright. So,

649
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:17,330
you know, this this page really is all about the explanation and it's all about Mcdonald's blu.

650
01:01:18,505 --> 01:01:27,100
You know, the the ducks have him explain, oh, he had pretended to be knocked out pretended to be dead he was just trying to throw them off the trail.

651
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,900
He he allude to just making one

652
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:49,034
mistake. Right? He thought that he had enough time to escape when he locked him out on the battle, but, you know, he says that he should known that the kids would free themselves. In a hurry. And to me, the sub there is that he regrets not killing them, but I suspect that Barks

653
01:01:49,034 --> 01:02:02,630
didn't want to be explicit about that, you know? Yeah. Yeah. And then and then we get this nice moment where they not how clever the Nephews used were. Right? Then one of the nephew says, you know, that wouldn't have helped

654
01:02:03,047 --> 01:02:11,686
referring to, you know, locking them out further or doing something. It wouldn't have helped if they hadn't found the way into the secret tunnel and Diamond Dick says, yes.

655
01:02:12,619 --> 01:02:21,950
It took me six months to find that mo hole and new kids found it in six minutes. And Donald further blu that, you know, he wasn't around. That's why it took them so long.

656
01:02:22,604 --> 01:02:23,104
And

657
01:02:23,922 --> 01:02:27,299
and the little cap of the story is that the the Nephews

658
01:02:28,517 --> 01:02:30,115
send up their uncle Donald.

659
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:37,990
By offering him some of the fly spray and and in his very blessed array mode. He doesn't realize that it's the chemical formula.

660
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:52,619
And they closed by saying why i'm donald. We thought you knew all the time it wasn't fly spray. And that's a pretty funny image of just his lower half walking along saying. Oh shut up. That is invisible.

661
01:02:53,494 --> 01:02:54,593
Leaving his

662
01:02:54,932 --> 01:02:58,669
Barks button legs. I love how it's his

663
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:03,480
cloth half that goes invisible leaving only his Barks button legs visible.

664
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:11,720
There is a lot of a lot of people joke about how, you know, winnie the poo doesn't wear pants, Donald duck doesn't wear pants. And there's

665
01:03:12,234 --> 01:03:14,972
donald ducks bear, but... That's true. I haven't even

666
01:03:15,671 --> 01:03:28,752
like, picked up on that. You know, it's just a funny image, but it is funny when you think of it's it's the part of his body that everyone jokes about. So... Yeah. So, yeah. This is a nice a nice goofy ending to

667
01:03:29,104 --> 01:03:35,383
what again was a pretty creepy story. I I did wanna make a comment on the fly spray.

668
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:37,297
Up in the highlands

669
01:03:37,848 --> 01:03:42,233
there are these little flying biting insects called mid images. Mh.

670
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:43,969
And they

671
01:03:44,545 --> 01:03:46,994
swarm, like you wouldn't not believe.

672
01:03:47,515 --> 01:03:51,494
I mean, it's totally plausible that maybe not a fly straight, but

673
01:03:51,835 --> 01:03:52,335
some

674
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:55,066
helen So so tell me, Sarah,

675
01:03:55,922 --> 01:04:14,108
before I talk about the critical consensus, you know, I I was very eager to have you come back for this one specifically because you do live in Scotland, but also because this is a very well regarded one and the one that we read previous to this, you know, we didn't really care for it. So

676
01:04:14,606 --> 01:04:19,549
would you say Barks has redeemed himself in your eyes? Or

677
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:23,614
what did you think? You know I would I would have never

678
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:26,499
imagined that he would write something

679
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:32,619
like Volcano Valley if I had only read this one because this is a great depiction

680
01:04:32,999 --> 01:04:35,634
of a culture. It's it's not

681
01:04:36,134 --> 01:04:36,634
stereo

682
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:48,515
as much as even even the guy who is impersonating a scott is, you know, not overdo doing it or exhibiting the, like, negative traits or or

683
01:04:48,932 --> 01:04:50,268
It's not like car.

684
01:04:50,685 --> 01:04:58,637
It's not. And it's it it seems rather respectful to me. And I I did quite enjoy it. Had...

685
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:06,456
What what level of development were, like cartoons at that point. So at this point, you know, the

686
01:05:06,834 --> 01:05:08,571
the mickey and Donald cartoons

687
01:05:09,204 --> 01:05:24,751
have been huge that they were hugely popular. The ones in the early forties, you know, Barks have actually gotten his start working on it. The donald duck cartoons. That's how he got to do this. So I I think that Donald Duck has recently

688
01:05:25,368 --> 01:05:26,285
at this point,

689
01:05:26,843 --> 01:05:29,710
surpassed Mickey mouse. In terms of, like popularity,

690
01:05:30,127 --> 01:05:30,945
global popularity.

691
01:05:31,402 --> 01:05:38,816
He is probably the most popular cartoon character in the world at this point. And so these these comics are becoming

692
01:05:39,195 --> 01:05:42,891
very big on the tail of those. It felt

693
01:05:43,230 --> 01:06:07,164
not cinematic and that it was, like, grand and ethically scaled, but in that if I were to imagine this as an episode of a Duck Al part june. It wasn't the stretch that it would have been with volcano Valley. And I think it's because I've seen enough dovetail hills and I've seen enough scooby doo that I could piece together, you know, between the panels,

694
01:06:07,579 --> 01:06:10,559
what action was going on. But it it slowed

695
01:06:10,899 --> 01:06:13,359
very well. The story was engaging.

696
01:06:13,699 --> 01:06:17,694
It was creepy and kind of a way that I enjoyed even though,

697
01:06:18,394 --> 01:06:18,894
obviously,

698
01:06:19,274 --> 01:06:21,334
I'm Al skeptic by nature.

699
01:06:21,754 --> 01:06:23,294
I I did think

700
01:06:23,754 --> 01:06:24,254
a

701
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:28,895
a spray that makes you invisible except your skeleton

702
01:06:29,431 --> 01:06:29,931
shadow,

703
01:06:30,268 --> 01:06:31,844
that sounds dubious

704
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:40,639
and that's taking me out of the moment, but I could still at least shell that in a way that I couldn't show a lot of my

705
01:06:41,216 --> 01:06:42,355
disbelief Al

706
01:06:43,825 --> 01:06:49,910
what was going on in Volcano Valley because it was it wasn't just absurd. It was bad

707
01:06:50,343 --> 01:07:16,808
Right. Yeah. As far as Mac go, you know, it's definitely like, it's a bit of a stretch as I I think that it was one of my criticisms of the story was that I felt like I wanted a better explanation for why he looked like a ghost. Right? But there really wasn't. You know, there was no way around it. So as far as making up a reason and having it just be attributed to, like espionage

708
01:07:17,146 --> 01:07:24,324
and research during the war, which of course would have been, you know, World war two is very very fresh at this point.

709
01:07:24,683 --> 01:07:25,981
Right. I I think

710
01:07:26,374 --> 01:07:32,941
think there were a lot of stories that used the war as like one of their justification. So...

711
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:40,864
Even then Fa volcano Valley, they got a surplus playing from the war. Yeah. Isn't it crazy? How much of a culture

712
01:07:41,363 --> 01:07:50,034
couldn't get away from the aftermath the world war two at this point. Right? Like, it's over, but but it casts such a long shadow. Absolutely.

713
01:07:50,374 --> 01:07:51,594
Under understandably.

714
01:07:51,894 --> 01:07:59,082
Yeah. Yeah. For sure. I'm glad to hear you enjoyed this one. I I agree I think there's some, you know, really nice

715
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:09,799
development that the story is very well plotted and the mystery is for a comic, it's very well developed. You know, I when I first read this one, I kind of read it under

716
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,079
circumstances that weren't ideal

717
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:17,654
because I had missed this one for a long time and I had read most of mark's other stories

718
01:08:18,154 --> 01:08:26,109
I knew that this is one of the few remaining stories that I hadn't gotten to read yet because I was trying to seek them all out. It was probably in the last

719
01:08:26,529 --> 01:08:38,368
last ten or so of the adventure ones. And and so I was initially a little disappointed because I didn't really care for this, like Pro version of sc.

720
01:08:38,744 --> 01:08:52,374
And I I had trouble getting past that for a long time. And it's only been as I've gone back to this one to read it more without that kind of baggage that I've been able to appreciate more, you know, how creepy it is, how

721
01:08:53,111 --> 01:08:56,081
tightly plotted. It is in many ways.

722
01:08:56,856 --> 01:09:06,304
How what a good job it does of integrating some of these like, it's this neat little tour of a pretty cool version of Scotland. I'm sure there are lots of inaccuracies.

723
01:09:06,682 --> 01:09:24,679
But as far as Barks was you know, as far as he knew, writing from thousands of miles away using National Geographic Al a reference. I think this is a pretty neat representation. So this one I've really grown to appreciate it a lot more over the years. And we always like to look at the general consensus as well.

724
01:09:25,572 --> 01:09:26,391
This one is

725
01:09:27,048 --> 01:09:31,376
extremely well regarded. Now if you look on the Index website that crowds sources

726
01:09:31,873 --> 01:09:33,689
ratings, this one has an average

727
01:09:34,067 --> 01:09:38,939
rating of eight point four out of ten, which is good for a thirteenth

728
01:09:39,359 --> 01:10:04,787
out of every Disney comic story, almost forty one thousand of them. So that places us in the very, very high, like, you know, ninety nine point nine nine per percentile of of all stories or point zero zero one, I guess percentile. I do have to say to me, this one is not that great. Like it is a classic, but I wouldn't put it in that verified air. I think that it gets a little bit of kind of inflation

729
01:10:05,204 --> 01:10:17,244
from the community just because it is kind of the real origin of sc, you know, and it sets up all of this... All of these aspects of what we come to know and love about Scrooge doc.

730
01:10:17,703 --> 01:10:31,239
I do think that there is a lot to really appreciate. But I I have to imagine if this if it didn't have that kind of historical position amongst Barks stories wouldn't be rated that highly. Well, out of the two that I have read, it is number one.

731
01:10:32,176 --> 01:10:32,676
Excellent.

732
01:10:33,054 --> 01:10:35,271
Yeah. I... This would probably be

733
01:10:35,584 --> 01:10:43,718
the third or fourth favorite of mine out of the ones that I've done for this series. So that this is a very strong one. My my one criticism

734
01:10:44,175 --> 01:10:57,166
is that there's some some kind of abrupt, you know, explanation. Oh, it was diamond dick all along. Oh, it was this invisible spray. It's almost like, he he couldn't quite stick the landing for me on

735
01:10:57,662 --> 01:11:12,270
some of the resolution aspect, but there's just so many cool visuals and so much cool plotting along the way that i'll forgive some of that stuff. And you know I I'm just always a fan of anything set in scotland. I love castles.

736
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:21,079
I love creepy things, You know, the fact that there are no trees in that area is accurate. It's it it really feels

737
01:11:21,579 --> 01:11:25,014
like Britain. And and it... And then. If

738
01:11:25,513 --> 01:11:34,436
reflects back a lot of the things I love about Scotland. That's awesome. I'm I'm glad to hear that. A few more reflections on this one and some of the other appearances

739
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:38,242
I like to talk about what what seems dated or archaic.

740
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:44,125
You know, we did talk about, like some of that post worst stuff. Obviously, that's its own position and has history.

741
01:11:44,980 --> 01:12:00,070
Also that x ray machine, I pointed out that that must have looked very modern at the time, but now it looks like an antique. But I I think really actually holds up very well. You know, like you were saying, this one is not a carrot shirt. There's not really a lot that's problematic

742
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:00,970
about this.

743
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,002
You know, uncle Scrooge wield have gun

744
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:08,610
for part of the story and that's something that gets depicted a lot less

745
01:12:09,068 --> 01:12:14,194
in in modern stories, Disney is certainly shi away from that. But but in general,

746
01:12:14,571 --> 01:12:22,823
I think this actually holds up very well. And yeah. I have obviously, I have mixed feelings about guns as as

747
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:23,939
American

748
01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:30,016
living abroad in the twenty first century. The gun used in this story

749
01:12:30,354 --> 01:12:32,688
is it doesn't seem glorified

750
01:12:33,344 --> 01:12:33,844
or

751
01:12:34,262 --> 01:12:38,324
it's just... It's just another tool that Huey, using rather than high

752
01:12:39,222 --> 01:12:56,484
I have the the right that that makes that's stuff American. Well, you know, he's got... I I would agree with you, you know, I I feel I have similar feelings regarding guns to, but this feels like this feels like one of those natural times where someone might have might have brought a gun to an abandoned you know, desolate

753
01:12:56,904 --> 01:13:16,213
castle. So... And I agree it's it's kind of a... It's a tool. It's not glorified here. It doesn't seem. It is a little bit striking to me to see guns depicted in the Disney comics, but it is from an era where they were. They were used in a way that never really struck me as glorified. Right. And so

754
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:25,037
appearances and other media, you know, this is one where this is a segment where I don't usually get to say too much, but

755
01:13:25,453 --> 01:13:27,882
honestly, you could you could fill a podcast

756
01:13:28,379 --> 01:13:29,956
episode talking about appearances

757
01:13:30,293 --> 01:13:32,668
in other media because marx

758
01:13:33,205 --> 01:13:39,508
has done. He's gone back to this story for three very different oil painting.

759
01:13:39,846 --> 01:13:51,554
All of which are very, very cool. One of them is called the old castle rooms Al the same title as story. And one of them has just the best title. It's called dubious doing at dismal

760
01:13:51,934 --> 01:13:52,254
downs.

761
01:13:52,748 --> 01:13:53,248
And

762
01:13:53,665 --> 01:14:08,968
why don't you take... If if you can take a moment to look that up. It's a... I I like that oil painting a lot. It's one of my favorites that he's done. And then this, like I already alluded, Don Rose used a lot of the characters,

763
01:14:09,304 --> 01:14:12,294
the historical characters that were mentioned this one

764
01:14:13,271 --> 01:14:22,174
in his future stories to develop kind of that biography that he did have unscrew the twelve part biography called the life in times of sc Mc.

765
01:14:22,754 --> 01:14:28,934
He had some pretty key story moments set in different parts of this castle. So he references

766
01:14:29,368 --> 01:14:32,180
story a lot. Huey, did a chapter,

767
01:14:32,557 --> 01:15:01,893
a story that was called the old Castle other secret that, you know, is kind of a direct sequel a referencing this one. Oh nice. Yeah. That's a it's a pretty cool what we'll, of course have the different oil paintings shown on the on the Facebook page. Did you get to see that one dubious doing decimal downs? I do. I see it right now. Oh, and there's some heather down in the corner. The heather is kind of a the signature plant of ran moore. Heather is this

768
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:02,730
shrub

769
01:15:03,347 --> 01:15:12,494
brown plant that just Al. It... It's far as you can see. Very. No. No trees up in Rad more. And then in the late summer, it blooms

770
01:15:13,113 --> 01:15:13,613
purple.

771
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:15,367
That's a great painting.

772
01:15:15,784 --> 01:15:18,279
Oh, yeah. Barks did some really cool paintings.

773
01:15:18,696 --> 01:15:22,479
I... This is just something that fans, you know, know of, but

774
01:15:23,258 --> 01:15:29,729
Volcano Valley didn't have one associated with it. Barks had like a second career where he went back and did these oil paintings.

775
01:15:30,184 --> 01:15:33,281
That became, you know, hugely well regarded valuable

776
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:38,116
collector's items. Very well liked. I mean, it was he's almost as famous

777
01:15:38,495 --> 01:15:39,174
for his oils.

778
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:45,242
And lit the graphs of them as he is for these stories. It's it's it's so vibrant

779
01:15:45,661 --> 01:15:46,161
and

780
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:47,694
and detailed

781
01:15:48,273 --> 01:15:54,944
color wise, it's kind of it's such a contrast to the simple almost primary colors in the comics.

782
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:56,239
Yeah. Agreed. Oh,

783
01:15:57,279 --> 01:15:59,259
Ducktales has definitely referenced

784
01:15:59,599 --> 01:16:11,929
some of this, like as source material. I don't think they ever did Al episodes. Specifically on this one, but, you know, I think both runs of the show have have alluded to this comic And then as far as the educational

785
01:16:12,427 --> 01:16:12,927
value

786
01:16:13,398 --> 01:16:15,492
you know, you you've given us some awesome

787
01:16:16,267 --> 01:16:31,364
specifics regarding some of the, you know true dates and some of the cultures. So I definitely think there's some educational value and kind of an idea of that, like inner interchange between Scotland and other cultures and just some of what what North Scotland

788
01:16:31,781 --> 01:16:36,224
looks like or feels like this is this is where I learned what the word battle

789
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:36,839
meant.

790
01:16:37,733 --> 01:16:43,267
So that's that's not quite a battle. That it's more like an oreo balcony.

791
01:16:43,606 --> 01:16:54,102
The battle are generally on the roof. You generally... If you're going to go, you know, protect yourself from lower down, you just have these little slit You don't have a whole balcony.

792
01:16:54,881 --> 01:17:06,623
Let's I think are called murder holes. But the the ones on top are correlations and then the ones in the side murder. Ventilation are the the little up and down things. Well, that's fair. But...

793
01:17:06,962 --> 01:17:12,914
But yeah. It's least soon use of the term? Yeah. Yeah. That's a word that you learned.

794
01:17:14,094 --> 01:17:14,594
Exactly.

795
01:17:15,574 --> 01:17:25,809
As far as favorite panel, you know, you and I have been talking about we've we've highlighted a few panels in here already. So, you know, some of those like that depict the skeleton

796
01:17:26,669 --> 01:17:30,661
and and the castle itself look really cool. But on on this

797
01:17:31,118 --> 01:17:33,014
go through, I really liked the

798
01:17:33,392 --> 01:17:36,285
the panel that shows the Ducktales kind of hurting

799
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:37,936
what they think ci

800
01:17:38,315 --> 01:17:38,815
ghost

801
01:17:39,272 --> 01:18:03,532
to be through the through the bog and seeing that chest floating above the bot. I thought that one was pretty cool. Do you like the scare ones? Mh. I liked the ones where the kids were creeping through the the dungeons. They they sell very, you know, enclosed. You you you see the little rat that they don't see. The lighting was great. It felt properly spooky. And then

802
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:14,125
another one that stood out for me was one that I pointed out where the skeleton is chasing them with the the sword in mid air. If I were a

803
01:18:14,544 --> 01:18:15,044
younger

804
01:18:15,463 --> 01:18:18,081
child, I think that would have really

805
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:19,999
scared me because

806
01:18:20,713 --> 01:18:31,898
one skeleton scary. You know, like, there's just... We just have this primal fear of skeletons. Right And then the fact that it's facing you and you can see it, but you also

807
01:18:32,355 --> 01:18:35,367
can't see it and it can wield weapons.

808
01:18:35,864 --> 01:18:36,683
That is

809
01:18:37,061 --> 01:18:37,859
truly threatening.

810
01:18:38,392 --> 01:18:55,689
Yeah. I agree. I just... I left that. Yeah. I think you're right on. Some of those scary panels are very striking. They really they can really stay with you. Those are cool. I I also like the story of dawn the panel of Donald kind of running towards the quote camera.

811
01:18:56,102 --> 01:19:00,593
When he's got his like, rope in a la. It's just a really cool pose.

812
01:19:01,489 --> 01:19:10,899
That one I noted this time. So that's a neat one. Let's see. I'm trying to think if there is anything else that I really wanted to mention. Is there anything

813
01:19:11,635 --> 01:19:17,942
in your notes there that you really wanted to make sure to highlight before we wrap things up. It looks like I did already.

814
01:19:18,322 --> 01:19:28,769
Excellent so much. Well, I will note really quickly that this out of the episodes that we've done on the podcast so far on index, this one is the second highest rated by the community.

815
01:19:29,289 --> 01:19:31,108
Only Al venture down under

816
01:19:31,422 --> 01:19:40,857
rated higher. But this one is very strong. This is a this is a classic, and I think it definitely deserves to be remembered. Sarah, I really appreciate you joining us again.

817
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:45,237
Hope to have you back for another. I'll have to figure out another one that

818
01:19:45,672 --> 01:19:56,056
we could have some fun with this point. They're so easy for me to read that as long as it's, you know, not gonna make me hate to love it or love to hate it. I'm down for anything.

819
01:19:56,433 --> 01:19:58,407
That's great to hear. Good.

820
01:19:58,784 --> 01:20:00,653
Well, I hope that
