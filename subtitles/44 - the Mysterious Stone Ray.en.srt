1
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,495
We can have

2
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:37,825
Hello, and welcome to Barks remarks. The podcast where we talk about the stories from the legendary Carl Barks creator of Scrooge Inducks and writer an artist of the greatest Donald and Scrooge comments of all time. Join us as we explore his longer adventure stories in their chronological

3
00:00:38,163 --> 00:01:01,911
publishing order. We'll talk about what makes them so enduring their historical context and how well they hold up today. So get out your reprint and get ready to enjoy our remarks. Welcome back to Barks remarks, I'm Barks Sever a Grown man who enjoys Inducks con and I'm joined by a returning guest host sad, why don't you introduce yourself? Yeah. I'm thank mer.

4
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,447
I am a long time Ducktales,

5
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:07,085
specifically of Carl Barks.

6
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:15,284
I've done a lot of commentary for the Fan graphics collections, and I've also done a lot of localization work for the various

7
00:01:15,623 --> 00:01:18,574
new publications of international stories.

8
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:25,390
Very cool. Yeah. I I really enjoy having people on who've got some of the behind the scenes. It experience.

9
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:31,270
You know, you get to see kinda how the sausage is made. That must be interesting. Yeah. It can be.

10
00:01:32,662 --> 00:01:33,600
Sometimes it's very

11
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:34,995
eliminating

12
00:01:35,372 --> 00:01:39,937
how these things are made or... How they're not made in some cases.

13
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:48,869
And you know, I guess that's appropriate too because the the story that we're gonna be talking about today, which is of course, the mysterious

14
00:01:49,383 --> 00:01:57,420
stone ray. Definitely had some like behind the scenes not drama. None of it's, like too exciting, but but rarely

15
00:01:57,838 --> 00:02:01,584
for a Karl Barks comment. We kinda get to see

16
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,119
some of the, like,

17
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,613
revisions and rev

18
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:12,011
in how he made this one? Yes. It's fast naming that all that survived

19
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:18,187
because so much from the period is long gone. And it sort of says to me that Barks

20
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:28,735
wasn't really sure of how this story should go. And I'm not sure if we see much of that in the final project, but it's very eliminating seeing those alternate

21
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:39,667
pay that do survive Right. And and what we're referring to, of course is that there is this, like, surviving or that ultimately didn't make it into the story.

22
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:41,604
It's it's nearly

23
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:57,587
complete. Right? Like, it's it's drawn, but not fully or something is my understanding? A couple of them are ink. I'm looking at it right now, the Fan Graphics collect right now. It looks like there's at least a page worth that's inked

24
00:02:58,004 --> 00:02:59,620
and the other is cancelled

25
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:03,502
and I'm gonna read what Barks said

26
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:04,955
yeah. You don't mind.

27
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:16,975
He said Barks said do, Bruce Hamilton, Jeffrey Bloom and tom. Andre in nineteen eighty four, he said, I cut panels to shorten business, which was getting tire assembly overs stage.

28
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:25,980
And it says he may have been planning this as a thirty two page story and got a word part way through that he had to cut it to twenty eight pages.

29
00:03:26,394 --> 00:03:45,672
May have been a bit of both, but you can... As they say, you can see Barks storytelling sense Al work. Yeah. It's it's almost like you got to see his notes. Or or thought process or something for this one. Right? Because he he he did a lot of work that ultimately he left out, and it's not like back to the

30
00:03:46,011 --> 00:04:08,399
where they could go back in and put it in later because it's... He reworked the story. It's not. Yeah. It's it's it I would I would definitely go towards Barks as and explanation that he thought he was overs staging it. I would definitely... I I would I don't think he got that, you know, the hammer came down from the western office

31
00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:28,359
in this case betty he had to cut stuff, but he was just doing it himself. He was doing self editing Right. Yeah. This seems like him a case of him just just trying to be disciplined about how again, as you said, how he stages it. And and I like... I like how the the more recent printing have chosen

32
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:33,519
to just kinda tag along the extra panels. You know, they're not trying to show.

33
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:39,881
No. No. That's the way... And that's the way it should be because there's no way to incorporate it

34
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:55,144
just like with the trick treat. They print that all... They print it ultimately. They either run Barks. They run Barks as are intended edition. And in the back they'll run the sense the sensor version or the Al. Be the published version.

35
00:04:55,601 --> 00:05:08,081
So it's it would be. Right. It's it's a nice way of kinda having your cake and eating it too. Mh. It works out pretty well. Mh. So let's see. So the mysterious stone ray, we you and I were talking beforehand,

36
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:11,248
Right. And and I I mentioned

37
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:16,608
that, you know, this is not really one of my favorite marks stories.

38
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:22,949
But but you are a pretty big fan of this one. I am I've I've always liked this one. I've

39
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,502
I first read it... There was

40
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:31,696
many years ago with my father on. I was a kid. There was a comic books in Toronto,

41
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,752
called dragon lady Comics, and they basically had a gold mine for me, like,

42
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:52,319
maybe circuit age thirteen or fourteen, but, like, they had, like, the whole Gladstone and Disney comics run and they're long boxes in the back of the store, you know, for sale. And, yeah, this one I picked up

43
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,759
and the

44
00:05:54,419 --> 00:06:03,247
the eighties lights don't reprint. That's where I first read it and it old files Scrooge two twenty two I yep. Yeah. With that beautiful

45
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:06,156
cover Yeah if yeah. And...

46
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:08,468
No. It just stuck out to me.

47
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:17,659
I kind of go against the grain. I know you said you were excited about the early uncle Scrooge you getting into. And I can see the excitement for those.

48
00:06:18,153 --> 00:06:30,393
But I'm general... I generally go against the worldwide grain and think that the uncle Scrooge stories generally aren't Carl Barks as best work. I do think that the first three stories

49
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:31,632
that he did

50
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:39,284
and when it was just a four color, and it wasn't the ongoing Scrooge series. I think those are un past.

51
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:48,269
Right. I I would I would rank those and if if I top three, it would be in that order because they have an energy that none of the other stories matched

52
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:49,069
and

53
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:53,034
I can sort of see why this one would be un memorable

54
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:58,177
and the earliest stories because this one doesn't have a lot of the spectacle

55
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:03,659
doesn't have a lot of the Grand here, you know, the the fantastic settings like

56
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:05,934
the seven cities or T

57
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:07,171
or glen

58
00:07:07,884 --> 00:07:08,384
and

59
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:14,058
it doesn't dig deep into screws lower. Like those first three stories did. But

60
00:07:14,437 --> 00:07:36,279
I always like this one. I think you I always I always like it because it's very creepy. It's a very creepy story. It doesn't start off normally, like one does, I mean, I mean, the beagle boys are initially not the the main villain of the story. They're petrified. They're trapped on the island. Petrified and in a in both cents I guess. Exactly.

61
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,400
Exactly.

62
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,400
And I don't know I I I would definitely rate it above the

63
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:46,241
whatever It got chris and Hawaiian holiday or whatever it is. Oh

64
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:50,480
honey mystery? Yeah. Man mystery. Yeah. That one always just

65
00:07:51,097 --> 00:08:21,628
I was kinda... It struck me as a mis fire when I read it as a kid. I I might have to re reread it again, but That one's pretty divisive. I'm I'm finding. I do like, some some people love it, and some people really if not hate it, they I did probably agree with you that it's a miss fine. I sure don't hate it, but it's... The the big boys are truly the terrible, terrible big boys I'm that one. Yeah. That not maybe what what I like about it. I kinda like the degradation

66
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:29,617
in that one Oh boy. But the Inducks have to to overcome. But but... Yeah, it's interesting to think about these this first

67
00:08:29,954 --> 00:08:49,863
collection. The the first... I don't know the ten first ten or so screwed story is it's it's a random number, but it's a round number, so it's easy to kinda think of them together. And as you say those first handful are like unmatched setting up screws lower. They have some really deep themes and then even even up to, like, trial a lot, you know, is

68
00:08:50,574 --> 00:08:53,904
kind of along those lines. And then that, like, second.

69
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:59,367
Of ten. We're we're just we're kind of getting into good

70
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:00,578
solid

71
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:03,287
adventure stories. Well, it's

72
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:05,677
it's funny. The first ten is

73
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:13,039
that that's the cutoff off point the after the first ten Scrooge issues, that's when the letter changes, and that's when generally,

74
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:16,315
I agree. It's it's the general consensus

75
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:32,555
that's when Barks started selecting. Glen his wife took over the lettering. Well, I mean, it... It's it's, I think probably just a matter of consists and see. Right? You got some... You get some really stand out classics Sure course. But you also get these big, like,

76
00:09:33,448 --> 00:10:04,826
swings, these peaks and trough. But Right But Barks being Barks. There's... I think always something to like really appreciate. Oh, of gosh. And and again, this one, I I do enjoy this. I just I don't love it, and I think I really I came into it really wanting to love it for a few reasons that we'll get into sure. So what that's kinda... I think the dynamic that we've got going into this podcast. Right? And that be fun explore little little bit of background.

77
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:08,290
We we've mentioned that this is an early uncle Scrooge

78
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:10,385
specifically we're uncle

79
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:11,720
number eight.

80
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:14,812
This one is a bit of a shorter

81
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:22,715
story, where I guess it's it's kind of like what is gonna end up being the average length of his adventures.

82
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,590
Right. I recently recorded an un

83
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:33,025
an for secret of Al, which I I realized was his very last full length thirty two pager.

84
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:38,945
So it's it's interesting to think that going forward this twenty four pages is kind of the norm.

85
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:57,450
This one was released cover date was December of fifty four. I I would say this one doesn't have... It... It hasn't been reprinted. As often as many of the early uncle Scrooge adventures. It's it's only at eight in the Us counting the original print

86
00:10:57,988 --> 00:11:00,204
So it feels a little bit under

87
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:01,720
exposed. And

88
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:05,391
like a bunch of his stories, right? You mentioned

89
00:11:05,744 --> 00:11:06,244
that

90
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:16,120
Hawaiian hide away was kind of the working title for a while for what fans eventually landed at being the men who miss history. Some of these very early

91
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,690
stories. For one reason or another Western did not run them with a title. So there's this cool bit of correspondence

92
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:32,272
between Barks and a family named Malcolm Will. Mh. Where he asked him to suggest some titles for this one. And the

93
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:36,861
title that I originally read this under, I guess you did too

94
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,226
was message from ast mysterious islands.

95
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:43,337
Mh. That... And that's what Bark had suggested.

96
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:48,379
But eventually, we landed at the mysterious Stone. Right? What do you like better?

97
00:11:49,117 --> 00:11:52,734
I like mysterious Stone Ray. I I think that's okay.

98
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:56,425
You know, it's just funny is that as

99
00:11:56,845 --> 00:12:00,785
so many of these were printed without a title. So it's honestly,

100
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:08,600
I could just generally go by what Barks officially settled on. Yeah. I mean, I I kinda like that they hide,

101
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:23,500
you know, that that little element of the story. I guess you get it in the cover if you're looking at the One. But just like Hawaiian hide way, I I actually preferred that one I think message from the mysterious Island does a good job of bearing the lead

102
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,848
a little bit. Let's see. You did a nice job already about talking

103
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,535
about the the

104
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:36,688
revisions that he made just a little bit of kinda of random trivia.

105
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:41,700
You you mentioned the b boy. This is a very big heavy

106
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:51,464
story. And I do think that's a thing to to appreciate about this one. Right? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes. The b boys they're becoming

107
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:53,378
very more defined

108
00:12:54,075 --> 00:13:20,628
and there's an important character trade introduced in the story but I I think we'll save that for when we actually get it. Because I think everyone who knows this knows these stories knows what we're talking about. And so I don't... I don't wanna spoil it ahead of time. Sure. That sounds good to me. Yeah. Let's save right for when it shows up. So before we get into the story, I'm gonna briefly hand to some of our international listeners

109
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:24,160
by noting some of the titles from around the world.

110
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:31,345
And and, you know, that these aren't too remarkable they're kinda what you'd would expect. But just a couple of them are fun.

111
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,574
Denmark, we have Uncle Y kim Ogden Garlic professor,

112
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:44,455
which is screws in the man profess sir. Oh, boy Let's see. Italy has a pretty conventional theo pepperoni

113
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:46,052
del

114
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,985
which is uncle Scrooge and the Cabbage Islands.

115
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,829
Oh, Got one. Oh yeah.

116
00:13:52,985 --> 00:14:00,372
I'd might prefer that the Barks this title. Sure. Yeah. There's something for that. And then we've found kind of a Da one from Germany,

117
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:02,227
d or dump.

118
00:14:02,804 --> 00:14:08,541
That's one of those, like German words where it's one word, and it translates to the Cabbage

119
00:14:08,878 --> 00:14:12,745
steam island. Mh So I like... I like how they manage that.

120
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:18,896
Alright. So So let's do it then. Let's let's launch into this story.

121
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:26,824
I'm gonna... I'm gonna summarize each page, we're not gonna cover everything every every gruesome some detail, but

122
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:29,456
we're gonna highlight stuff that we find

123
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:31,904
interesting and and notable.

124
00:14:32,442 --> 00:14:36,697
And so so the mysterious stone ray opens

125
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:37,736
in

126
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:44,605
kind of a unique manner. Right? We've got... We've got this little subversion where Scrooge is doing his typical

127
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:54,760
pursuit. He's diving through the money and has bin but you can tell that his heart is just not in it. Mh. You know. He's he's talking about

128
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,600
He's naming his fortune that. This is one of those...

129
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,733
I'm gonna I'm gonna start to track these because this is... I think, second example

130
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:08,726
where he labels his fortune.

131
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,520
And in Min

132
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,650
history, he gave Donald

133
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:22,005
described it as being this pretty round number, but here he calls it five billion quadruple till on two and Al

134
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:23,635
fantastic

135
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:24,454
and

136
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:26,272
Tilt san

137
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:29,049
billion dollars and sixteen cents.

138
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:32,866
Of course. We've always got the sixteen cents. Mh

139
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:51,740
But he's just kind of one about it. He's very, like, half hearted and he's talking about how the side of his vast fortune doesn't share him up I get used to. And so by by the end of the first page, he's already resolved that he needs to go see a doctor

140
00:15:52,160 --> 00:16:10,876
to figure out what is wrong. So, yes. It's a very good hook. You know, It captures the reader. You know, he's doing his usual money swim routine, but, you know, he's very lack of day about it. And we want as a reader wanna know well, what's causing screws this? Yeah. It's definitely

141
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:11,653
intriguing.

142
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:15,165
And on the next page we transition very quickly

143
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:17,005
into the doctor's office.

144
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:19,940
This doctor is not one of the quack

145
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,400
that Barks

146
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,940
sometimes poor.

147
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:34,729
Right? Mh. We don't have any, like, goofy site gag about him being being class. And and screws is explaining that he feels tired and heavy at times.

148
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:39,996
Something that we can relate to. Right? Of course. This a universal

149
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:46,683
kind of feeling and and probably, you know, what we're meant to think of screws is an old man. Too. Mh.

150
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:51,651
And and and again, very quick pacing here. The doctor

151
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:55,258
immediately looks at him with the magnifying glass

152
00:16:55,877 --> 00:16:58,055
uses me. And and he

153
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:03,030
explains no wonder. Your skin is the full of gold dust.

154
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:09,585
And any... He goes on to explain that it's actually clogged his pores.

155
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:16,640
He's not getting any event ventilation and And this is this is gonna be a good one of the better gag

156
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,280
of the story, right? Is someone

157
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,080
expressing

158
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:31,513
surprise and how how on Earth could this happen to you? Do you like roll and money? Yeah. It's... Yes It's someone's actually calling this out like, I...

159
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:46,544
What are you insane? Are you are you just rolling around and and gold and Scrooge, of course, is you know, what it... What is this daily routine is getting embarrassed by by being called out on it. And I've gotta say too that This shows how much more

160
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:48,658
Barks respected is audience

161
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:52,207
because you would not see something like this than one of the other

162
00:17:52,664 --> 00:17:56,215
Western comic books. By the other authors and Kurt

163
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:58,735
because skin ventilation,

164
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:00,975
that's not a topic that

165
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:10,864
I can't think of a single other story. Yeah. You you can definitely tell that he like really thought about this hook and how to make this element were.

166
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:19,357
And and so the doctor, you know, gives him a remedy, he tells him that he needs to go to get ras, basically somewhere windy

167
00:18:20,426 --> 00:18:33,302
where, you know, it can just kind of brush the gold out and stop plugging his pores. And And so Scrooge kinda resolves in his mind that the the compromise is to take a few minutes Al the beach

168
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:43,182
and who let him air himself out And and that, I really enjoy this goofy panel of him kinda holding open his broad cloth and just

169
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:44,021
getting

170
00:18:44,614 --> 00:18:49,083
getting some breeze. It's silly. It's it's... It looks very pleasant. Mh.

171
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:56,630
Yes. And this is a the dilemma we've all faced. I think those of us... Those of us in the working world. We

172
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,670
kind of

173
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,210
sometimes sacrifice our health and well being for the sake of work.

174
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:04,845
And it actually makes Scrooge a little sympathetic

175
00:19:05,225 --> 00:19:14,853
until he turns it around. It says, oh, I would take a sea voyage if I could see some way of making a little money on the trip. Say, okay. Now you're back to mick doc and

176
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:30,464
not not quite as that is, you worked just a panel or two ago. Right. Because he's gonna constantly be scheming how to make or save money on on the ultimate voyage. Mh. And and again, it's a shorter story

177
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:40,875
so we're already into the third page. He's He's moving it along. Scrooge sees his nephews doing some beach coming, and I old fashion

178
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:48,557
pursuit. And Huey, dewey and, Louie. And you know, I think it's interesting that he's got them there without Donald. Right? We don't

179
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:59,068
necessarily see that too often in the adventure stories. Right. They explained that they've noticed a bottle is drifting in on the tide and they're waiting for it to come in because,

180
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:02,297
you know, the What what does everyone know about bottles?

181
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,235
Sometimes they have messages.

182
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:27,715
Mh. And I and I love how Scrooge sees down. He's it's he's got this screen expression on face. I'll join them. I one's found a Chinese penny that way. This why I like the... I this is why I really love this story is because there's little character beats and flourish like that. Like, he's it's not interested in going to see his nephews for the sake that they're just his family he's...

183
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:35,360
He got... He got some money that one time seeing what they were up to. I mean and that's why he's that's what drives him the run over

184
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:39,387
Right. Like you say, every character beat is reinforced.

185
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:47,538
On the other hand, I do like how he's kinda taking his nephews serious. Right like, they see this thing. They're they're being very.

186
00:20:49,034 --> 00:21:04,652
And he's right along there with them. Right? He's smiling as they watch it come in. And then when he sees that when they realized there is something in that bottle, of course, he gets very excited, pondering, maybe it's a map to Blue blueberry yeah pressure. Yeah. Yeah.

187
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,688
For. But we learn in fact that it is an

188
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:09,827
Sos

189
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:11,305
which says

190
00:21:11,818 --> 00:21:18,418
Save me. I am a maroon on an uncharted island at about one two one thirty West latitude

191
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:19,534
twenty

192
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:43,658
south. And this is just kat to, like, junior wood chips. Right? Because they configure this, they can figure this out. Right. So on on the next page, you know, they they talk about this message, which is clearly referring to an un uncharted island where someone is in trouble. The message goes on to say approach island only from Southwest

193
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:50,425
to avoid being turned into you. And unfortunately, the rest of the message is blurred by water.

194
00:21:50,765 --> 00:22:06,770
Mh. So that... That's what a neat little message, right? Or a neat little hook because it seems very realistic that the message could be don't, you know, avoid being turned into the the reef or something like that. But if you've seen the title, you probably know what it's referring to. Mh.

195
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:07,728
Mh.

196
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:18,115
This is why I like the story is creepy and for building. The whole... The message you're getting blurred. It's actually a very dire warning as well as

197
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,090
you know, Al sos

198
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,970
and it also

199
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,170
addresses,

200
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:23,870
you know,

201
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:33,865
what some of us readers might think of his common sense. It's like, well, why don't they call the navy or go to the cops about this? You know? And

202
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:40,460
of course, Barks answers that immediately. It's Scrooge just pure agreed Right. Screws

203
00:22:40,956 --> 00:22:47,097
imagination is racing that, you know, it's an un uncharted island it could have lots of riches.

204
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:57,924
And and you're right, he's doing a nice job of, like, filling in potential plot holes. Here. Mh. But before he races off with his family to to rescue

205
00:22:58,261 --> 00:23:05,365
the the poor sale slash look for riches, he verifies with the police. He asks

206
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:13,780
about if there's been any news of the legal boys. And he learns that they left the country months ago. So he's reassured himself

207
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,880
because he wouldn't wanna leave his bin un bombarded with those crooks around. Mh.

208
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,524
Yes and that's an interesting tidbit he drops.

209
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:27,447
It kind of tells you that the big boys are gonna be involved in the story in some capacity

210
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,796
because Bark doesn't just put in things for no reason.

211
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:32,494
Right. Definitely.

212
00:23:33,193 --> 00:23:39,019
So we we get again, it's It's a very brisk paste for this adventure.

213
00:23:39,596 --> 00:23:40,096
Bark

214
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:51,622
introduces donald to the story and in just the little narration box. On the next page. Right? He is added to the crew and the downey rescue a sale on the morning tide.

215
00:23:52,715 --> 00:24:03,788
I do really like the panels again that show Scrooge airing himself out while he's ten. Oh, yes. And part the best... Yes. I love one

216
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:05,405
Barks draws those eyes.

217
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:10,040
It's it's a very goofy picture. And it's also a way of Scrooge

218
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:13,626
getting out of the work. Right, that the

219
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:16,896
requires. Because he's like, hey, Ducktales orders.

220
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:20,900
I need to air myself out but Donald

221
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:29,675
explains that, you know, he needs to steer the boat and each of the boys has their own task Mh. And Scrooge kinda like

222
00:24:30,255 --> 00:24:35,775
shrubs. Okay. So... And Donald snaps it and somebody has to cut. Mh.

223
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:42,912
It's kind of a unique exchange. I don't usually see screws giving that kind of a sc. And so he

224
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:46,320
Al down into the galley.

225
00:24:46,694 --> 00:25:00,462
And this is where we're going to be introduced to an element of the story that I meant to bring up before. I forgot I forgot to ask you about So we we get to talk here about habits

226
00:25:01,997 --> 00:25:09,160
can I ask you, can I just kinda d a little bit is this like a cli that you know about?

227
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:13,509
The idea of, like, boiled cabbage being

228
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:17,536
super stink. Well, it's... Well, it's obviously something

229
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:19,769
Barks is employing because

230
00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:21,802
cabbage is notoriously

231
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,093
cheap food to cook need.

232
00:25:25,112 --> 00:25:26,771
And it's sort of invoking

233
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,589
Scrooge

234
00:25:28,548 --> 00:25:36,953
Scottish heritage because it's, you know, it's it's an irish dish course corned a beef cabbage, but it's probably something they ate and that neck of the woods too a lot.

235
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:43,405
And the this panel is like, this Al be the cheapest dinner any ships crew is ever eaten.

236
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:53,405
And he's saying it with such pride. It's it's it's lament, but it it's is it's really funny. Two tons of cabbage because it was only two cents a pound.

237
00:25:54,203 --> 00:25:59,184
Right. So Scrooge has stocked their Al with nothing but habits.

238
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:08,118
This this always felt like such a strange element to this because, like, I didn't know about this plus. The idea that

239
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:14,450
people eat boiled cabbage first, and that it's super stink. But like, when I Googled

240
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:22,540
res researching, you get times of stuff about, like, how to remove the smell of boiled cabbage from your house.

241
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:27,345
So I... All I can think of, that this is, like, probably,

242
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:29,020
you know, in my household,

243
00:26:29,516 --> 00:26:30,415
this is not.

244
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:33,086
But it was probably pretty popular

245
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:34,375
in America

246
00:26:35,113 --> 00:26:41,075
around this time. And I can remember other references and, like, even bark stories

247
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:50,026
and and other, like, pop culture of the time that talks about this. So I I guess that it like releases a sulfur

248
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:50,944
smell

249
00:26:52,454 --> 00:26:56,422
just a little bit too long or yeah. Especially if you're

250
00:26:56,918 --> 00:26:58,553
being as frugal as Scrooge

251
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,448
and, yeah, it's

252
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:09,190
it can be quite a disgusting aroma. Right. So I'll I'll definitely take your and the Internet's word for it. I've never smelled boiled cabbage.

253
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:14,411
But this is gonna be some of this is gonna be one of the big running gag

254
00:27:14,828 --> 00:27:15,966
of the story

255
00:27:16,662 --> 00:27:27,440
and and we're we're throwing together boiled cabbage along with the c journey. So, you know, we get... We get the Nephews basically re over the edge of the lowest at the end of the page.

256
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:35,928
And the next page is really about just the the rest of the journey. There's there's nothing too eventful as the Nephews

257
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:45,042
as Scrooge and the nephews approached the island. Mh. There's a couple more funny references to the fact that they're eating nothing but cabbage on the way and they

258
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:53,616
I do like the exchange where the nephews say think of think of being rescued by by someone who has nothing to eat, but cabbage.

259
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,528
Mh. And so they do

260
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:57,367
eventually

261
00:27:57,866 --> 00:28:03,060
arrive at the island. They get a good view. What do you think that of the the view of the island there?

262
00:28:04,153 --> 00:28:04,653
See.

263
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:06,668
It's very non Scrooge.

264
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:08,126
It just seems

265
00:28:08,823 --> 00:28:12,157
on it just seems very ordinary. And

266
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:19,981
of course, as we'll see, there's nothing at all ordinary about this island. So it's a good bait and switch and Barks

267
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:34,933
and Bark as part. Yeah I've gotta say that first view looks pretty una assuming. Like said. So they do take care. You know, to to listen to them notes warning and they approach it from the Southwest

268
00:28:35,272 --> 00:28:36,150
side. Right.

269
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:41,130
But they see that there's nothing that looks like a natural harbor.

270
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:42,783
So they, you know,

271
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:52,010
make themselves ready to go shore as carefully as they can. And we we get reminded again that Scrooge is really all about the prospecting

272
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,802
because he brings a whole outfit with him. Mh.

273
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,740
And,

274
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:13,132
you know, there's, I guess the end of the story or the end of this page kinda adds to that, like, ominous field that you're talking about. Mh. Right, where the nephews are talking Do you do you mind reading us the Nephews exchange at the end of this page. Yeah.

275
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:23,380
One of them says it's strange the maroon sailor or has shown up to welcome us. Maybe he smelled us to come and hit. And it's it's a funny exchange, but it's also...

276
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,620
Yeah. Where where's is this guy that's been trying to be rescued

277
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:34,288
Right. It definitely plants that seed of, like, everything is not quite right in in the reader.

278
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:39,352
And and so Scrooge Donald are the two that go,

279
00:29:40,686 --> 00:29:45,785
and Scrooge initially thinks that he's found a golden nugget get only to have it be a brass button

280
00:29:46,605 --> 00:29:54,197
And they realized that they've got a... They're gonna have to look in some of these the caves that are in this kind of cliff face.

281
00:29:54,774 --> 00:29:57,507
And so Donald and sc

282
00:29:58,403 --> 00:30:07,927
split up And again, Fad, do you wanna kinda tell us about the... What happens the end of this page. Yeah. There's a... Yes. We're not kept in too much suspense.

283
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,830
Anyone who's rad uncle Scrooge Story can tell who that is and so silhouette.

284
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,690
It's Donald looking in a cave calling for someone in there. And

285
00:30:18,285 --> 00:30:27,859
it's definitely a big boy about to tie them up. Yeah. You're in you're right, it's not like it's not a big mystery, but it is a very, like, sp

286
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:28,895
staged

287
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:32,782
panel, I think. I I do think this is really effective. Mh.

288
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,905
And it's weird to see a beagle boy by himself. Friday.

289
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:43,305
Yeah. You've seen them enough times to know that B boys are always plural. Yes.

290
00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:55,952
And and on to the next page, we get this kind of rare instance of, like, the perspective shifting to the b, we see his thought balloon as he's subdue Donald.

291
00:30:56,488 --> 00:31:00,470
He's thinking to himself, the kids on that boat will be neck

292
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:07,190
and he also thinks I've got reasons for wanting to manage my rescue myself.

293
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,365
And we get this pretty cool sinister

294
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:12,559
approach where he

295
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:15,330
start the nephews. Mh.

296
00:31:16,088 --> 00:31:21,553
Claims on board, they say, oh, my grandfather's ghost. It's a big boy.

297
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,805
And I I really like their, like,

298
00:31:25,962 --> 00:31:26,462
confrontation.

299
00:31:27,695 --> 00:31:29,155
Do you wanna tell us about it?

300
00:31:29,535 --> 00:31:32,675
Yeah. It's it's a it's pretty terrifying. It's

301
00:31:33,175 --> 00:31:40,966
it's it's the one big boy practically str to kids for several panels trying to throw them overboard into the ocean,

302
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:46,615
and they're bay... They're begging... They're act... They're actively begging him do not

303
00:31:47,353 --> 00:31:48,551
them. It's... Yeah.

304
00:31:49,349 --> 00:31:54,890
Again, these early stories, they're truly terrible, terrible legal boys, and it's a nice

305
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:13,827
inclusion of the cabbage again as one of the nephews to tax the legal boy with it and maxim cold and enough long enough to be subdued. Right. It's it's weird that cabbage would cause that much damage, but we'll go with it. Right. I I do like it. Because you're right. It is very...

306
00:32:14,484 --> 00:32:22,000
It's very frightening. You know, the way he's trying to toss them overboard and they're pleading. The steaks do feel really high there.

307
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:27,900
And so, you know, the Nephews figure out, hey, if there's one beetle here, there's

308
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,828
uncle Scrooge must be in trouble because there's gonna be more beagle on the island. Mh.

309
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:38,715
And so we flash back two Scrooge

310
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:41,615
on the island, and he is pondering.

311
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:47,950
He's still looking for gold, but he's thinking... I'll surely find some rare stones.

312
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:56,490
Yes. Yes. Good use of language there by Barks. Yeah. You tell us this is where Well does turn creepy.

313
00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:58,803
Yeah. And he finds all these

314
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:00,122
petrified

315
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,276
stone animals. He's a turtle, he sees a bird.

316
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:11,350
Cock two with which you can pick up by the tail. Yeah. That's what... I feel believe that's what grace that get discover.

317
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,890
Very for bold.

318
00:33:13,245 --> 00:33:17,665
And screws just estates off and he's Severino more and more on max page

319
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:20,145
wildlife that's petrified fried

320
00:33:20,525 --> 00:33:21,545
butterflies, monkeys,

321
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:22,440
and

322
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,175
What's great is a a pack of four beagle boys scheming,

323
00:33:27,815 --> 00:33:28,315
and

324
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:34,058
completely petrified. And as Scrooge says, carved b no no. That's caring realism too far.

325
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:38,307
Right? Because he's he's initially thought it must be carved.

326
00:33:38,804 --> 00:33:44,503
But now he's realizing there's gotta be something else. Going on. And any calls for Donald

327
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,935
saying that he must be having a nightmare

328
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:49,347
and tell him about what he saw.

329
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,221
And Donald says,

330
00:33:51,715 --> 00:33:55,427
He says I just saw a whole row of stone beetle boys.

331
00:33:56,066 --> 00:34:12,903
Donald gets off a good line here. He says I'm not surprised, the one that hit me must have been solid granite. Mh. Yes. And the next page we're back with the nephews and the subdued legal boy tied up This is a bit of exposition that explaining the situation.

332
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:21,320
Right It's... It is kind of... And this is where I I liked it. It's creepy because the beagle boys are victims here too. Well,

333
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:33,426
not so much because as he explains, they came to the island to pill yet. And you know, so not too... Not too many tiers shed for them. But Right.

334
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,051
You know, they ran into bad trouble and

335
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:38,486
talking about

336
00:34:38,824 --> 00:34:51,540
martian or whatever they are up there turned ray on us. I was the only one who escaped and he he explains the whole situation to them, and it turns out they believe him right away because he...

337
00:34:51,957 --> 00:35:03,731
He corroborate the story about the bottle and what the message said. Right. And he also tells them about his fellow beagle and one of the Nephews is able to see them through the bin.

338
00:35:05,343 --> 00:35:12,555
And there's... It really does do a good job of ramping up the anxiety by you know, the beetle boy has this really

339
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:13,911
desperate

340
00:35:14,568 --> 00:35:17,561
expression that I think. Works very well for this.

341
00:35:18,692 --> 00:35:22,104
And so the Nephews head out to the island

342
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:23,380
to worn

343
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:37,162
and donald all but but I'm I'm gonna mention I I was struck by the Beagle description here. When I re re reread this, you know, the most recent time. I was thinking that this reminded me

344
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:44,353
the mention of martian and array. That sounded kinda like the war of the world. Yeah. That that absolutely

345
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,120
would have been on

346
00:35:46,618 --> 00:35:49,668
Barks is mine, especially at the time because...

347
00:35:50,164 --> 00:36:01,165
But that movie was just released in nineteen fifty three and you know, that would have been on Barks is mine. He would have seen that. He would heard about it, and might have incorporated that into a story.

348
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:23,961
Right. And and I think the book was in, like the... I think it was in the thirties. Yeah. Of course. And Barks would have read it then too. But I'm just thinking of the the the film would have Jocelyn is... Jessica's his interest and, oh, well, maybe I can do a story with some elements of this. Yeah. No doubt. Like, it definitely, I think help to enter pop culture.

349
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,146
I haven't... I can't remember seeing the movie. I think that's the one where it's a very static looking

350
00:36:31,446 --> 00:36:31,946
robot

351
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:36,366
kind of fires beams from his hands. Am I remembering that Right?

352
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:43,681
I you might be... I I'm embarrassed to say Al an all move stuff. I don't remember it much. Because.

353
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,255
Sci f is not my forte k. I know enough that

354
00:36:47,794 --> 00:36:56,748
that's... That's probably what was on his mind. I just... I am a little familiar with the book and I remember that, like, the the creatures

355
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:14,241
in the book. To me, they really do vote we're what we're gonna see later. So. Well, this... Well, it's around this time where a lot of the more... The what what you would call the classic era of sci f fe is really becoming prominent pop

356
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:27,319
and, you know, it's starting to influence Barks. This is... Yeah. This is his first side f type of story that... But, you know, it really isn't in so much. But because it's not so much natural as it is,

357
00:37:27,658 --> 00:37:27,857
you know,

358
00:37:29,055 --> 00:37:30,313
one of Ge Gear

359
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:41,383
lost relations doing something. I I think that's a good point. I think that really Barks, you know, mentioned that this is one of the the first of these, like, really sci

360
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:43,035
influenced adventures.

361
00:37:43,453 --> 00:37:43,653
Mh.

362
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:51,836
So, you know, the next segment is really all about the... All the characters coming together on the island.

363
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,105
The nephews have to take the beagle

364
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:59,981
tied up so that he won't try and steal boat. And they encounter screws and donald.

365
00:38:00,635 --> 00:38:10,341
About to crest the hill, because donald wants to show the Scrooge wants to show Donald, those stone b boys but the nephews worn them off

366
00:38:10,641 --> 00:38:11,141
explaining

367
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:15,196
about the gang of martian up there with the ray that will patch

368
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:23,200
and screws, you know, he's been up there already and and nothing happened to him So he's extremely skeptical call.

369
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:43,277
And and he goes up there and he looks around the nephews are are pleading with him telling them them about the beagle that saw buddies turned into stone. Now sc realizes that they're really are big boys on the islands and the... And he takes an advantage of the stone beetle boys. Mh.

370
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:46,274
Yes. He decides to kick one in the behind.

371
00:38:46,754 --> 00:38:50,066
Because brother, what it chance to even a lot of old scores

372
00:38:50,684 --> 00:38:57,986
Right before see he swear he broken his foot now. And he calls to his nephews that it's perfectly safe.

373
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:00,015
But on the next page

374
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:06,052
turns out it's not quite so safe because donald than the two nephews that cross over the ledge,

375
00:39:06,865 --> 00:39:08,324
they're immediately petrified.

376
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:10,401
It rights with a big

377
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:21,316
z It's a it's a cool little sound affected. It's cool. It it's definitely creepy. Right? Severino them seeing them turns to stone. Absolutely.

378
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:23,165
And and so on the next

379
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:27,281
the next segment, we transitioned to, you know, sc

380
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,480
sobbing

381
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:29,399
about

382
00:39:29,738 --> 00:39:32,056
leading his poor nephews in this.

383
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:41,461
The b boy pleading that they need to sail away and kinda really the Nephew was the only one keeping his head and and looking pretty annoyed.

384
00:39:42,473 --> 00:39:42,973
Understandably.

385
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:50,960
And we get this moment where the... They start to get pepper with what the b boy believes to be Barks shot

386
00:39:51,936 --> 00:39:55,106
but but the Nephew points out that it's nothing but petrified

387
00:39:55,642 --> 00:39:58,612
rain, and we learned something really key

388
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:08,496
Do you wanna tell us what we learn about that? Yeah. It's it turns out to be petrified ring. It's it's not Barks at at all. It's just passing through the raise of effects,

389
00:40:09,511 --> 00:40:14,151
Scrooge realizes that as the rain is getting far enough away, turns back into water,

390
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,130
So

391
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:19,305
he zones correctly that if they move the nephews away,

392
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:24,240
if they move down and the nephews away, they'll turn back to normal. And

393
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:35,666
So there's a nice little exchange. They're coming back to life. Their heads are getting soft and Scrooge says well, let's hope they don't get as soft as mine. And then immediately, we're full on screw hero mode

394
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:46,630
where it says, now I have another job to do. This time I've got to save the whole world. This is I'm pretty Gladstone highlighted that. That's that's pretty weird for

395
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:48,885
he's not usually

396
00:40:49,305 --> 00:41:01,689
interested in having Scrooge be the hero. Well, well, it's immediately dash their next panel on the page, you know, because the global reader in that, is like, wow Scrooge is, you know, being so

397
00:41:02,266 --> 00:41:13,877
thought lesson. I mean... Mean he's being so you know, he's he's considering of faith of the world. But then it's like, does march just take the rate of the mainland, They could petri the police and climb all my money. So

398
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:20,653
it's self interest once again. Yeah. So so Barks always has to his character.

399
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:29,178
Right. If if something is going well for Donald in one of these stories, like can say the brittle mass your

400
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,123
or if he's having some big success,

401
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:35,097
you know, he's gotta have something

402
00:41:35,514 --> 00:41:37,665
fall, him he's gotta get some

403
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:41,425
and and same thing with Scrooge, if he's showing some

404
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:47,340
mobility, I guess he's gotta tampa that by having him think about his money again.

405
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:54,074
Before we go on, you know, it is really affecting. I I felt nervous watching Scrooge

406
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,651
and the the one nephew carefully

407
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,689
lowering the petrified

408
00:41:59,028 --> 00:41:59,528
duct

409
00:42:00,066 --> 00:42:00,566
down.

410
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:09,723
You know, that that definitely felt stressful to me. I'm also used Al Scrooge pondering. I'm I must be too tough to petri.

411
00:42:10,421 --> 00:42:10,735
Okay

412
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:12,509
So Scrooge

413
00:42:12,868 --> 00:42:20,005
does go to approach as he says the whole martian army to to try and lick him with the... His bare hands.

414
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:20,960
And

415
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:31,611
while he's off, the Nephew is talking with the bill boy asking if he really ever saw or heard anything of him and he explains that I I didn't. I don't know anything

416
00:42:32,188 --> 00:42:42,090
except for the first two months I was here because he's been there for seven months. The first two months I was here, I smelled cabbage cooking Severino day.

417
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,250
So we're we're back to the this weird

418
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:47,821
running gag slash,

419
00:42:48,637 --> 00:42:55,318
I don't know of of cabbage being very important in this story And then we flash back to Scrooge.

420
00:42:55,798 --> 00:43:03,270
It is a nice suspense moment as he kind of sneaks past some groves of coconut trees and gets close.

421
00:43:03,923 --> 00:43:06,498
And then we get this view

422
00:43:06,836 --> 00:43:10,865
of where the problem is coming from. Do you wanna characterize it that?

423
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:19,171
Yeah. It almost... It it almost looks like a margin creation the way it is. It's it looks like a mechanical masters

424
00:43:19,525 --> 00:43:24,779
hissing and sci and spotting and singing and f all at once. And,

425
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:27,296
yeah, It's really the only

426
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,508
I I can see why that this story...

427
00:43:31,087 --> 00:43:34,423
If this this panel sort of defines why this

428
00:43:34,843 --> 00:43:37,235
story might be lower on people's lists

429
00:43:37,894 --> 00:43:40,429
because a lot of the other earlier stories

430
00:43:40,847 --> 00:43:45,417
with Scrooge, they have more spec than this. And this is, like, the only

431
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:56,405
half page panel that's like this and Right. It's it's not I mean, it it it is a little terrifying, but it's it's almost a little under we

432
00:43:56,865 --> 00:44:03,145
considering all the personal drama that the characters have been going through up to this point. So it's like, yeah.

433
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,274
Okay. We see that this is too terrifying, but, you know, it's almost like, oh, well, that's not that's so not so scary. You know?

434
00:44:11,073 --> 00:44:12,292
I Almost

435
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:12,831
yeah.

436
00:44:13,565 --> 00:44:19,112
I I think that's right. It's a little under overwhelming. I I think it's about as as cool.

437
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:29,677
About as good of a payoff as he could make based on kind of the trajectory of the story. But that you're right that compared to, like, some of the the real sci

438
00:44:30,294 --> 00:44:31,192
splash panels

439
00:44:31,545 --> 00:44:32,284
in trauma

440
00:44:32,901 --> 00:44:37,870
or. Only a poor man or Right. Or or whatever recently,

441
00:44:38,328 --> 00:44:46,453
that it's not It doesn't have that much of a punch. It is cool. Right? And it's definitely got some of the, like, fifties

442
00:44:46,765 --> 00:44:47,584
sci f five

443
00:44:48,761 --> 00:44:49,819
Really seen.

444
00:44:50,637 --> 00:44:55,705
Yeah. It's neat. But I I definitely... I do think it... It's a little under well.

445
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:57,538
Well, especially

446
00:44:57,956 --> 00:44:59,334
what what comes after

447
00:45:00,071 --> 00:45:04,483
is frankly more terrifying than than the side of the array itself.

448
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,452
Scrooge gets captured and he doesn't get to see his character

449
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,609
because he's locked in a basket

450
00:45:10,987 --> 00:45:12,580
and it turns out it's this

451
00:45:13,517 --> 00:45:14,017
prospect,

452
00:45:14,634 --> 00:45:21,712
shirtless, old man, one of those creepy creatures of Barks is where he gives them ears even though they're birds

453
00:45:22,104 --> 00:45:22,803
Oh, yeah.

454
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:26,629
He he runs right out and hurts

455
00:45:27,005 --> 00:45:28,063
Scrooge pirates

456
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,671
and he and he starts

457
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:30,630
x.

458
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:34,664
And, like, even when the beagle boys bleeds with them do not shoot,

459
00:45:35,003 --> 00:45:39,816
he petri verifies the big any gets donald, but the nephew is escape to the boat.

460
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:41,416
I that's frankly,

461
00:45:42,776 --> 00:45:44,995
it's frankly a better payoff to that

462
00:45:45,430 --> 00:46:00,728
sight of that. It's a better payoff than the side of that gray is. That this professor is such a goof ball. He's so weird. And he's mer. As you say, he really... He really goes for them. And his little portable

463
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,856
touch certification array. It really looks... It evo one of those old fashioned like,

464
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:10,004
Al d

465
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:15,824
or... Yeah. Yeah exactly what it is. That's what's why it's one because it's old... It's old tiny.

466
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:24,082
That's a common theme with Barks something old time or, you know, constantly... So something common, but it it does something incredible.

467
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:24,881
Right.

468
00:46:25,654 --> 00:46:28,347
Right. It's what Donald was using to

469
00:46:28,683 --> 00:46:31,735
spray fires when he was firm and donald, basically.

470
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:33,608
And and

471
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:36,015
we we get the professor

472
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:36,832
thoughts.

473
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:45,681
Right? He clearly thinks that they're all just criminals and and like the b boys who have come to try and pill what's his.

474
00:46:46,018 --> 00:46:50,386
And, you know, the the nephews do make it back to their boat,

475
00:46:50,844 --> 00:47:01,205
and they plan to go away for help. But Scrooge has the ignition key with him. So again, it's some type plotting there. Filling in those platforms holes. And

476
00:47:02,383 --> 00:47:08,037
we get this fun silhouette of the professor pushing around the large version.

477
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:16,851
Of his invention. And he's thinking to himself. Nobody must stop me before I have finished my great invention. And that's an interesting

478
00:47:17,245 --> 00:47:24,771
right? Because like first off, you know, as far as we can tell that the invention is finished. It's something that that it's like ind,

479
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:25,508
maybe.

480
00:47:26,186 --> 00:47:42,316
And and what else could he be working on? This is what he's creators is pretty terrifying. Yes. So the nephews, they don't have a lot of options here, but they do just... One of them remembers what the vehicle mentioned about cabo.

481
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:45,691
Mh and smelling it cooking for two months.

482
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:59,036
So they... The kind of is like, well, what do we got to lose? Let's start cooking some up. And it's it's goofy and it's silly, but the way he's set it up, it does... It is logical. Right? What else can they do?

483
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:14,596
Mh. Do you wanna tell us about the next page where the adjuster is looking out over the cliff? Yes. He's about to set the ray on them, but this the scent of that cabbage. All my drilling taste buds, he immediately gets on board swimming,

484
00:48:15,396 --> 00:48:17,130
dropping off his equipment, know,

485
00:48:17,968 --> 00:48:19,227
losing all his agencies

486
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,100
just like and he gets tied up immediately,

487
00:48:22,718 --> 00:48:23,218
and

488
00:48:23,556 --> 00:48:31,946
he says, I'll talk. I'll do anything if you just give me a butter of that wonderful tasty cabbage It's... It's it's quite a quite a turn

489
00:48:32,806 --> 00:48:34,121
because this was one this

490
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:36,201
supposedly leave the character,

491
00:48:36,701 --> 00:48:38,241
you know, it just that becomes just

492
00:48:38,781 --> 00:48:41,801
completely helpless just Al the percent of disgusting.

493
00:48:43,061 --> 00:48:43,141
Right.

494
00:48:44,193 --> 00:48:46,367
Right. It's it's a weird turn.

495
00:48:47,023 --> 00:48:50,950
And so we transition back to sc in his basket.

496
00:48:51,661 --> 00:49:02,006
And he sees the kids returning with what he thinks is the martian monster. But the Inducks, the Nephews quickly explained that he's actually a scientist from Du burn conveniently.

497
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:04,926
Mh. And and we get a little bit of quick

498
00:49:05,346 --> 00:49:06,406
exposition about

499
00:49:06,866 --> 00:49:12,094
how he invented the ray while trying to take the fumes out of the.

500
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:14,567
That is the whole

501
00:49:15,184 --> 00:49:19,216
allegation for this fairly dark and suspense

502
00:49:19,716 --> 00:49:20,996
smart that this, like,

503
00:49:21,836 --> 00:49:27,587
kind of a mystery. Right? And and so he he came here to the islands

504
00:49:28,004 --> 00:49:35,666
afraid that the ray would fall into the hands of bad people. Mean, he's been working on his cabbage and we can see that he's really

505
00:49:36,046 --> 00:49:41,766
distraught that every time he perfect the cabbage, he took out... He also took out the taste.

506
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:51,806
And and he's essentially lived in fear of pirates ever since the beagle came, and he had to turn the ray on them and and he's

507
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:55,486
it references him being trapped there by a typhoon.

508
00:49:56,066 --> 00:49:56,266
Mh.

509
00:49:56,906 --> 00:50:06,973
What do you think that about the next page where screwed tells him you're wasting your time with simplest cabbage, whether that ray would make you master of the world. Mh.

510
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:11,198
Yes. I I've always liked this little bit of Barks philosophy

511
00:50:11,696 --> 00:50:15,647
Sure, but there are too many masters in the world already and not enough france.

512
00:50:16,301 --> 00:50:16,801
It's...

513
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:19,561
You know, I I just can't help thinking that this...

514
00:50:19,941 --> 00:50:21,281
It's just step definitely

515
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:29,536
almost gyro two point two point o or something or an alternate version of them. Because he's got very dry like ten cs

516
00:50:29,996 --> 00:50:34,106
especially the early jay he's more app and mind. Know he's more.

517
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:36,180
He's got the glasses.

518
00:50:36,637 --> 00:50:37,656
Alright. And

519
00:50:38,352 --> 00:50:45,684
and it's definitely a gyro that he would invent something by acts I'm trying to do something else. Think he... Is is...

520
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,512
This character doesn't have a name that's professor.

521
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:56,028
Right. And I I think that's just his way of saying, well, I kinda of wanted to use Ji, but I couldn't because he's established.

522
00:50:56,406 --> 00:50:58,662
So here's this other similar character.

523
00:50:59,136 --> 00:51:08,577
And Gyro sorta got the same viewpoint on life too. It's like, no, no. I I I don't wanna do that because, you know, the world's bad enough, why would I wanna take over or do anything?

524
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:18,001
Yeah. I I completely agree with everything you said there. Right? That was well stated he he seems like such a stand for Dry that you feel like maybe Barks

525
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:25,620
considered using Gyro but couldn't quite figure out how it works. And right since he already knows the Ducktales.

526
00:51:26,038 --> 00:51:27,711
Especially that as spec.

527
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:34,031
They would all know him already. Right. And it is a good line. I think that's probably the only reason

528
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:47,154
that he has screwed say something so weird like he's encouraging him to take over the world. Right? I think we're just he wanted him to say that good line about how there are too many masters and enough friends. Mh.

529
00:51:48,111 --> 00:52:00,870
And then and we get the the second little turning point here. You know, we think that everything is okay. But it turns out that the nephews of noticed that they they've been approached by the b boys. Mh.

530
00:52:01,949 --> 00:52:03,767
Who have the ray

531
00:52:04,226 --> 00:52:05,265
aimed at them,

532
00:52:05,864 --> 00:52:06,963
And they have a pretty

533
00:52:07,342 --> 00:52:07,842
specific

534
00:52:08,356 --> 00:52:08,856
threat

535
00:52:09,196 --> 00:52:11,236
here. Do you wanna tell us there a threat? Yes.

536
00:52:12,516 --> 00:52:20,255
Surrender or will fire your nephew forever. And and this is this is why I like this story that it shows a lot of character beads.

537
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:26,606
There's no real jokes here. Scrooge sees the seriousness of the situation it tells them.

538
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:30,273
Now how you hire my nephew is I'll pay you any price to let them go

539
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:55,352
and it's like, any price, even all of your three cubic acres of genuine money, and yes. Even my last sixteen cents. And the beagle boys sc this off. And, you know, because they're gonna get everything in the world with this array. We'll where will pill and wondering and grand style and Scrooge of course, what a horrible faith to fall the world? These guys are gonna be masters great.

540
00:52:56,886 --> 00:52:58,946
And there's this wonderful page.

541
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,286
It's almost entirely the beagle boys.

542
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,796
Both thing about what they're gonna do to the world with

543
00:53:07,175 --> 00:53:09,892
with styles mansions with two thousand bathtub tops.

544
00:53:10,426 --> 00:53:18,406
Why the bathtub. We never take Barks. They're to hold our jeweler you un cool ru in. You know, they're doing their trademark dance with their

545
00:53:18,826 --> 00:53:22,852
they're showing off their that they're terrible, terrible, terrible

546
00:53:23,389 --> 00:53:23,889
behavior.

547
00:53:24,385 --> 00:53:32,786
We're gonna be Al of the world with kings and presence growing at our feet. And we want turkey for breakfast with Turkey. And here's what we were alluding to earlier.

548
00:53:33,306 --> 00:53:35,621
And we when we approves for breakfast

549
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:44,526
Everyone's... All the other big boys scream at him. Shut off. They have proof for breakfast to Every morning and prison. Are you getting home sick and really

550
00:53:44,865 --> 00:53:52,117
minuscule, the one big was, but I like pros. And I think this is just playing off. You know, we had one disgusting

551
00:53:52,871 --> 00:53:53,371
characteristic

552
00:53:53,951 --> 00:53:58,691
disgusting food already with the cabbage. Here's another that's an acquired taste pros.

553
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:14,440
Acquired taste is pretty generous. Right? Yes. I I don't know if this is universal around the world. But like, prune are kind of a punch line in the states. Right? Yes. Because, like, You're an old prone. You're an old prune. Yeah. You're old. Your.

554
00:54:14,897 --> 00:54:14,977
Yeah.

555
00:54:15,814 --> 00:54:20,476
No one likes prune. The only reason you eat a prune is if you're like cons

556
00:54:20,895 --> 00:54:35,098
Yeah. I need to go. They're they're for old people. So so there's a lot of humor in this one big boy randomly loving prune. And, you know, Bark? Like he doesn't do a ton of running gag that span

557
00:54:35,753 --> 00:54:40,702
stories. Right? Like Right. Heat but he'll actually come back to this one Google,

558
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,537
liking prune in at least a couple other stories.

559
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:50,080
Over, like his whole career, I think it was the Giant Robot Roberts. Mh.

560
00:54:50,759 --> 00:54:51,259
And...

561
00:54:51,757 --> 00:54:55,345
Oh, the one horse around with history, Right.

562
00:54:55,843 --> 00:55:15,567
So, like, he remembered that. He liked that shit It it's it's very funny. Mh. And And it's also something that, like, people in the whole dot community. Oh, yes. We we... All all of us who have worked with the docs have worked with the being Al boys. We've all tried to incorporate prune at one point or another

563
00:55:15,905 --> 00:55:20,291
Right. It's it's just a just a wonderful little gag that this

564
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:27,267
fog has, you know, he he has a tape his his taste bud is for for proof something

565
00:55:27,723 --> 00:55:28,223
something

566
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:29,435
And it's something

567
00:55:29,853 --> 00:55:33,466
they probably would serve in a prison in the fifties because it's cheap.

568
00:55:33,805 --> 00:55:36,540
Right. Right. So it's a good bit.

569
00:55:36,878 --> 00:55:45,965
And the beetle boys you know, they keep talking and arguing amongst themselves while screwed Yeah. Understanding there. Yeah. That's that's... Yeah. That's a good segway.

570
00:55:46,956 --> 00:55:58,921
That find that the final panel is Scrooge. She's leaning against the trees. Like, well, make up your mind. You asked me to surrender. What happens next? Like, alright enough of this. Right. Because it's just it has going on for the whole page.

571
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:05,262
Yeah. For a fairly short story, he devote a a pretty good amount of time to the beagle Al.

572
00:56:06,076 --> 00:56:15,704
Wrong. And I... I like that part of the story. I find it among the more memorable Barks up there with, like, the the the view of the array and the petrified

573
00:56:16,201 --> 00:56:28,879
animals. Those are probably the things that I remembered best from this one. So they they remember that they're looking for the boat key and they tell screws to hand it over, and we get this interesting exchange where the professor

574
00:56:29,216 --> 00:56:33,281
very confidently tells him Don't listen to them, don't do it.

575
00:56:33,981 --> 00:56:50,637
And we can tell that for some reason the professor knows that he actually has the upper hand. Mh. And and as the b boys go to go to freeze them, Go to petri them. We we learn what that upper hand is. It's the fact that he has key

576
00:56:50,950 --> 00:57:02,836
in the way to the yes. In his pocket. Yes. I I love this dialogue. It's like, they can't make the raise why for the same reason they can't make your boat z. I have the key in my pocket

577
00:57:03,696 --> 00:57:05,636
and. Yeah. It's a it's a well.

578
00:57:06,096 --> 00:57:07,116
It's a well

579
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:19,257
weld developed bit of dialogue. It it is. It and it is. It's such a deflation. It like, you cheated Al your is, like, yeah. I... Yeah. Of course, I'm not care you... Idiot if think I left the key to the

580
00:57:19,993 --> 00:57:20,493
unattended

581
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:24,318
and and the the professor gets like, downright

582
00:57:24,711 --> 00:57:26,529
gl again. Yeah. Always he's

583
00:57:27,307 --> 00:57:30,164
as he, like, uses this his little manual

584
00:57:30,663 --> 00:57:31,462
thing to Yeah.

585
00:57:32,555 --> 00:58:08,901
It his man... His manual... His manual pump brett and his manual pump. And I just didn't... I I... And I enjoy it this time that is Al because did they deserve that what's gonna happen. So let's not have any more rough stuff boy. Right. Right. And and so, you know, they're their journey on this island kinda wraps up with the the Inducks telling the beagle that they're gonna need to construct to raf to get home because there's enough room on the boat. I do like that panel of them crying amongst themselves about of all the people in the world those Ducktales to be the ones that got my bottle message.

586
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,479
Mh.

587
00:58:10,158 --> 00:58:15,208
And the professor just gonna hang out on his island, because now he's got a great supply of

588
00:58:15,841 --> 00:58:16,700
of cabbage,

589
00:58:17,279 --> 00:58:39,546
and he can blast the world with his future invention of fu cabbage. Yes. There's another good little bit with that that. What what do you think? Are we are we over doing the gag here when Donald says what a pity he hasn't got it invented now. No. He's just got reinforce, you know, this is definitely one of Barks is gross or stories.

590
00:58:40,085 --> 00:58:55,011
And and, you know, you just gotta keep throwing it in at every turn. And we're we're not done with it quite yet, but... And we've got we got the great explanation too because it's probably what we were wondering as readers is right. That long last mystery. Yes.

591
00:58:55,771 --> 00:59:01,282
Why didn't the ray pack find Scrooge desks and the professor asks, I'd like to know that myself,

592
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:08,031
something is in your skin and in your clothing that deflect the ray. Gold dust. My goodness, mister,

593
00:59:09,271 --> 00:59:10,731
You roll in money.

594
00:59:11,431 --> 00:59:15,466
We won't discuss that. And it's together. Like, it it would you...

595
00:59:15,926 --> 00:59:24,568
It's the outside world that doesn't know screw. Like, going, I wait what how does this happen wouldn't Sanity is this. You've got gold dusting in your skin?

596
00:59:25,206 --> 00:59:27,201
It's it's a great book.

597
00:59:27,655 --> 00:59:29,594
Yeah. Right. It so

598
00:59:29,973 --> 00:59:56,070
because he didn't call... He he didn't do the callback until the very end. That's why it works so well. And Right. And as Readers, you might have forgotten well what was the point of them coming out here in the first place and Barks conveniently reminds you, and it sets up the ending. Right. And we've got that great, like the the same pose with the professor holding the Al magnifying glass just like the doctor and Scrooge blushing.

599
00:59:56,965 --> 01:00:01,552
And and that makes it funny. Right? Yeah. The the way that he's concerned... Yes.

600
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:10,488
Yes. And and so... And and as far as I'm concerned, that beat is is, like, the end of the story. He he just kinda like

601
01:00:10,866 --> 01:00:15,181
let sit lang grossly and with a little bit of their boat voyage home

602
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:21,311
and one last exchange where Donald tells him, you know, you better get back to cooking dinner,

603
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:25,419
but but he's fed up with that. He says, you cook Isles.

604
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:28,728
You know I'm a sick dot and he he

605
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:33,772
It's a cute panel. He stairs with his feet while he hears himself out

606
01:00:34,389 --> 01:00:42,930
and Donald old finishes closes the story out by just being really annoyed at how you just can't win with uncle around as he is

607
01:00:43,269 --> 01:00:44,528
yet again cooking

608
01:00:44,947 --> 01:00:45,866
stinky cabbage.

609
01:00:46,481 --> 01:00:46,841
Mh.

610
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,341
Yeah. So that that wraps it up.

611
01:00:49,801 --> 01:00:51,981
I can sort of see why

612
01:00:52,321 --> 01:00:54,941
someone like you would con... Who's not particularly

613
01:00:55,615 --> 01:00:58,550
you know, one favorites says it's un remarkable.

614
01:00:59,247 --> 01:01:01,224
And it kind of is, but

615
01:01:01,562 --> 01:01:14,243
it's just... It has a lot of character and the And that's what I really don't like about a lot of the uncle Scrooge stories in general that they start to follow a formula very fast.

616
01:01:14,595 --> 01:01:15,233
Know, it's...

617
01:01:15,991 --> 01:01:25,238
Scrooge Donald will get in trouble and the nephews find some way to get out of it. This is very much all the characters are present for throughout.

618
01:01:26,294 --> 01:01:32,302
Donald not so much. And how you even the Nephew is not so much either because this

619
01:01:32,974 --> 01:01:39,937
Scrooge really drives all of the story Because you yeah because it's it's unique in that he's the only

620
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:44,866
person, the stone rate does affect. So kinda... It's it's almost.

621
01:01:45,444 --> 01:01:58,341
It's almost a superhero story and that sense. Because he's got this power and none of the other characters have. Yeah. That's a good point, and it's true more than a lot of the so called uncle Scrooge stories. This really is like

622
01:02:00,275 --> 01:02:06,877
specifically about uncle Scrooge. Mh. A lot of them are are as much about donald or than use Al they are.

623
01:02:07,812 --> 01:02:07,972
You know,

624
01:02:09,382 --> 01:02:13,649
One of the things I I really enjoy about doing this show and, like,

625
01:02:14,566 --> 01:02:15,784
diving into

626
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:55,729
obsessively into the specifics of these is that I do end up, like, finding a lot to appreciate about stories that maybe I hadn't, like, really sat down and thought about. And as we... As we went through the story, that there's a lot that that we talked about and that you pointed out and and kinda advocated for that. Made me realize, hey, you know, this this story does actually have quite a bit going for it. There's there some really unique really cool things. The the kinda ominous tone is very unique. I I wouldn't say that, like, my opinion has shifted. So like say it's like a favorite, all of a sudden.

627
01:02:56,068 --> 01:03:01,442
But but I it it definitely is kind of an average Barks adventure

628
01:03:01,915 --> 01:03:07,540
and an average Barks adventure is like, it's still really really good. Still yeah.

629
01:03:08,138 --> 01:03:09,730
Exactly. That's pretty

630
01:03:10,547 --> 01:03:13,921
error to be in. Just to just be a a good

631
01:03:14,418 --> 01:03:20,063
Barks story is is really saying a lot. And this one does have a lot going for it.

632
01:03:20,942 --> 01:03:30,958
Mh. I I do still have some problems. You know, I do find parts of it under well and the I've never really gotten over what a what a goof ball the professor

633
01:03:31,296 --> 01:03:40,816
is. Well, yeah. He kinda of this. He he almost is kind of enough thing. You know, like I said, he's a stand for jo and kind of on

634
01:03:42,056 --> 01:03:44,411
It's it... What defines the

635
01:03:44,871 --> 01:03:49,631
it how overwhelming he is is that he bark to even bother to give him a name.

636
01:03:50,111 --> 01:03:51,866
Right. Yeah. Definitely.

637
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:54,666
Such to cruise so for such a crucial character.

638
01:03:55,526 --> 01:04:06,306
And it's interesting too. Now that I think about. I just had this thought in so many of the early Scrooge and and for colored donald, you know, he really wants to go on like that mass

639
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:11,767
geographic journey. Mh. And he wanted to, like pick a little bit about

640
01:04:12,144 --> 01:04:19,561
the the location or or with the legend of whatever he was talking about, and and this story has such a like anonymous

641
01:04:20,218 --> 01:04:22,514
setting that doesn't have any

642
01:04:22,852 --> 01:04:24,166
underlying, like, cultural

643
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:29,379
significance, really. And, yes, I just looked up, like just refresh my memory...

644
01:04:29,819 --> 01:04:34,291
If you look... If you just Google war of the world's, and look up the illustrations.

645
01:04:34,991 --> 01:04:44,372
You're gonna see the ray that Barks. Huey, stole right from H d wells. So... Right. Right. And that that is the... This is see this... This show

646
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,047
educate me as to how

647
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:59,546
underdeveloped a lot of other just a knowledge and pop culture. But, yes, that is that is the the ray in that panel is just a direct rip off of the fighting machine and war of the world.

648
01:04:59,886 --> 01:05:08,352
And I think that's probably why it's well because Barks wasn't doing anything original he just stole it. Yeah. That that was my.

649
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:16,307
Why don't you look Al up right now yourself, Mark just really quick. Is going together. I will, but I can I can totally

650
01:05:16,685 --> 01:05:18,143
picture it? Al The

651
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,271
fighting machine war of the world's

652
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:21,989
Google it's it's.

653
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:29,936
Yeah. Yeah just be already just store it. See, so this is So this is another important lesson and, you know,

654
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:32,836
theft is a part of.

655
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:53,251
It really is. I mean, I see so many people crying fall when, you know, people see, like, oh, you crib from this. It's like, well, call Barks crib from H g. Wells. I mean what's the big deal, you know? He just... He just uses his Al element in a story. You know, it's... That... That's... You know, not... You know, there are only so many original ideas on earth

656
01:05:53,789 --> 01:05:54,289
obviously.

657
01:05:54,866 --> 01:05:59,114
So, you know, that that can be forgiven. But that that is a that is a blatant

658
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:12,226
Al blatant been play Al I'm there, though. I'm glad. I'm glad that you agree because, honestly, I was surprised that I never really saw it mentioned in, like, any of the commentary by Jeffrey Blu.

659
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:18,463
Or anyone else. Maybe someone's pointed it out before, but I'm just gonna go ahead and say that I I I nailed that.

660
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:40,024
Yes. You did. Yeah. Okay. Well, despite that, bit of theft. I I just think it's a really fun story. It's always stood out. I remember is it teenager I asked. My friend David Ge who is the archive editor on the Gems Barks. It's like can you reprint this one? Because it hasn't been printed in years and years and

661
01:06:40,922 --> 01:06:43,460
turned out in June my birthday month,

662
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:55,212
this mysterious stone ray showed up and the uncle Scrooge jumps own Barks. So nice. Yes. So I I don't think that was that intentional, but I like to think of it that why? That's a happy coincidence.

663
01:06:55,685 --> 01:06:59,102
Right. So let's talk about, you know, the community

664
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,118
impression. I always use Inducks

665
01:07:02,478 --> 01:07:18,169
as kind of a representation It's not perfect, but it's by far the best, like, way to judge what the overall community thinks of a story. And people have voted this one to a seven point nine out of ten, which

666
01:07:18,627 --> 01:07:20,923
lands it at number forty seven.

667
01:07:21,381 --> 01:07:40,890
On on the list of all Disney comics. Well, see, I I think that's reflecting it bet I might have talked about it. But, you know, the worldwide perception is that the screws stories are as best work. So Inducks is incorporating a lot of that and they're rating Yeah. I I think that's probably right. I think that the

668
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:41,810
original,

669
01:07:42,228 --> 01:07:44,702
like, the the earliest screwed stories, Severino

670
01:07:45,181 --> 01:07:53,134
like... Well, this was an Scrooge number eight. Right? It must be great. It was one of those Scrooge screws right I think... I think that's a little bit generous.

671
01:07:53,811 --> 01:08:13,336
It is. I don't... Even if I was thinking if I really had the do it. I I think this one might be lucky to be at my own top fifty of the Barks stories, but that's only because so many of the ten pages would take it up before that Right. Because if you like, pull out, you know, the the stories by like there are some Gottfredson

672
01:08:13,655 --> 01:08:16,555
stories and rot stories and cassie,

673
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:25,185
and a couple of rows the stories probably in the top fifties. So if you build them out, that that makes it like a top thirty story roughly and.

674
01:08:26,161 --> 01:08:35,580
That's that's that's generous. This is a good story Mh. And and is is memorable in a lot of ways, but I do think that that's overly generous

675
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:55,169
Nothing against people who call this one of their favorites. It it's... I I... You know, I I know where I stand, Like, I I don't know if I like it enough. Where I would consider a a top favor, but I like... I like it too much to, like, you know, just a nissan hand sure. Yeah it's definitely

676
01:08:55,987 --> 01:09:24,046
out of that fan of the fan print is definitely my favorite and that's in that book and anyway So... Yeah. Which one was that in? That one that's that's in the Severino city book. Right. So I I think some cities is self. I probably enjoy a lot more. Right. There's it's it's... Yeah. It's definitely got more of the flavor of what people would like in a Scrooge story. Know. There some fun ones from that era. Sure. Sure. No. It's some...

677
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:32,810
It... I I just... I just like it two much. I I don't wanna dismiss it at all. But I I would definitely agree that the Inducks rating is

678
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:40,970
little skewed, but a lot of index ratings are skewed. So... Right. But I'll as we've discussed and we've learned

679
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:45,575
in the past, hey it it gives us something to talk about. Or I love that.

680
01:09:46,707 --> 01:09:50,796
Is not you gotta hang your podcast around something structural.

681
01:09:51,332 --> 01:09:54,903
Right. So so we also talk about kind of other references

682
01:09:55,975 --> 01:10:16,075
and follow ups. Now to my knowledge Barks never did any kind of a painting for this one. But know it's kinda says Al all he didn't think of it as too memorable. Yeah. I don't think it would have been a great subject for a painting. He did paintings for some pretty un memorable stories, but they definitely had had some key moments. Mh.

683
01:10:17,075 --> 01:10:17,550
I

684
01:10:17,969 --> 01:10:29,120
I I took a little look, and I didn't remember. I couldn't come across any time that this might have been adapted into a tail story. Mh. For either of the the series.

685
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:43,532
That now there was one big follow ups. Yeah. So one of Don Rosa is the earliest stories. Right. This was a very early story of Dawn Rosa, and I'm I'm gonna confess that I I read the rosa story

686
01:10:43,991 --> 01:10:46,149
before I read the Barks original.

687
01:10:46,668 --> 01:10:48,846
Yeah. The... This this was

688
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:56,100
you know, as everyone knows, I I quote unquote shade dan rosa I don't hate Don Rosa. I just

689
01:10:56,655 --> 01:10:58,952
We we hate any creator

690
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:12,136
podcast. Right. People are welcome to be critical of them, of course. Right. But I'm not the biggest fan, but I do enjoy his early stuff, but the... His cash flow story,

691
01:11:12,553 --> 01:11:20,477
it it just hinges too much on you knowing that this... That's why you probably baffled this kid when you read it before because, you know,

692
01:11:21,316 --> 01:11:22,670
you remembered this character

693
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:23,670
from

694
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:27,290
what is... What we've already discussed is not one of Barks,

695
01:11:27,969 --> 01:11:30,070
you know, top tier stories

696
01:11:30,464 --> 01:11:30,964
and

697
01:11:31,302 --> 01:12:00,470
it hinges on the device that he doesn't remember the beagle boys at all. And it's it's really dumb. It's sorry guys. It's So that is a weird element. Now I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna say something maybe a little controversial. And I I I've heard people express the a lot of people who like know the story as well. They do tend to feel more warm towards Roses early stories. I Mh. I love cash flow. I love it. I think it's stronger than this story actually.

698
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:09,805
Well, I'll have I'll have to re look at it again because I keep seeing it on my shelf I picked up the slip cover with the too earliest fan graphics,

699
01:12:10,365 --> 01:12:11,120
Rosa books

700
01:12:12,059 --> 01:12:16,235
oh I keep find the second one. It showed it's it showed up randomly

701
01:12:16,574 --> 01:12:21,604
for fifty bucks, which is the list price, but I just took Al, like Alright. I'll grab it. Fine.

702
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:28,098
Because I actually had a freebie before, but someone over at my apartment I gifted it to. But

703
01:12:28,848 --> 01:12:28,928
No.

704
01:12:29,924 --> 01:12:33,292
I'll have to re look at that one then. Because like I said,

705
01:12:33,788 --> 01:12:40,695
I I do like Rose as earliest stuff. Now I I totally agree with the criticism that, like, the the professor

706
01:12:41,115 --> 01:12:50,950
shu warned in and the fact that he hasn't recognized them that that's Got it. You gotta kind of just give him that. But the story itself, and and the high concept...

707
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:53,485
That's roses strength. Right as the

708
01:12:54,145 --> 01:12:59,585
that he does, and the the two rays the follow, the sequel raise, I guess.

709
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:06,795
He... So in this one, it's a stone ray and in the follow, he does array that, like, reduces in nurse

710
01:13:07,493 --> 01:13:16,626
and another one that reduces momentum, I think. Mh. And the way that he plays that out I I think it's Rosa at his best.

711
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:17,900
So

712
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:55,035
maybe it's an artifact of me reading that one first. But might be few months It might be. I'll have to look at that myself once I I'll have to look at that again myself because I just remember the stand out just being it's just too can try that the professor doesn't remember. The guys that want tried to use his invention to take over the world. I thought that was I thought that was a little bit of too much creative license and on, mister Rose. Right. And and I remember the big say that disney professor won't remember us. And I mean in in fairness, he is a pretty busy guy. So Sure.

713
01:13:55,693 --> 01:13:59,280
But but, yeah, it's it's weird because it's not really a sequel

714
01:13:59,657 --> 01:14:09,294
to the story itself yeah the sql element is that there's another array and the b boys still that big still likes prune, and that's pretty much it.

715
01:14:10,093 --> 01:14:10,593
Pastor

716
01:14:10,932 --> 01:14:13,250
yeah fast still wants his cabbage.

717
01:14:13,664 --> 01:14:14,923
Yes. So...

718
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,475
But but I do really like that story. And,

719
01:14:19,213 --> 01:14:21,150
you know, this one

720
01:14:21,528 --> 01:14:29,724
this one's a lot of fun. Not not one of the most memorable, but definitely worth reading, and I'm I'm glad that we got to talk about this Yeah.

721
01:14:30,483 --> 01:14:34,472
And and so I I will say that I've got kind of a new

722
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:51,749
appreciation. There... There have been a few of these stories where literally as I go through and talk about it with the guest house. I like develop a real appreciation for. Oh, good. Well, good. I'm I'm glad I I'm glad my sound reasoning could help

723
01:14:52,365 --> 01:14:58,103
turn you a little bit more towards this stories favor. Yeah. So we've covered it pretty well.

724
01:14:58,641 --> 01:15:08,530
And and we did mention a number of of panels that stood out to us. Are there any that you'd like like to highlight that we didn't mention or that you think really

725
01:15:08,908 --> 01:15:09,886
kind of merit

726
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:15,739
you know, oh, this this is my favorite panel. I don't think so. Just those panels where

727
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:20,474
the doctor and the professor discovering the gold dust and his pores

728
01:15:20,814 --> 01:15:24,634
the... There's two many... There's too many masters and not enough friends

729
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:27,634
the p... That whole page with the beagle

730
01:15:27,949 --> 01:15:49,043
Yeah they're they're them showing off. I I think we got... We got all the beats covered. And I think I think that's why... I think we just sort of emphasize why this might not stand out as much because when you think of, you know, the more character driven stuff you sort of lean more towards Donald whereas this where screwed you lean more towards adventure.

731
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:53,284
And, you know, the... It's kinda like the defining, like, the split off point

732
01:15:53,905 --> 01:16:11,744
when he stopped focusing so much on donald Inducks stories and more on uncle screwed stories, you know, that that his the quality of his work went a different direction. Yeah. It definitely does feel like a dividing line. I think I I I probably agree with you there. Some of those earlier Donald Stories are more memorable.

733
01:16:12,204 --> 01:16:18,679
But there's a lot of great stuff. Oh of sorts. And... And I don't mean... I don't mean to dislike on screw... The screwed story so much

734
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:25,900
Now It wouldn't be... I wouldn't be a a Car Barks fan, you know, if if I didn't like a lot of Scrooge. So... Right.

735
01:16:26,913 --> 01:16:41,733
But... But, yeah, I I can't... No. It's I can't think of much more to say about this one, but just that I've always really had a soft spot for. Yeah. Well, and and I'll just mention we talked about a lot of my favorites. I I do like the initial

736
01:16:42,152 --> 01:16:43,650
silhouette of the beagle

737
01:16:44,324 --> 01:16:51,994
sc about in the cave. I like... I had mention Scrooge kinda airing himself out. I'm a sucker for those panels.

738
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:52,908
And

739
01:16:53,285 --> 01:16:56,017
and that opening where he's looking all joy

740
01:16:56,793 --> 01:17:02,093
flashing through his money is definitely a striking one as well. So thank you listeners

741
01:17:02,512 --> 01:17:04,131
for enjoying this

742
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:05,130
episode.

745
01:17:17,935 --> 01:17:23,455
Sure. It's a podcast I did run with the Bob Jacobs the animation director,

746
01:17:24,215 --> 01:17:25,735
Animation director running s.

747
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:31,010
Called Ka logic. We have a backlog of couple dozen episodes.

748
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:39,047
We're kinda restructuring our now, we both are pretty busy with our lives right now, but we, you know, we dissect the classic cartoons

749
01:17:39,463 --> 01:17:49,471
from the Golden age of Hollywood, New York animation and just discuss why a lot of these titles work and why some of them don't work. So if you're fan of

750
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:52,563
specifically worn cartoons and flight cartoons,

751
01:17:53,181 --> 01:17:55,520
We cover them pretty well there. So...

752
01:17:56,058 --> 01:18:00,889
And I will be working on getting our pope eye centric up so which we're a A

753
01:18:01,308 --> 01:18:02,687
exclusive for a while.

754
01:18:03,026 --> 01:18:05,743
I'm working on getting those public. So yeah.

755
01:18:06,742 --> 01:18:12,242
That's that's about the size of it. Yeah. That's great. I have listened to a couple of those. They're really good

756
01:18:12,579 --> 01:18:15,151
and, you know, that a lot of influence

757
01:18:15,488 --> 01:18:22,462
on Barks stories. Like Oh, of course. Yeah. We actually did do an episode. I specifically picked it because

758
01:18:23,278 --> 01:18:26,425
on the on donald Inducks cartoons, and we guys accepted

759
01:18:26,764 --> 01:18:32,876
the cartoon timber, which bark cole with Ga hannah. And and so we certainly... Well,

760
01:18:33,690 --> 01:18:39,343
It turns out it's we don't really like the card to that much, and we sort of go into why, but...

761
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:47,740
Yeah. Yeah. I don't remember that. One. Well, our... Well, our thoughts generally, are we love the Carl Barks stories, but we don't like the animated donald duct

762
01:18:48,157 --> 01:18:48,796
so much.

763
01:18:50,129 --> 01:18:50,629
It's...

764
01:18:51,767 --> 01:18:53,946
Something that I guess we agree with mister Rosa.

765
01:18:54,564 --> 01:19:02,024
Yeah. I mean, I I I loved them as a kid, but they don't hold. There's there's there's no there's no contest whatsoever.

766
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,658
No. Right. Absolutely.

767
01:19:04,155 --> 01:19:11,728
Yeah. Well, people should definitely check that out and and the come... Join us next time when we get to talk about

768
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:20,921
